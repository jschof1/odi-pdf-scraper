Executive summary\nThis paper reviews existing open data assessment tools, to support organisations, researchers, \nopen data leaders, and global development practitioners in conducting assessments to build \ncapacity of open data initiatives. \nSpecifically, this paper will answer three key research questions: \n1. What is the rationale for using open data assessment tools? \n2. What are the different tools available for conducting capacity assessments, and \nwhat are their key features? \n3. How effective are assessment tools currently designed for building capacity of \nopen data initiatives?\nThere are various tools for assessing different aspects of an open data initiative. Some tools \nassess the capabilities of a country or organisation to implement an open data initiative. Others \nmeasure the ongoing implementation of an open data initiative, or the quality of the data being \npublished. Others evaluate the impact created by open data. \nFor the purposes of this paper, we are particularly interested in how assessment tools can be \nused  to  provide  useful  insights  into  the  progress, opportunities, risks  and  challenges  of  \nimplementing an open data initiative – whether at the national, regional or city level.\nBased on previous research, we have chosen to categorise open data assessment tools as \nassessing either open data capabilities, implementation or impact.\n1\n  While some tools fall into \none of these categories, most overlap. Each tool has different strengths and weaknesses, \ndepending on what they focus on. Yet the tools often lack coverage of in key areas: culture \nchange, operational management, data management systems and estimating impact. \nBased  on  our  review  we  make  the  following  recommendations.  Assessment  tools  and  \nprocesses aimed at supporting open data capacity building should:\n1. Provide  practical  insights  for  managers  and  teams  implementing  open  data  \ninitiatives  on  how  they  can  improve  implementation  for  enhanced  impact.

Take a holistic view that covers all aspects of managing the open data initiative \n(including leadership, implementation, finances and user engagement practice). \nWhen  examining  implementation  aspects,  it  is  also  important  to  consider  open  \ndata within the context of the existing data management systems and capabilities, \neg how data is being collected and accessed, as well as the quality of that data \nin  case  of  any  bias,  to  identify  any  possible  issues  limiting  reliability,  access  or  \nreuse.\n3. Incorporate inputs from multiple perspectives (internal and external) to provide \na  ‘360’  view  of  the  health  of  the  initiative.  This  may  help  to  promote  greater  \nshared ownership of results and action steps flowing out of the assessment.\n4. Identify the various outcomes and impacts of open data initiatives, including \nany undesirable or unintended consequences. More effort is required to establish \ncommon impact measurement methodologies, for example, to estimate the value \nand financial sustainability of the open data initiative – particularly in developing \ncountry contexts. \n5. However, impact measurement should not be limited to only economic benefits, \nbut also consider how open data connects with furthering other policy objectives \nof  the  organisation/country.  Tools  should  also recognise   the   social   and   \nenvironmental benefits that are likely to accrue from an open data initiative \nand be able to identify suitable ways to offset the costs in order to achieve \nthose benefits. \nThis paper forms one of a series of ‘methods papers’ produced by the Open Data Institute \n(ODI), looking at the literature and practice around how to support the growth and sustainability \nof open data initiatives around the world. \nWe begin by outlining the need for assessment tools before reviewing different open data \nassessment  tools,  their  key  features  and  methodologies,  similarities  and  differences.  We \nconclude by recommending the development of a comprehensive open data assessment tool \nthat  would  be  valuable  to  organisations,  researchers,  leaders  responsible  for  implementing  \nopen  data  initiatives,  and  global  development  practitioners  involved  in  open  data  capacity  \nbuilding activities. \n\n5 How to support the capacity of open data initiatives with assessment tools | Open Data Institute 2016\n2.    Introduction\nOpen  data  is  data  that  anyone  can  access,  use  and  share.  Open  data  can  help  bring   \nefficiencies  to  policymaking,  boost  citizen  engagement  and  stimulate  innovation  and  \neconomic  growth.  Governments  and  organisations  around  the  world  are  developing  an  \nincreasing number of open data initiatives: building capacities to use and produce open data \nfor social, environmental and economic benefits.\nAs  open  data  initiatives  have  expanded  around  the  world,  tools  have  been  developed  to  \nevaluate capabilities to initiate open data policies, legislation, release and quality of open \ndatasets, technology and technical capacity. Others have been developed to estimate open \ndata’s impacts on government performance as well as its social, environmental and economic \nbenefits more broadly. \nAn assessment  tool  is  a  method  for  documenting,  usually  in  measurable  terms,  an   \norganisation’s  level  of  knowledge,  skills,  capacity  or  performance  against  predetermined  \ncriteria.  The  results  can  be  analysed  to  reveal  risks  and  opportunities,  weaknesses  and  \nstrengths, roadblocks and progress towards achieving desired objectives.\nThe various reasons for conducting an assessment means that a single tool may struggle to \ncapture all of the elements of an open data initiative. Multiple assessment tools may therefore \nbe necessary. For the purposes of this paper, we are interested in how assessment tools can \nbe used to build an organisation’s capacity to unlock a sustainable supply of open data.\nAssessing open data for global development\nWithin  the  Open  Data  for  Development  Partnership  (OD4D),  there  is  a  focus  on  different \nmethods  of  capacity  building  are  being  explored,  to  support  individuals,  organisations  and  \nsystems in developing countries to effectively plan, implement and manage impactful open \ndata initiatives.\nOne of these methods is the open data assessment tool. This paper provides an overview of \nopen data assessment tools, with practical recommendations for organisations, researchers, \nopen  data  leaders  and  global  development  practitioners  looking  to  use  them  to  build  their  \nopen data capacity. \n\n6 How to support the capacity of open data initiatives with assessment tools | Open Data Institute 2016\nWe aim to answer three key research questions: \n1. What is the rationale for using open data assessment tools? \n2. What are the different tools available for conducting capacity assessments, and \nwhat are their key features? \n3. How effective are assessment tools currently designed for building capacity of \nopen data initiatives?\n3. Assessment tools: definitions and characteristics\nThe purpose of open data assessment tools\nAs open data initiatives have multiplied in jurisdictions around the world, so too have open data \nassessment tools. These tools assess open data quality, capacities, standards and initiatives, \nto evaluate performance and help us to understand the impacts of approaches and actions to \ninform open data strategies. \nThere are several purposes for open data assessment tools, which can be grouped into five \nbroad themes, depending on who is conducting the assessment and why.\n1. Implementing  agencies  and  project  teams  can  use  them  to  assess  the  quality  \nof  datasets,  and  monitor  organisational  progress  against  the  objectives  of  \ntheir open data initiatives (including achievements) to prioritise opportunities for \nachieving maximum impact.\n2. Governments  and  citizens  can  use  them  to  benchmark  performance  against  \nother  countries,  and  identify  specific  areas  where  they  could  improve  their \ncapacity to publish and reuse open data. \n3. Businesses and social entrepreneurs can use them to identify social or commercial \nopportunities for their products or services. \n4. Researchers and journalists can understand  the  degree  of  transparency  in  a  \ncontext,  the  social  or  commercial  impacts  of  open  data,  and  identify  critical  \nareas for future research to improve open data policy and practice.\n\n7 How to support the capacity of open data initiatives with assessment tools | Open Data Institute 2016\n5. Funding agencies and open data activists can use them to strengthen advocacy \nfor investments in open data initiatives and capacity building efforts.\nFor the purposes of this paper, we are particularly interested in the first two themes, ie  how \nassessment tools can be used to support sustainable open data publication and use, through \nproviding  insights  to  managers  and  teams  about  areas  of  progress,  opportunity,  under-\nperformance or risk. While we consider the other purposes to be vital in terms of growing the \ndemand for open data, our focus is primarily upon the potential supply-side capacity-building \nbenefits. \nOpen data assessment tools as a method for capacity \nbuilding \nOngoing monitoring and evaluation of open data initiatives is vital as it helps governments and \nother implementing organisations to reveal problems, identify priority areas for improvement, \nand find opportunities for impact.\nAn assessment tool can identify how governments could engage with citizens and businesses \nbetter to stimulate demand for, and reuse of, open data. It can also determine what improvements \nare required to increase data quality and usability. If conducted in a participatory process \ninvolving external actors, including civil society, it may also help to strengthen the open data \necosystem to lay the foundation for social, economic and political impact.\nAssessment  tools  can  make  comparisons  across  countries,  governments  or  organisations  \nwhich allows for benchmarking against the performance of others. Assessments can determine \ncommon minimum features for open data initiatives to adhere to, while also promoting global \ntransparency and accountability through the publication of assessment results.\n\n8 How to support the capacity of open data initiatives with assessment tools | Open Data Institute 2016\nWho carries out assessments?\nIn  terms  of  process,  assessments  can  be  conducted  by  internal  or  external  evaluators.  \nInternally,  it  can  be  carried  out  by  an  individual  or  group,  and  rely  on  information  shared  \nthrough observations, staff meetings and focus group discussions with internal (employees, \nsenior  management,  department  heads)  and  external  stakeholders  (users,  businesses).  \nExternal  assessments  are  typically  carried  out  by  evaluators  from  outside  the  organisation  \nbeing  reviewed,  and  are  based  on  publically  available  information  or  documents  that  the  \norganisation shares as part of the assessment. It could also include interviews and site visits \nwith internal and external stakeholders. \nTo learn more about the processes followed by different assessment tools, see the Appendix.\nWhat constitutes an assessment tool?\nThe  current  landscape  of  assessment  tools  includes  both  quantitative  and  qualitative \nframeworks,  which  are  delivered  through  a  combination  of  external  and  self-assessment \nmethods. The following table provides a summary of open data assessment tools and short \ndescriptions of their methods, coverage and units of analysis. It draws on reviews presented \nin the Common Assessment Framework workshop report, the ODI’s analysis of assessment \ntools, and (unpublished) discussion notes from an International Open Data Conference 2015 \nsession on measurement.\n[See Appendix Table 1: Landscape of assessment tools]\nFrom this table, we can see that data assessment tools can be categorised using their unit \nof  analysis  –  datasets,  open  data  portals,  organisations  or  countries,  for  example  –  as  well  \nas  purpose.  Tools  may  conduct  their  measurement  at  the  level  of  the  country,  government  \nagency, or company.\nThe  ‘Common  Assessment  Framework’  originally  proposed  by  the  World  Wide  Web  \nFoundation  and  Governance  Lab  at  New  York  University,  assesses  open  data  initiatives \nusing four elements: the context where data is being released; the quality of datasets; data  \nreuse; and the impact gained from published datasets.\n2\n \n2 See Davies, T. et al (2014) Towards common methods for assessing open data: workshop report and draft framework. \n[Online] New York: The World Wide Web Foundation and the Governance Lab at NYU.

We have reframed ‘readiness’ \nas ‘capabilities’, as we are most interested in whether an initiative has the right capacity behind \nit for it to succeed, including a solid strategy and action plan. \n1. ‘Capabilities’ examines the preconditions for an open data initiative to thrive, for \nexample the Open Data Readiness Assessment developed by the World Bank.  \n3\nMeasuring capabilities can help to understand whether the conditions for an open \ndata  initiative  exist,  and  could  help  implementing  agencies  to  identify  potential  \nopportunities for impact, or what capacity gaps/challenges to expect. Important \naspects  to  assess  include  the  legal  and  regulatory  environment;  organisational  \ncontext;   political   will   and   leadership;   technical   capacity;   the   wider   social   \nenvironment, in terms of civil society and political freedoms; and the commercial \nenvironment and capacity of firms to engage with open data.\n2. ‘Implementation’ studies how open data policies are implemented and managed \non a day-to-day basis. Typically these assessments examine the extent to which \nan organisation’s initiative meets the criteria for open data, ie whether open data \nis (a) available and accessible, (b) reusable and redistributable and (c) allows for \nuniversal participation and access. Important aspects to assess relate both to data \nand use eg issues of data relevance and quality, users accessing (or providing) \nthe dataset, the purposes for which the data will be used, and the activities being \nundertaken.\n3. ‘Impact’ attempts to uncover the causal relationships between open data, its use, \nand  whether  open  data  has  resulted  in  increased  transparency,  accountability,  \ngreater  participation,  or  other  social,  governance,  environmental  and  economic  \nbenefits (and any unintended or undesirable consequences).\n3      See the World Bank’s Open Data Toolkit.

Analysis: evaluation of assessment tools for  \n building open data capacity\nIn this section, we discuss how effective assessment tools can be designed to support the \ncapacity of governments to unlock a sustainable supply of open data. \nAssessing open data capabilities\nSome assessment tools focus on the capabilities of a government to design and implement \nan open data initiative. Most of these tools analyse capabilities at the national level and use a \nchecklist or points-based rating system that can be administered internally or by an external \nagency. Points-based rating systems can encourage a government to build capacities in areas \nthat are prerequisites for the successful implementation of an open data initiative. For instance, \nthe Open Data Readiness Assessment creates a comprehensive weighted score for open data \ncapability based on an assessment of the surrounding legal and economic contexts, technical \ncapacity,  government  leadership  and  civil  society  participation  in  open  data  initiatives.  The  \nsystem  allows  governments  to  prioritise  weaker  areas  for  investment  and  capacity  building  \nactivities. \nCurrent gaps and challenges\nChecklists and points-based assessment systems offer a straightforward way of directing \ngovernments to build capacities in certain areas. However, quantitative methodologies can \nfail to capture important qualitative information. One key area is the attitude towards changing \ngovernment culture from a closed to an ‘open by default’ position. In most organisations looking \nto  implement  open  data  initiatives,  the  biggest  obstacle  is  often  a  reluctance  to  implement  \ninitiatives that promote transparency and accountability. Government officials are sometimes \nconcerned about opening data that could expose problems in the government, mistakes in \nthe data, or that could be misused by other people. \nTools based on surveys and checklists also tend to ignore context-specific information. For \ninstance, the tools focus on the legal context of open data, and rate countries highly if they \nhave  legal  provisions  for  open  data.  However,  adopting  open  data  legislation  is  a  complex  \nand  time  consuming  process,  especially  in  countries  experiencing  political  instability.  Also,  \nchecklists can be reductive in certain contexts: several countries release data without a legal \nframework or Freedom of Information laws. \n\n12 How to support the capacity of open data initiatives with assessment tools | Open Data Institute 2016\nFurther, the current range of assessment tools do not necessarily elicit the kind of practical \ninformation  that  is  useful  for  the  project  team  who  will  be  involved  in  actually  running  the  \ninitiative. A national-level assessment in including analysis of policy could be useful in delivering \nhigh-level guidance to senior leaders, but it may not equip the project team with operational-\nlevel information to inform their action plans.\nFinally, though all the tools measure different aspects of capabilities, only the ‘Open data \nin government: how to bring about change’\n4\n    report  recommendations  and  the  Open  Data  \nBarometer attempt to link the rationale for the open data initiative to the intended outcomes. \nThis linkage is important as it forms the basis for future assessments of the effectiveness and \noutcomes of open data initiatives. \nAssessing open data implementation\nMost assessment tools focus on aspects of how governments and companies implement open \ndata initiatives. Some tools, such as the Open Data Inventory and the Open Data Index and \nCensus, use checklists and point-based rating systems to evaluate countries or companies. \nOthers like the Open Data Barometer and the United Nations E-Government Survey require \nexperts to survey countries/companies and assess open data implementation.\nGenerally, tools in this category focus on data availability, quality, and data reuse. Assessing \ndata  reuse  is  important  for  several  reasons:  measuring  the  use  of  specific  data  provides \ngovernments with accurate information on demand, and increased levels of data reuse could \nindicate  the  success  of  a  government  initiative.  Only  the  Maturity  Model  Pathway  and  the  \nEuropean PSI Scorecard evaluate both data quality and reuse. \nCurrent gaps and challenges\nOverall,  we  find  a  heavy  weighting  of  tools  towards  impact  research  and/or  generating \ncomparative league tables, aimed at delivering content that is more suitable for an external \naudience  (purposes  3–5,  listed  above).  However,  there  appears  to  be  less  coverage  of  \nimplementation aspects in general to support the open data initiative itself (purpose 2).\nAlthough existing tools in this category are relatively strong on aspects of data publication and \nuse, they do not tend to provide information on how governments can improve implementation \nand  day-to-day  internal  management  of  open  data  initiatives.  In  particular,  they  do  not \n4 Broad, E. et al. (2015) Open data in government: how to bring about change. London, Open Data Institute.\n\n13 How to support the capacity of open data initiatives with assessment tools | Open Data Institute 2016\nconsider organisational aspects such as team structure, responsibilities, strategy, budgeting \nand  leadership.  Addressing  cultural  change  issues  such  as  progress  towards  developing  \nan  ‘open  mindset’,  or  improving  user  engagement  practice  are  other  content  gaps.  More  \noperational-level content, and interim progress targets is required to enable teams to measure \ntheir progress over time and position their initiative for success.\nAssessment  tools  in  this  category  typically  focus  on  certain  key  datasets  as  indicators  for  \nthe  state  of  open  data  implementation  including  election  results,  maps,  land  ownership,  \ngovernment budgets and legislation data. Limiting the sample number of datasets is practical, \nand many of these datasets are highly valuable. However, many tools do not explain how they \nextrapolate their findings from the sample of datasets to make judgements about the overall \nnational open data ecosystem. \nWe found in our review that measuring implementation poses several challenges. For instance, \nassessment tools may not capture background issues such as discrimination in data collection \nprocesses. These are issues that often relate to pre-existing data management systems, and \nare not specific to open data. However, tools that do not analyse how the data is collected run \nthe risk of ignoring biases and irregularities. \nWhile many tools focus on ensuring published data adheres to the open data definition, they \ndo not always evaluate the quality of that data. By failing to evaluate the quality, some of these \nassessment tools may overestimate the usability and usefulness of published datasets.\nFurther, automated tools that simply measure open data availability on the internet may not \naddress broader issues of who is able to access and use that data – an important consideration, \nparticularly in developing contexts with lower internet penetration. There may be other cases \nwhere  open  data  is  available,  but  is  not  used  (due  to  low  awareness,  for  example),  which  \nassessment  tools  need  to  take  into  account.  As  a  result,  assessment  tools  that  focus  on  \nimplementation should also examine how the data is collected, and any barriers to use and \nreuse.\n\n14 How to support the capacity of open data initiatives with assessment tools | Open Data Institute 2016\nAssessing open data impact\nMeasuring  impact  can  be  very  difficult,  but  several  existing  frameworks  seek  to  evaluate \nopen data impacts. There are a number of studies that have developed methods to quantify \npotential  economic  impacts  of  open  data  and  have  estimated  the  economic  value  of  open  \ndata. For instance, a European Commission commissioned study in 2006 estimated that the \neconomic value of the public sector information market was €27 billion,\n5\n  while a similar study \nin the UK estimated that the government’s open data portal (data.gov.uk) would increase its \nGDP by £28 million in 2016.\n6\n \nEight  tools  under  review  assessed  the  impact  of  open  data,  seven  of  which  used  surveys  \nand self-assessment checklists. Only the paper ‘Social impact of open data’ uses outcome \nmapping  and  case  studies  as  its  primary  methodology.\n7\n  While  tools  using  checklists  can  \ncapture information on a wide variety of impacts, the latter paper provides deeper analysis on \ninterim, indirect (or ‘downstream’) outcomes, focusing on three country case studies. Outcome \nmapping, unlike one-off assessment tools, can be used as a form of ongoing monitoring and \nevaluation to measure the progress and impact of an open data initiative.\nCurrent gaps and challenges \nAs yet, there is little consensus around measuring the economic impact of open data. Work \nneeds to continue in this area to advance common methods and understanding of estimating \neconomic impact and value for money of open data initiatives, including in developing contexts. \nIt is difficult to study the impact of something with so many potential benefits as open data. \nSelf-assessing open data impact could be a promising strategy as those who have experienced \nthe impact are best placed to report it and take ownership of results. There is, however, a risk \nof producing biased results. For instance the Open Data Impact Map\n8\n and Open Data 500\n9\n  \nrequire companies and organisations to fill in a short online survey about their use and reuse \n5      Dekkers,  M.  et  al  (2006).

Since the survey is online, it excludes organisations that have benefitted \nfrom open data, but may not have access to computers and Internet connections, creating \na biased sample. Self-reporting also relies on a common understanding of what constitutes \n‘impact’, and the distinction between open data ‘use’ and ‘impact’ is still unclear. \nAlthough most impact studies measure the economic and political benefits of open data – such \nas transparency and accountability – only the Open Data Barometer specifically measures \nenvironmental benefits. This suggests the need to look for more ways of assessing the broader \nrange of open data impacts, including benefits that accrue downstream. \n5. Conclusion and recommendations for developing  \n open data assessment tools in the future\nThe various potential benefits of open data have now been well asserted – from increases \nin efficiency of service delivery to fostering economic innovation and entrepreneurship. The \nmyriad of benefits has, in part, contributed to the difficulties around how to measure progress \nand impact. While many new tools have been developed to assess both internal and external \naspects of open data initiatives, several elements are not adequately captured by existing \nassessment tools. \nA number of recommendations emerge from this paper, which may help researchers, open data \nleaders and global development practitioners to achieve a more holistic picture of progress, \ncapacity and impact through assessment tools and processes.\n1. Provide  practical  insights  for  managers  and  teams  implementing  open  data  \ninitiatives  on  how  they  can  improve  implementation  for  enhanced  impact.  \nIn  particular,  include  some  interim  progress  targets  to  encourage  organisations  \nto learn from their experience and become more metric-driven in their approach.\n2. Take a holistic view that covers all aspects of managing the open data initiative \n(including  leadership,  implementation,  finances,  and  user  engagement \npractice). When  examining  implementation  aspects,  it  is  important  to  consider  \nopen  data  within  the  context  of  the  existing  data  management  system(s)  and  \ncapabilities eg how data is being collected and accessed, as well as the quality \nof that data in case of any bias, to identify any possible issues limiting reliability, \naccess or reuse.\n\n16 How to support the capacity of open data initiatives with assessment tools | Open Data Institute 2016\n3. Incorporate inputs from multiple perspectives (internal and external) to provide \na  ‘360’  view  of  the  health  of  the  initiative.  This  may  help  to  promote  greater  \nshared ownership of results and action steps flowing out of the assessment.\n4. Identify the various outcomes and impacts of open data initiatives, including \nany undesirable or unintended consequences. More effort is required to establish \ncommon impact measurement methodologies, for example, to estimate the value \nand financial sustainability of the open data initiative, particularly in developing \ncountry contexts. \n5. However, impact measurement should not be limited to only economic benefits, but \nalso consider how open data connects with furthering other policy objectives of the \norganisation/country. Tools should also recognise the social and environmental \nbenefits that are likely to accrue from an open data initiative and be able to \nidentify suitable ways to offset the costs in order to achieve those benefits.  \nWhat do you think?\nIf you have insights into open data assessment tools you would like to share, we want to hear \nfrom you.
