We understood in 2018 that the status quo \nwas no longer delivering on key strategies for \nsustainability, inclusion and digitisation. A rethink \nwas required to maintain our competitive advantage \nand our ability to shape a better world.\nIn 2019 we reached out to clients, our \nmembers\n and partners such as the Open \nData Institute (ODI); to listen and prototype \nnew ways\n of working. We were guided by \nour first data strategy, the ‘Data Target \nOperating Model’. Progress was made \nin working with asset management data \nin civil engineering, the use of natural \nlanguage processing in our corporate \nservices, the application of machine \nlearning in structural engineering or \nagent-based models in urban planning \nand climate change work. Towards the \nend of this phase, we developed our \nresearch programme ‘Data Supernova’ to \nhelp identify and shape critical trends.\nThroughout this work it became clear \nwhat we needed to do in the second \nphase of our data strategy ‘Creativity \nwith Data at Scale’; we have to change \nand transform our vision, leadership, \nour data infrastructure and science, our \ndata-enabled innovation, together with \nour knowledge, culture and practices.\nThis was\n not enough. Arup is not an island. \nHence we focused ‘Data Supernova’ \non two key topics: data infrastructure \nfor market openness and data enabled \nsustainable development goals. In this \nreport we focus on how the built world \ncan reduce the cost and friction between \nour clients and us, partners and the \never-growing market for refined data.\nIt is a first step, with the ODI towards an \nopen innovation process that can lead to \ncomprehensive changes in our industries.\nThis report provides critical \nfoundational concepts including \nthree approaches for sharing:\n•the default model of bilateral\ndata-sharing agreements\n•newer approaches for data pooling\n•decentralised publishing initiatives\nWhat we envision is that as sectors such \nas energy and the construction industry \nmove towards market openness, all three of \nthese activities can take place symbiotically \nand create a data market-place in which:\n1.Cost and friction are both reduced,\nleading to industry wide efficiencies,\neconomic growth and enabling\nsustainable development goals;\n2.Commercial and social platforms\nfor data sharing can prosper; an\nd\n3. Data Institutions such as Data\ntrusts or Open Implementation\nEntities will emerge.\nSince this report was published in \nMarch 2021, I have developed a visual \nrepresentation to illustrate ‘Data \nInfrastructure for Market Openness’ \n(see below). I hope readers will find it \nhelpful in further understanding these \nconcepts. It is a model where bilateral \nsharing, data pooling and decentralised \npublishing all act in harmony:\n\nExploring new approaches for sharing data in the built environment\nOpen Data Institute | March 2021 | Whitepaper 3\nIt\n is   exciting to see 2021 as the year \nwhen these newer approaches begin to \ndeliver value. The decentralised initiative \nfrom Icebreaker One is a step change for \nOpen Energy, and there is momentum \nbehind the idea for a data trust for \nconstruction or data boards in cities.\nI would like to thank our team in Arup and \nthe ODI for another excellent collaboration. \nThe ODI is an organisation we trust as a \nneutral host for the development of data \ninstitutions. They share our interest in \ndesigning or catalysing markets to move \ntowards the production of greater social, \nenvironmental and economic value from \ndata. As a result, it is an excellent (and \nagnostic) partner for this\n project.\nWe will further explore data infrastructure \nfor market openness and data enabled \nsustainable development goals at the ODI \nSummit in November.

This means that \ndata needs to be accessible to those who can use it well. \nIt needs to be at the right point on the data spectrum.\nData has the potential to help us tackle \na variety of social, environmental and \neconomic problems. Solving the biggest \nchallenges requires sharing data not just \nwithin organisations, but also between \npartners and across sectors. This requires \ninvestment in the data infrastructure \nthat can help us to use data well.\nLike other industries, the organisations \ndesigning, building, operating and \nmaintaining the built environment are \nlooking at how to create value from \ndata. In this paper we explore some of \nthe challenges and opportunities.\nThere are a range of existing approaches \nfor increasing access to data and \nopen, collaborative models for building \nand maintaining the necessary data \ninfrastructure. Data-sharing agreements \nare the default model for sharing data \nbetween organisations and for engaging \nwith researchers. They shape how data \nis used by providing clarity around the \nrights, responsibilities and permitted \nforms of reuse. But other models exist.\nPooling data from multiple organisations \nallows data to be aggregated and analysed \nin ways that individual organisations cannot \nachieve by themselves. For example, to \nsupport benchmarking and analytics that \ncan increase efficiency or improve safety. \nWith strong governance and investment \nin centralised infrastructure, organisations \ncan feel comfortable that data is being \nused within a trusted environment. \nBut centralised approaches to sharing \nand governing data are not suitable for all \nscenarios. Initiatives like open banking, \nuse another approach based around \ndecentralised publishing of data using open \nstandards and a common framework that \ngoverns how data is accessed, used and \nshared. This works well when data is best \nshared by those who collect and maintain it.\nThe right approach depends on the \npurpose of sharing data. We need to be \nclear on the challenges to be solved before \nbuilding our shared-data infrastructure.\nSmart buildings and digital twins can \nhelp us tackle a number of common \nchallenges, including the urgent need to \nadapt to a changing climate. We highlight \nhow increasing access to data can \ncontribute to tackling those challenges \nand discuss how building stronger \ndata infrastructure and independent \nstewardship of data and open standards \nare important to achieving that goal.\n\nExploring new approaches for sharing data in the built environment\nOpen Data Institute | March 2021 | Whitepaper 5\n1. Open Data Institute (2019), \n‘A manifesto for sharing \nengineering data’\n2.  Open Data Institute (2020), \n‘Data institutions’\nIntroduction\nAround the world we are facing a range of social, \neconomic and environmental challenges. A safer, \nsustainable and more resilient future will require us \nto innovate and adapt the ways in which we engineer \nand maintain the built environment, including our \ninfrastructure, energy and transport networks. \nSome data generated in the built \nenvironment sector will be either \ncommercially sensitive or personal.  \nThis data should remain private. But there \nare other datasets that could be made \nmore accessible. Increasing access to \ndata held by both the public and private \nsector will allow it to be used in ways that \nincrease safety and productivity, drive \ninnovation, tackle climate change and \nenable sustainable growth. To unlock \nthat value we need to ensure that data is \naccessed, used and shared in ways that \nare both trustworthy and sustainable.\nIn 2019, in collaboration with the Lloyd’s \nRegister Foundation, we published ‘A \nmanifesto for sharing engineering data’. \n1 \nOur manifesto describes a set of principles \nto help increase access to data and \ndrive innovation across the engineering \nand built environment sectors. One year \non from the manifesto, it is time to put \nmore of these principles into practice. \nThis paper explores how the principles \nrelating to the sharing and stewardship \nof data might be put into practice. We do \nthis by exploring two built environment \nuse cases: smart buildings and digital \ntwins, but there are other examples that \ncould be drawn from across the sector.\nTo set the scene we explore how other \nsectors are adapting to use data well and \nreview several approaches for increasing \naccess to data while mitigating potential \nharmful impacts from its use. These \napproaches include the creation of \ndata institutions – organisations whose \npurpose involves stewarding data on \nbehalf of others, often towards public, \neducational or charitable aims. \n2\n\n6 Open Data Institute | March 2021 | WhitepaperExploring new approaches for sharing data in the built environment\nUnlocking the value of data \nfor the built environment\nWe unlock value from data when it is used. Data needs \nto be shared and published in ways that build trust \nand ensure it is used ethically, legally and securely.\n3\nBuilding a shared vision for using data \nwell requires a common understanding \nof not just the benefits of sharing \ndata, but also the infrastructure and \ngovernance needed to support its use.\nA first step is recognising that \ndata exists on a spectrum, from \nclosed, shared to open. \n•Open data is data that is available for\nanyone to access, use and share. It is\npublished under an open licence that\nallows it to be used for any purpose.\n•Shared data is data that is only\navailable to certain people or\ngroups, such as researchers. Data\nthat is shared will typically be made\navailable for specific purposes that\nare defined by, for example, a data-\nsharing agreement. There are many\nways in which data can be made\naccessible, or ‘shared’, with others. \n4\n•Closed data is data that is held\nprivately within an organisation,\nsuch as employment contracts,\npolicies or sales reports.\n•Diagram 1 shows how data from\nthe energy sector would be\napplied to the Data Spectrum.\nBy making data as open as possible – \nwhile protecting privacy, commercial \nconfidentiality and national security \n– we can unlock more value from it.\nOur research into the benefits of sharing \ndata in the private sector \n5\n found that \nsharing data – between suppliers, \npartners and with customers – creates \nnew opportunities, increases revenue, \nreduces direct costs and improves \nefficiency in operations. In addition to \ndirect benefits for individual organisations, \ndata can also be used to solve a range \nof economic and social challenges, for \nexample helping businesses adapt to a \nchanging climate or responding to the \ncoronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic.\n3.

Our data \ninfrastructure consists of shared data \nassets, the standards and technologies that \nenable its use, the policies and guidance \nthat inform how data is used and managed \nand the organisations that govern it \n9\n.\nData infrastructure needs to be maintained \nin the same way that our physical \ninfrastructure also needs to be maintained. \nTo ensure sustainable access to data and \nto help unlock value over the long term, \nour regional, national and international \ndata infrastructure will need to be planned, \ninvested in and strengthened over time.\nDiagram 1 The ODI Data Spectrum: Energy \n6\n\n8 Open Data Institute | March 2021 | WhitepaperExploring new approaches for sharing data in the built environment\nInsights from other sectors\nData and digital transformations are driving changes \nacross all sectors, not just the built environment. There \nare many examples of how adopting open, collaborative \napproaches are helping to tackle social, environmental \nand economic challenges through sharing data. \nSo how are other sectors working together \nto understand how to share data and \nbuild the necessary data infrastructure \nand institutions to govern it?\nFor insights, we briefly look at how both \nthe banking and agriculture sectors have \nbeen responding to the opportunities \npresented by increasing access to data. \nThese examples highlight the importance \nof finding the right combination of sharing \nmodels, governance and collaborative \napproaches that will help to tackle \nchallenges in the built environment.\nOpen banking – using data and \nstandards to drive innovation\nFollowing its investigation into competition \nin UK banking, the Competition and \nMarkets Authority (CMA) mandated the \nUK’s largest banks to launch the Open \nBanking initiative, whose aim is to ‘stimulate \ninnovation across the financial sector,  \nto enable the “unbundling” of complex  \nretail banking products (in particular \npersonal and business current \naccounts) and to ultimately lead to \ngreater competition overall.’ \n10\nThe Open Banking Working Group was \nset up in 2015 for two primary purposes. \nFirstly to explore how data could be \nused to help people to transact, save, \nborrow, lend and invest their money, and \nthus improve their banking experience. \nAnd secondly, to begin development \nof the necessary open standards \nthat would enable access to data. \nThe CMA determined there would need \nto be a central implementation \n11\n entity to \ndevelop the standards, build the supporting \ninfrastructure and coordinate and drive \nimplementation. \n11\n So the Open Banking \nImplementation Entity (OBIE) was created \nto oversee the implementation of the \nregulation, work with the banks to design \nthe technical standard and to support \nadoption. To be successful, there needed \nto be an independent, trusted central \nentity to steward the standards, coordinate \nacross the sector and ultimately, drive \nchange. The creation of the Open Banking \nStandard guides how banking data should \nbe created, shared and used, facilitating \nthe move to openness, alongside specific \nchallenges to increase innovation. \nSpurred on by regulatory changes \nmentioned above, the banking sector is \nnow beginning to benefit from the adoption \nof a new standard for open banking. The \nability for a broader range of organisations \nto access data on banking products and \ncustomer transaction histories is leading \nto the creation of more innovative products \nand services. By granting trusted third \nparties access to data, customers can \nmore easily switch current accounts, gain \naccess to personal finance dashboards, \nas well as make more accurate loan \nand credit-referencing decisions. \n10.  State of Open Data (2019),  \n‘Data infrastructure’\n11.  ibid\n\nExploring new approaches for sharing data in the built environment\nOpen Data Institute | March 2021 | Whitepaper 9\nA recent review \n12\n of the impact of open \nbanking found that, while the initiative is \nstill early in its development, it has evolved \nto add value to customers and service \nproviders on broader financial management \nissues, as well as delivering on its intended \npurpose: to stimulate innovation. The \nmodel initially adopted by the UK is now \nbeing replicated worldwide. The approach \nillustrates the role of regulation in shaping \ndata-access arrangements within a \nsector, the speed of data innovation \nonce the necessary data infrastructure \nis available, the ability for innovative \nmodels to spread to other countries \nand the importance of independent \nstewardship of both data and standards.\nAgriculture – using data to \nenable collaboration \nBy 2030, the agricultural productivity and \nincomes of small-scale food producers \nneed to double to achieve food security \nand promote sustainable agriculture \n13\n. The \nrapidly increasing availability of data has \nhuge potential to improve the agriculture \nsector and address food and nutrition \nchallenges. Supported by government \nfunding, a range of organisations across \nthe agriculture, nutrition and digital sectors \nare collaborating to increase access \nto data to address food security and \nnutrition challenges. Global Open Data for \nAgriculture and Nutrition (GODAN) Action \n14\n \nwas a three-year project that began in \n2017, to enable data producers, stewards \nand users to engage effectively with open \ndata and maximise its potential to bring \na positive impact in the agriculture and \nnutrition sectors. The project focused \non three key areas of work: standards, \nimpact and capacity building.\nEach partner organisation brings unique \nskills and experience to contribute to the \nproject, which has engaged many different \ngroups to improve understanding and use \nof open data – training over 1,000 data \nproducers, stewards and users around \nthe world. The project has created tools to \nfacilitate discovery and use of standards \nfor agricultural and geospatial data across \ndiverse communities of practice. It has \nalso made recommendations to improve \nthe discovery, interoperability and use \nof data across the sector. The GODAN \nAction project highlights how a range of \norganisations, working in collaboration, \ncan drive change across an industry and \ncan help to drive change, operating in a \nsimilar way to the ODI Peer Networks. \n15\n \nGODAN Action has led to the creation of \nnew data infrastructure, including shared-\ndata assets, standards and new institutions \nto manage and provide access to that data. \nOne example being the Africa Regional \nData Cube, which works to harness ‘the \nlatest Earth observation data and satellite \ntechnology to help Ghana, Kenya, Sierra \nLeone, Senegal and Tanzania address \nvarious issues relating to agriculture, food \nsecurity, deforestation, urbanization, water \naccess and more.’ \n16\n Coordinated action \nbetween a group of actors has resulted in \nan approach that is demand led, increases \ncapacity building and is sustainable, which \nwill help to deliver better decision making \nand progress towards achieving the UN \n2030 Sustainable Development Goals. \n17\n  \nThe GODAN Action programme benefited \nfrom having a strong emphasis on \ncollaboration to develop standards and \ncreate shared-data assets for the sector.\n12.

But they are becoming an \nimportant part of how we move data along \nthe data spectrum while preserving trust.\n1. The default model:  \ndata-sharing agreements\nThe typical model for sharing data \nbetween two organisations are data-\nsharing agreements. On the ODI Data \nSpectrum, data-sharing agreements are \ndefined as ‘named access’. These are \nlegal contracts that define a close, direct \nrelationship between organisations. \nThey define how data will be shared, \nthe purposes for which it will be used \nand the roles and responsibilities \nof the individual organisations.\nData-sharing agreements are used in a \nvariety of circumstances, such as to share \ndata with suppliers and partners. They \nare frequently used to enable sharing \nof data with researchers and startups \nas part of open-innovation models. \nThe Data Pitch challenge programme \nused data-sharing agreements to facilitate \nsharing of data between a variety of \norganisations to tackle a variety of \nchallenges \n21\n such as futureproofing retail \nsupply chains, smart manufacturing \nand innovative approaches to reduce \ntraffic congestion. The programme \nsuccessfully demonstrates how simple \ndata-sharing models can quickly unlock \nmore value from data, providing direct \nbenefits to individual organisations.\n18.

Coordinating access to data via \ndecentralised publishing initiatives\nData consumers often need access to \nthe same data, from multiple sources. \nNegotiating data-sharing agreements can \nbe time-consuming and costly. Lack of \ncoordination around how data is shared, \nleads to bespoke technical approaches that \nfurther increase costs and add friction.\nAn alternative approach are ‘decentralised \npublishing initiatives’. These are \nindustry-wide collaborations that involve \nmultiple organisations publishing or \nsharing data directly from their own \ninfrastructure, using open standards \nthat define how data is being accessed, \nused and shared within a standard legal \nframework or via an open licence.\nWe have documented 14 examples of \nthese types of initiative, which include \nprogrammes like Open Banking, \nOpenActive and OpenContracting. \n22\n \nNew initiatives like Icebreaker \nOne’s Open Energy project \n23\n are \nalso adopting this model. \nThis decentralised approach addresses \nsome of the issues with simple data-sharing \nagreements by defining a standard model \nfor accessing, using and sharing specific \ntypes of data across a sector or industry.\nThe work of developing the open \nstandard, common legal frameworks \nand shared tools and technology can \nbe undertaken by a group of parties or \na single data institution, to coordinate \nthe cross-sector collaboration.\nStrengths of decentralised publishing \ninitiatives include that:\nWeaknesses of decentralised \npublishing initiatives include that:\n•    organisations retain stewardship of data\n•    collaborative approaches build \nrelationships across a sector\n•      the potential for lock-ins is reduced \ndue to the use of open standards \nand common legal frameworks\n•      they are applicable to a wide \nvariety of use cases across sectors, \ngeographies and data types.\n•      additional effort and investment \nis required to drive creation and \nadoption of open standards\n•      data consumers may still need \nto find and integrate a large \nnumber of data providers\n•      data stewards are required to create \ntheir own infrastructure to support \nsharing and publishing of data.\n22.

Icebreaker  One, ‘Introducing \nOpen Energy’ \n\nExploring new approaches for sharing data in the built environment\nOpen Data Institute | March 2021 | Whitepaper 13\n3. Data pooling\nDecentralised publishing of data can help \nto reshape how data is shared across \nsectors through the use of open standards, \nbut sometimes it is necessary to aggregate \ndata to unlock its value. Pooling of data \nfrom multiple sources can help to create a \ncritical mass of data that can be analysed \nto create insights that are impossible for \nindividual organisations to do themselves.\nBenchmarking – the sharing of data \nand metrics across an organisation or \nsector to compare performance – is a \ncommon example. By sharing data with \na central body it becomes possible to \ncompare data on operations, performance, \nfinances and a range of other indicators, \nincluding salaries, diversity and safety \npractices, allowing companies to \nbenchmark themselves and so make \nbetter decisions about how they operate.\nThese central bodies are data institutions \nthat act as a trusted intermediary, \nproviding the necessary oversight and \ngovernance around the shared data, \nenabling those contributing to the pool of \ndata to trust that it will only be accessed, \nused and shared in agreed ways.\nHiLo, a data institution in the maritime \nsector, supports sharing of safety and \naccident data across the sector. By \nanalysing the aggregated data it is able to \nprovide individual insights to the companies \ncontributing data. HiLo has helped to save \nlives and money: to date it has reduced \nlifeboat accidents by 72%, engine-room \nfires by 65% and bunker spills by 25%. \n24\nThe UK Geospatial Commission’s \nNational Underground Asset Register \n25\n \nis another example of data pooling for \nthe benefit of shared infrastructure.

This includes data \nfrom an increasingly diverse range of sources, not \njust energy or water usage, but observations from wifi \naccess points, bluetooth beacons, cameras, lighting \nsystems, air quality sensors and door locks.\nWho might benefit from increased \naccess to data and how?\nBetter access to and use of data from smart \nbuildings would have significant benefit for \nproperty managers and  \nbuilding occupants. \nFor example, ‘data collected by motion \nand occupancy sensors at a building level \n[can be used] to regulate air-conditioning \nand lighting in real time, thereby reducing \nenergy costs and optimizing the internal \nenvironment for its intended purpose.’ \n27\n \nAt the White Collar Factory in Shoreditch, \nLondon, metering is ‘implemented at a \nvery detailed level and is expected to \nprovide valuable information on how \nthe building performs in practice.’ \n28\n \nThe data can also lead to more efficient \nbuilding maintenance, as ‘the continuous \nmonitoring and predictive capability of \nInternet of Things (IoT)-enabled buildings \ncan also preempt a repair or maintenance \nissue by enabling a building manager to \ntake appropriate corrective action before \ntenants even notice a problem.’ \n29\nArup has also been researching the benefit \nof smart buildings during the coronavirus \npandemic, theorising that ‘on-site \nassessments, computational modelling \nand simulations can quickly identify high-\nrisk areas, such as poor ventilation. \nThis allows operators to recognise the \nsources of pollution and optimises the \nbuilding’s operation and management.’ \n30\nIncreasing access to data can also \nsupport other stakeholders:\n• Tenants might be offered more control \nover lighting, heating and ventilation, \nas well as better services, for example, \noffering more flexible spaces and \neasier interactions with spaces such \nas booking meeting rooms, personal \nroom temperatures and customisable \nfood and beverage options.\n• CEOs and COOs may be able to better \nunderstand their building use and \nconnected environmental impacts, \nallowing them to reduce their carbon \nfootprint and save on capital costs.\n• Researchers could use data to evaluate \nand compare building performance. \nThey could also use this to monitor any \neffect that the proliferation of smart \nbuildings has on meeting energy reduction \ntargets and hold organisations in poor-\nperforming buildings to account. \n• With access to standardised data and \ninterfaces, startups might offer new \ntools, products and services utilising \nthe data generated by smart buildings.\n2 7.

Are office blocks an \nefficient use of capital resources for an \norganisation? Has the coronavirus pandemic \nchanged our reliance on office space? If \nwe have offices, where should they be: city \ncentre, business parks or suburbs? What \nimpact do they have on the environment \nand on the community around the sites? \nWhere are the challenges in sharing  \nand using this data?\nCurrently, in the UK, data from smart \nbuildings is siloed. This begins during design \nand construction, when digital plans are \nhanded between multiple organisations \nover the early lifecycle of the building. \nThese silos continue once the building \nis occupied and functional – leading to \nfragmentation across data platforms, services \nand infrastructure across the sector. As \nArup commented: ‘Too often buildings’ IT \npackages are more of an after-thought, \nsomething to fit in, not an opportunity \nto be seized.’ \n31\n For the promise of smart \nbuildings to be realised, these vertical silos \nmust be broken down so that data can \nbe accessed and shared more easily.\nThe increasing amount of data that is used \nto monitor buildings and workplaces also \nraises potential ethical and privacy concerns. \nData from smart offices could be designed \nor repurposed as a form of workplace \nsurveillance, \n32\n leading to harmful impacts \nfor workers. Increased use of data in offices \ncould ‘potentially [result] in the disclosure of \ndata that people might not feel comfortable \ndisclosing (such as where they go, what \nthey do, when and with whom they spend \ntime, whether they are healthy and more)’. \n33\nUnderstanding and addressing such ethical \nand privacy issues within smart buildings are \nvital. It would be hasty to roll out experimental \ntechnologies, such as the IoT and sensors, \nwithout understanding the potential negative \naspects on people and the environment.\nWhile there are potential benefits from \nusing data to reduce carbon footprints, \nthere is a need for a balanced approach \nto data collection and use. Not only do \nthe environmental impact of the additional \nsensors need to be factored in, but also the \nongoing financial and environmental costs of \nstoring the data in servers, which worldwide, \nhas a significant impact on the environment. \n34\n \nWhere could new data-access \napproaches help?\nAddressing the above challenges requires \nthe creation of a stronger, more-open \ndata infrastructure for smart buildings. \nThis infrastructure will be based on \nopen standards and clear policies and \nguidance that will clarify the rights and \nresponsibilities around how data is \nbeing collected, used and shared.\nA new data-access approach could bring \nbenefits, for example to benchmark data for \nthe sector. A new set of initiatives could help \nto coordinate the creation and adoption of \nopen standards – to help to standardise how \ndata is being accessed, used and shared \nbetween different systems, services and \nbuildings throughout a building’s lifecycle. \nThese standards should be developed in the \nopen, mirroring the standards development in \nOpen Banking and Open Energy and learning \nfrom collaborative initiatives to manage \ninfrastructure such as Project 13. BDNS \n(Building Device Naming Standard), for the \nnaming of data producing devices such as \nsensors or lights, is the first of these initiatives \ntowards creating ‘Open Property’ in a similar \nway. Once the data is standardised, it can \nbe pooled from various sources, allowing \ncomparison of the performances of buildings \nacross a number of metrics, including \noccupancy, environmental efficiency, \nfinances and safety. This organisation could \nperform a similar role that HiLo does in the \nmaritime sector, leading to more efficient, \nsafer and healthier buildings. Whether a data \ninstitution is the right fit for this problem will \nrequire further analysis, but the cases of \nOpen Banking, HiLo and Project 13 should \nprovide an idea of how it could operate. \nA data institution could also act as an \nindependent steward of data to assist in \naddressing the ethical and privacy concerns \naround data from smart buildings. Data \ninstitutions offer potential to provide \nstrong, participatory governance around \ndata, involving owners, operators, tenants \nand workers in decision making.\n31.

It is important to \nemphasise that ‘digital twins are a methodology, not a \ntechnology. It is an approach and way of working,  \nenabled by connecting the physical and digital worlds’.\n35\nThe Centre for Digital Built Britain (CDBB) \nand the Digital Framework Task Group \ndeveloped the Gemini Principles, \n36\n to \narticulate a set of proposed principles \nto guide the creation of stronger data \ninfrastructure for the built environment. \nThe principles are organised under three \noverarching themes: purpose, trust and \nfunction and are intended to create \nalignment in the industry, stress the \nbenefits of sharing data for the public good \nand provide a context within which key \nquestions can be identified and addressed.\nIncreased data sharing in the built \nenvironment sector has the potential to \npositively impact multiple parts of society. \nFor the economy, there are potential \nimprovements to national infrastructure \nproductivity, security and measurements \nof outcomes, alongside increases in \ncollaboration, innovation and safety. \nGreater data sharing in itself could release \nan additional £7bn per year of benefits \nacross the UK infrastructure sectors. \n37\nWho might benefit from increased \naccess to data and how?\nAccording to the CDBB, the National \nDigital Twin programme has the potential to \nbenefit society in a far greater way than any \nother investment in the built environment \nsector, \n38\n including everything from better \nhealth and wellness in office environments \nto improved air quality in our dense urban \nenvironments. \n39\n Digital twins will improve \ntransparency, create better outcomes \nfor the customer (often the public) and \ndeliver higher satisfaction to the user. \n• Local and national governments are \nbetter able to understand how different \nevents will impact their infrastructure.  \nA digital twins approach will create more \nuseful insights, enabling better decision \nmaking. For example, the ‘Breathing City’ \nproject is improving the wellbeing and \nsafety of urban populations and provides \nvaluable insights to educate society \non the impact of pollution through the \ncollection of environmental data to inform \na digital twin approach. \n40\n Pollution, traffic \nand footfall data are built upon geospatial \ndata to create a digital model of Leeds. \n35.

This is integrated \nwith water company infrastructure \ndata and complemented with dynamic \nweather data and environmental data \nsuch as traffic and air quality data \nto build a full picture of the city.\n• There are considerable benefits to \nbusinesses, through the creation of a \nnew market, improved efficiency to the \nentire value chain, reduced uncertainty \nand better risk management. For \nexample, engineers at General Electric \n& Rolls Royce use sensor data in their \nengines, to measure everything from \nthe temperature of the exhausts, to \nthe speed of the turbines to improve \nperformance. \n42\n Similar methods are \nused by NASA when building their space \nshuttles and in Formula One cars. \n• In a broader sense, a National Digital \nTwin will create less disruption and \nwaste, more reuse and better efficiency, \nall of which create environmental \nbenefits through a more circular \neconomy in the built environment. \nWhere are the challenges in \nsharing and using this data?\nTo build an effective digital twin approach, \na range of data is required and that data \nmust be shared openly across multiple \nsectors in a machine-readable format. \nAgreeing on standards, a common \nlanguage for different stakeholders \nacross different domains, takes time and \ncoordination and will impact the ability \nto connect twins, which may result in \nissues for owners of single assets, such \nas vendor lock-in and lack of evolution.\nRetrofitting ageing complex infrastructure \nwith the technology necessary for a digital \ntwins approach may be more difficult \nthan creating new physical, digital-ready \nassets from scratch, one example of \nwhich is wifi black spots in old buildings. \nPhysical infrastructure changes at a \nmuch slower pace than the worlds of \nsoftware and data. Integrating the two \nin an ecosystem of digital twins may be \nvery hard, slow and costly as a result.\nBuy-in to the digital twins approach will \nbe important. Some organisations may \nimplement overly complex, unnecessary \nsystems and lose faith in digital twins or \na critical mass could choose to stick with \ncurrent technologies rather than invest in \na digital twins approach. Asset owners \nneed to find the right level of complexity \nto aim for when developing twins; not all \ntwins need to involve real-time data at large \nvolumes and complex predictive models.\nWe can also look at digital twins not \nin isolation, but as data and models \nthat can be shared, connected and \nintegrated, creating a whole greater than \nthe sum of its parts, which has its own \nset of challenges. Data sharing between \norganisations is often done on an ad \nhoc basis, through data requests, hack \nevents and even email. This level of data \nsharing is not enough to organically \nsupport a set of connected twins.\nODI research \n43\n has highlighted a number \nof barriers to increasing access to data \nin the private sector, which touch on \na range of cultural, commercial, legal \nand technical barriers. There are high \nbarriers to entry in choosing a digital twins \napproach, due to the scale of digital twins \nprojects. Data infrastructure is created by \nmany partners who need to collaborate \non sharing data, requiring a level of \ntrust. ODI research \n44\n found that trust is a \ncrucial lever for increasing data sharing. \nTo share data openly, organisations will \nneed to trust the institutions they are \nsharing data with and data users need \nto know whether to use data from it.\n41.

These data libraries would \nbe stewarded on a sector-by-sector basis, \nas each sector will have a bespoke set of \nreference data. The UK is a sector-siloed \nnation and data sharing will be, at least \ninitially, more coherent within sectors \nthan across them. There are examples of \nthese organisations that already exist and \nare actively stewarding data for different \nsectors, such as Xoserve, \n46\n the Central \nData Service Provider for Great Britain’s \ngas market and Smart DCC, which has \n‘built and maintained the secure national \ninfrastructure that underpins the roll out \nof smart meters across Great Britain’. \n47\nCrucially, these libraries need to be \naligned around common standards to \nensure they are interoperable and reusable \nacross a larger connected ecosystem of \ndigital twins across sectors. Sharing data \nacross sectors is a prerequisite for the \nsuccess of digital twins. An organisation \nin each sector, charged with managing the \nrepository of shared data and associated \nmetadata, would provide a simple way \nof sharing and communicating between \nsectors. Some organisations are already \nmoving forward in this space, the Data and \nAnalytics Facility for National Infrastructure \n(DAFNI) \n48\n is building a platform that will \nsupport the development of essential \nUK infrastructure by providing a central \npoint for data, modelling and visualisation \nwith data from across sectors.\n45.

Solving \nthe biggest challenges requires sharing data not \njust within organisations, but between partners and \nacross sectors. This requires investment in the data \ninfrastructure that can help us to use data well.\nIt is not enough to focus on the purely \ntechnical aspects of data infrastructure, \nwe must also develop the policies \nand guidance that govern how data is \nbeing accessed, used and shared. This \nwill ensure equitable access to data \nand minimise harms from its use.\nIn this paper we have outlined three \napproaches for sharing data that are \nalready being successfully applied in other \nsectors. We have also briefly explored \nhow these approaches might apply to \nsupport the operations of smart buildings \nand delivering on the promise of digital \ntwins. Choosing the right approaches for \nsharing data and deciding on what data \ninfrastructure needs to be built depends on \nthe problems and challenges to be solved. \nSometimes, what is needed is a cross-\nsector initiative to develop open standards \nand support their adoption and use. In \nother cases, to pool data from multiple \norganisations or to manage shared data \nassets, what might be needed are new data \ninstitutions that can provide independent \nstewardship around that shared data.\nMore work is needed to understand the \nright mix of approaches for smart buildings, \ndigital twins and other areas of the built \nenvironment. What is common is the \nimportance of openness and collaboration.\nOur manifesto for sharing engineering \ndata provided a framework for thinking \nabout how to drive open, data-enabled \ninnovation in the built environment \nsector. But the next steps require more \npractical work. There is a need for pilots, \nprototypes and open innovation.\nThrough our data institutions programme, \n49\n \nwe look forward to working with our \nmembers, our partners like Arup and \nthe Lloyd’s Register Foundation to \nexplore how best to increase access \nto data in the built environment. \nIf you would like to endorse the \nmanifesto, share your insights from \napplying these principles or explore \nhow to scope or pilot data institutions \nthen get in touch at info@theodi.org.\n49.
