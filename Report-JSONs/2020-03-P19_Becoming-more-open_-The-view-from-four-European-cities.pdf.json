We found that it was widely felt that the language of ‘smart \ncities’ was little more than a marketing strategy and that the move towards speaking \nabout ‘open’, ‘digitised’, ‘citizen-centric’ and so on was proving to be more desirable, \nmeaningful and positive.  \n \nWe identified a number of European cities that have recently released strategies \nwhich emphasised the importance of open data, open culture and citizen \nengagement. To find out more, we interviewed representatives from organisations \nworking within four European cities – Amsterdam, Gdańsk, Hamburg and Helsinki – \nto understand their approach to ‘open’, what they have done so far and what they \nintend to do in the future. These interviews took place during August and September \n2019.  \n \nThis report consolidates what we learned from these interviews and offers insight into \nwhether these four cities are moving towards a more open future. In turn, we will \nconsider how cities are:  \n \n●changing how they define themselves  \n●embracing openness \n●developing their (open) data infrastructure \n●fostering innovation \n●encouraging the use of data within departments \n●accessing data held by the private sector \n●considering the ethical implications of their use of data and technology. \n \nThis report contains a number of insights into how these four cities have become \nmore open, which will be relevant to cities of all sizes.  \n \nWe hope the words of the five individuals we interviewed will help guide cities \ntowards a better and fairer future. Achieving this future will not be a smooth process – \nthere will be challenges, there will be projects that cannot deliver upon their desired \nimpact, there may be promises in strategies which go unfulfilled. But by adopting an \nopen culture and sharing lessons learned, cities around the world can help each other \nalong this journey.  \n \nThe movement of cities towards a more open future – where open data, open \ninnovation and civic engagement leads to the fairer and more effective use of \n1\n Open Data Institute (2019), ‘Smart cities are decades away: but open cities are cities are within reach’, \nhttps://theodi.org/article/smart-cities-are-decades-away-but-open-cities-are-in-reach/  \n \n \nOpen Data Institute 2020 / ReportBecoming more open: the view from four European cities   3 \n\n \ntechnology – is encouraging and we hope the progress continues. If we can \nchampion these cities, we hope we can stimulate others to follow.  \n  \n \nOpen Data Institute 2020 / ReportBecoming more open: the view from four European cities   4 \n\n \nIntroduction  \nCities, and their wider metropolitan areas, have a huge bearing on the functioning of \nglobal systems. By 2030, 60% of the world’s population are forecast to live in a city. \n2\nCities are often significant centres of culture, history, business and politics. \nMetropolitan areas of over one million inhabitants account for more than half of global \neconomic output.  \n3\n \nCity governments are responsible for managing an elaborate ecosystem of sectors \nand people – in transport, planning, energy, emergency services and more – while \nbalancing economic, political and societal pressures.  \n \nCities face a huge array of challenges such as:  \n \n●providing sufficient affordable housing  \n●stimulating business growth and innovation  \n●increasing jobs  \n●minimising the causes of climate change and mitigating the impacts  \n●reducing crime levels  \n●keeping the streets clean  \n●managing the transport systems. \n \nThis complexity is precisely what makes cities so appealing to technology vendors, \nsystems integrators and solution providers, who sell the idea that these problems can \nbe solved by the addition of technology to everyday services.  \nSmart cities and open cities  \nIn response to the pressure they are under, city governments are expanding their use \nof data to include movement of people, energy usage, crime statistics, infrastructure \nmonitoring, weather conditions, and more.  \n \nThe collection, storage, analysis and use of this type of data is not new, but smart \ntechnologies – such as Internet of Things (IoT) sensors, apps or tech-enabled \nservices – enable it to happen at a far greater speed and scale than ever before.  \n \nAt the Open Data Institute (ODI) we advocate for, and support, an open culture. This \ninvolves data infrastructure that is as open as possible; encouraging data literacy and \ncapability for all, and advocating for open innovation. Underpinning these activities \nshould be a commitment to increasing the trustworthiness of cities to use technology. \nThis means:  \n \n●building ethical considerations into how data is collected, managed and used  \n●ensuring equity around who accesses, uses and benefits from data  \n●engaging widely with affected people and organisations.  \n2\n United Nations (2016), ‘The World’s Cities in 2016: Data Booklet’, \nhttps://www.un.org/en/development/desa/population/publications/pdf/urbanization/the_worlds_cities_in_2\n016_data_booklet.pdf \n3\n CityLab (2011), ‘Why Cities Matter’, ​https://www.citylab.com/design/2011/09/why-cities-matter/123/ \n \n \nOpen Data Institute 2020 / ReportBecoming more open: the view from four European cities   5 \n\n \nAt a time where criticism of the smart city movement is becoming more vocal, these \n4\napproaches could, and arguably should, be adopted by cities as a way of moving \naway from the strategy of smart first, towards one of open.  \n \nAs noted, the ‘smart city’ agenda was initially driven by technology companies. It \nthen became a major topic in the strategies, reports and commissions of political \norganisations, including the European Commission, the World Economic Forum and \n5\nthe Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN). City governments have \n6\nsubsequently adopted the language and have begun to develop strategies based on \nthe context of ‘smart’, with many seeking to be acknowledged as the ‘smartest’ city \nin the world. \nThe European Commission \nIn order to work from a definition that we could measure cities by, we looked to the \nwork of the European Commission, notably the work of the European Innovation \nPartnership on Smart Cities and Communities. In their Strategic Implementation Plan \n2013 they outlined a ‘smart city’ as an environment with:  \n7\n \n●sustainable urban mobility  \n●sustainable districts  \n●built environment and integrated infrastructures and processes across \nenergy, information and communications technology (ICT), and transport. \n \nThese requirements were not solely about technology or smartness. In fact, an \nintegral part of this view of smart was that “citizens must... be at the heart of the \nsolution”.  \n \nFurthermore, the plan outlined the role of data, and indeed openness of data, as \nintegral to the good design and implementation of a smart city. It stated that “relevant \ndata from public and private sources should be considered ‘open by default’” and \nthat “a focus should be put on building applications with a clear added value to \ncitizen [sic] to make good use of this data”.  \nThe Lighthouse Programme \nThe Lighthouse Programme was used as the practical vehicle for this agenda. The \n8\nprogramme funded 14 ‘Lighthouse Projects’, with 40 ‘Lighthouse Cities’ and 50 \n‘Fellow Cities’. It was hoped that this approach would enable testbeds for innovative \napproaches in areas such as transport and mobility, energy and environment, and \nhousing, to be tested in the Lighthouse Cities before attempts were made to replicate \nthem in the Follower Cities.  \n \nThis approach was based on the thinking that cities “are all alike in terms of their \npolitical economy, culture and governance”. But in reality, cities are complex; they \n9\n4\n Open Data Institute (2019), ‘Smart cities are decades away: but open cities are within reach’, \nhttps://theodi.org/article/smart-cities-are-decades-away-but-open-cities-are-in-reach/  \n5\n World Economic Forum (2019), ‘Unprecedented Global Alliance for Smart City Technology Launched to Counter Growing Tensions’, \nhttps://www.weforum.org/press/2019/10/unprecedented-global-alliance-for-smart-city-technology-launched-to-counter-growing-tensions/  \n6\n Association of South-East Asian Nations, ‘ASEAN Smart Cities Network’, ​https://asean.org/asean/asean-smart-cities-network/  \n7\nEuropeanInnovationPartnershiponSmartCitiesandCommunities(2017),‘StrategicImplementation            \nPlan’, ​https://eu-smartcities.eu/sites/eu-smartcities.eu/files/2017-09/SIP.pdf  \n8\n European Commission, ‘Horizon 2020: Smart Cities & Communities’, \nhttps://ec.europa.eu/inea/en/horizon-2020/smart-cities-communities \n9\n Rob Kitchin (2015), ‘Data-Driven Networked Urbanism’, ​https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2641802  \n \n \nOpen Data Institute 2020 / ReportBecoming more open: the view from four European cities   6 \n\n \ndiffer in terms of people, culture, politics and history, which all influence what \napproaches are taken and how decisions are made. The process of tackling issues \ntherefore will differ from city to city.  \n \nWhile marketing has encouraged widespread enthusiasm and adoption of ‘smart city’ \nlanguage, the actual impact appears to be minimal. When looking further than \nindividual projects using ‘smart city’ branding to denote the use of data and \ntechnology (which is not the revolution promised by smart cities), it can be seen that \nlarge-scale implementations, such as Sidewalk Labs in Toronto or Songdo in South \nKorea, are plagued by empty neighbourhoods, complaints of mass surveillance, or \n1011\nthey are simply not being built at all. \n12\n  \n10\n CityLab (2018), ‘Sleepy in Songdo, Korea’s Smartest City’, \nhttps://www.citylab.com/life/2018/06/sleepy-in-songdo-koreas-smartest-city/561374/ \n11\n The Guardian (2019), ‘“Surveillance capitalism”: critic urges Toronto to abandon smart city project’, \nhttps://www.theguardian.com/cities/2019/jun/06/toronto-smart-city-google-project-privacy-concerns \n12\n BBC (2019), ‘India election 2019: Have 100 ‘smart cities’ been built?’, \nhttps://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-47025472 \n \n \nOpen Data Institute 2020 / ReportBecoming more open: the view from four European cities   7 \n\n \nBackground \nThe open cities project is part of the ODI’s three-year innovation programme, \n13\nfunded by Innovate UK.  \n \nAs part of the project, we wanted to understand why European cities have followed \ncertain paths over the past decade or so, and we wanted to explore which cities were \nactively championing and developing an open and trustworthy approach in the use of \ndata and technology. This period of desk research involved, among other things, \nreading a broad range of literature, as reflected in the bibliography (Annex 1). \n \nThe research has been concentrated on cities, but many of the findings can be \napplied to areas of all sizes. The benefits of using data and technology effectively and \nfairly should be felt by rural as well as urban areas.  \nWho we interviewed and why \nWe wanted to learn and understand the history, strategic approach, challenges and \nopportunities of an open culture in cities that are defining themselves as ‘open’. We \nalso wanted to interrogate whether the approach to open data had stretched beyond \nopening up datasets, to gaining access to data from the private sector, which may be \nof value to city governments and their decision making. \n \nWe interviewed key figures working in the city government or relevant open city \norganisations of four European cities: Amsterdam, Gdańsk, Hamburg and Helsinki. \nThere are other cities in Europe, and beyond, which are also championing the use of \nopen data and an open culture, including London, New York City, Barcelona, \nBatticaloa (Sri Lanka), Dhaka (Bangladesh) and Kathmandu (Nepal). \n14\n \nAmsterdam and Helsinki are typically regarded as two of the leading European cities \nin the technology space, and we believe their insight into establishing that position \n15\nprovides an interesting contrast to the rising cities; Hamburg and Gdańsk. The \napproaches to smart and open in these cities all started at different stages, and all \nhave different focuses, different pressures, different histories, and have made \ndifferent decisions. But they have all committed to being open or people-focused, \nwhich makes them all perfect candidates to highlight their journeys towards \nbecoming more open.  \n \nThe interviews provided great insight into how these particular city governments \nthink about being smart and open, how they have used data in public services, some \nof the challenges they have faced and some of their aims for the future. \n13\n Open Data Institute, ‘R&D: Open cities’, ​https://theodi.org/project/open-cities/  \n14\n World Bank (2014), ‘Planning an Open Cities mapping project’, \nhttps://www.worldbank.org/en/region/sar/publication/planning-open-cities-mapping-project \n15\n European Startup Initiative (2019), ‘Startup Heatmap’, \nhttp://startupsandplaces.com/shm2019-startup-city-brands-highways/  \n \n \nOpen Data Institute 2020 / ReportBecoming more open: the view from four European cities   8 \n\n \nCity profiles  \nAmsterdam \nGer Baron, Chief Technology Officer (CTO) at Amsterdam City Council \nWith a population of over 800,000 people, Amsterdam is the largest city in the \nNetherlands. The city council, made up of 45 members from 12 political parties who \nsit for four-year terms, determines the general policies of the city. \n16\n \nIn 2019, Amsterdam was ranked the third smartest city in the world, according to the \nIESE Cities in Motion Index.  \n17\n \nThe Amsterdam Smart City initiative “brings together proactive citizens, innovative \ncompanies, knowledge institutions and public authorities to shape the city of the \nfuture.” Since the initiative’s launch in 2009, there have been over 70 innovative \n18\nprojects.

The city council is made up of 34 people who sit for \nfour years. The council decides on local laws, budgets and plans.The elected mayor \n21\nof Gdańsk has been responsible for initiating activities, such as the city’s openness \npolicy. \n \nThe Gdańsk 2030 Plus Development Strategy was launched in 2015. One of the top \npriorities in the strategy is openness: “The openness of the process of selecting \nprojects for implementation, their hierarchy, and clear, public criteria of their selection \nunderlie the idea of an open city, which Gdańsk is beginning to become.

Its size makes \nit the eighth largest in the EU. The City Hall is the centre of both the local and state \ngovernments.  \n \nIn 2019, Hamburg was ranked at 34 on the IESE Cities in Motion Index. In 2014, a \n25\nMemorandum of Understanding (MoU) was signed with Cisco to become a ‘smart \ncity’. Hamburg participated in the MySMARTLife EU programme, alongside \n2627\nNantes and Helsinki.  \nHelsinki  \nHanna Niemi-Hugaerts, Program Director of IoT at Forum Virium Helsinki  \nPekka Koponen, Development Director at Forum Virium Helsinki  \nWith a population of around 650,000 people, Helsinki, the capital of Finland, is the \ncountry’s most populous city. The City Council has 85 permanent councillors, in \naddition to 85 deputy members. It is responsible for the strategy and organisation of \nthe city, as well as controlling the budget and local plans. \n28\n \nThe city has aspirations to be “the most functional city in the world”. This is \n29\nreflected in Helsinki’s placements in smart city rankings for 2019 – fifth by the Eden \nStrategy Institute and eighth in the IMD (International Institute for Management \n30\nDevelopment) Smart City Index. The European Commission ranked the \n31\nHelsinki-Uusimaa region as the most innovative region in the EU, with Finland being \nranked the second most innovative member state. This could be due to how, in \n32\nFinland, “Nokia created this mindset that we usually take quite a positive approach to \ntechnology”, according to Hanna Niemi-Hugaerts.  \n \nDuring our interview, Pekka Koponen discussed how the city government is \nempowered to make significant city-wide changes as it “is responsible for almost all \nof the services: education, kindergartens, healthcare, everything”. \n \nHelsinki is part of the ‘Finnish 6 Aika: Six City Strategy for sustainable urban \ndevelopment’, as well as participating in the EU-funded MySMARTLife, \n3334\n25\n IESE Business School, University of Navarra (2019), ‘IESE Cities in Motion Index’,  \nhttps://media.iese.edu/research/pdfs/ST-0509-E.pdf  \n26\n Hamburg Smart+Connected City (2014), ‘Hamburg and Cisco agree on Cooperation’,  \nhttps://www.hamburg.de/smart-city/4311574/cisco-english/  \n27\n MySMARTLife, ​https://www.mysmartlife.eu/ \n28\n City of Helsinki, ‘Helsinki City Council’, ​https://www.hel.fi/helsinki/en/administration/decision/council/ \n29\n City of Helsinki (2017), ‘The Most Functional City in the World – Helsinki City Strategy 2017–2021’, \nhttps://www.hel.fi/helsinki/en/administration/strategy/strategy/  \n30\n Eden Strategy Institute and ONG&ONG (OXD) (2019), ‘Top 50 – Smart City Governments’,  \nhttps://static1.squarespace.com/static/5b3c517fec4eb767a04e73ff/t/5b513c57aa4a99f62d168e60/153205\n0650562/Eden-OXD_Top+50+Smart+City+Governments.pdf  \n31\n ​ IMD World Competitiveness Center (2019), ‘IMD Smart City Index 2019’, \nhttps://www.imd.org/research-knowledge/reports/imd-smart-city-index-2019/  \n32\n European Commission (2019), ‘2019 Innovation Scoreboards: The innovation performance of the EU and \nits regions is increasing’, ​https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/IP_19_2991 \n33\n 6Aika, ‘What is 6Aika?’, ​https://6aika.fi/en/what-is-6aika/  \n \nOpen Data Institute 2020 / ReportBecoming more open: the view from four European cities   10 \n\n \nSynchronicity and CitySDK.

Forum Virium is “kind of a facilitator and catalyst for the city to \nget better services and for the companies that provide the innovation”. Forum Virium \ncan be a “bit faster to be able to get insight... and to hire people”; they can get the \n“first projects rolling and then the city has time to see if it makes sense”. If these \nprojects work, that’s great for the city, who can then adopt the services. But, “if it \ndoesn’t make sense...the city didn’t spend any resources”. \n  \n34\n MySMARTLife, ​https://www.mysmartlife.eu/  \n35\n SynchroniCity ​https://synchronicity-iot.eu/  \n36\n CitySDK ​https://www.citysdk.eu/  \n37\n New Statesman Tech (2019), ‘London and Helsinki CDOs sign digital declaration on smart cities and data ethics’ \nhttps://tech.newstatesman.com/it-leaders/london-and-helsinki-cdos-sign-digital-declaration-on-smart-cities-and-data-ethics  \n \n \nOpen Data Institute 2020 / ReportBecoming more open: the view from four European cities   11 \n\n \nHow cities define themselves \nis ever-changing \nThe academic Ben Green states in his 2019 book ​The Smart Enough City​ that: “The \nage of the ‘Smart City’ is upon us! It’s just that we don’t really know what that \nmeans.” We asked our interviewees whether they used the language of smart cities.  \n38\n \nGer Baron (CTO at Amsterdam City Council) explained that ‘smart cities’ was a term \nthat Amsterdam used back in 2008/09. He said that then it was “nothing more than a \nprogramme to create awareness about the impact that technology would have on \nsociety.” Since then, things have changed: “the whole idea around smart cities \nobviously has been taken away by a few corporates, putting in billions of a marketing \nbudget.” Sascha Tegtmeyer from Hamburg concurred: “I think that smart city is often \nused as advertising.” \n \nSascha described how in Hamburg they: “don’t talk about smart city... our strategy is \na digitalisation strategy. So we talk about a digital city, not the smart city.” An \nupdated digitalisation strategy for Hamburg is in process of being written, to \nemphasise that the focus is “about the digitalisation and optimisation of public \nservices”, and that this can be achieved partly through “good data management”, \nwhich is “essential for making new and good public services”. \n \nThis approach of digital as opposed to smart was emphasised by our interviewees \nfrom Helsinki as well. We heard from Pekka Koponen that “in Helsinki... open came \nfirst and smart came later”. Pekka’s colleague, Hanna Niemi-Hugaerts, told us that \n“the city is now busy with its digitalisation programme”.  \n \nGer Baron explained that smart cities are often seen as “put[ting] a sensor in \nsomething”, whereas a city focused on digitalisation “is about redesigning whole \nprocesses and the way we work and the way we manage stuff in a redesign \nprocess”. This has been focused on since 2018, as “when the city council was \nelected, one of the 12 most important topics they addressed was digitalisation.” \nShift to openness  \nWhile our interviewees distanced themselves from the language of ‘smart’, there was \nsignificant enthusiasm for the use of openness, digitalisation and citizen engagement \nas ways of talking about their city’s strategy. \n \nInterviewees indicated that there has been a concerted effort to foster an open \nculture through engaging with citizens, using and publishing open data, encouraging \nopen innovation, or developing the digital skills of citizens and government workers.  \n \nOpenness is not in itself new to cities. Many began the move to openness during the \nearly 2000s, following a push from citizens and governments to be more transparent. \n38\n Ben Green (2019), ‘The Smart Enough City’ ​https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/smart-enough-city  \n \n \nOpen Data Institute 2020 / ReportBecoming more open: the view from four European cities   12 \n\n \nAround this time, governments began to enforce freedom of information and access \nto government and public sector data.  \n39\n \nBy 2014, in Gdańsk, transparency had become a mainstream political issue that \nvoters cared about. Kris Garski told us that during that year’s elections, ”...one of the \nhot topics was openness of the City Hall. Is the City Hall open towards citizens? Is it \naccessible? Can citizens trust the City Hall?”. The open data programme, initiated by \nthe then Mayor Paweł Adamowicz, included a register of expenses and the decision \nto “publish the spendings we make as City Hall daily on the internet... so everybody \ncan check what we are spending money for.” This approach led to the city \ndeveloping an open data programme, which we were told also included citizen \nengagement, such as “development of district meetings... public consultation [and] \ncivic panels”.  \n \nCitizen initiatives in Hamburg led to the creation of a comprehensive Transparency \nLaw (‘Hamburgisches Transparenzgesetz’) – a cornerstone of the functioning of the \n40\ncity. The law requires the government to publish all public data openly, including \ngovernment decisions, statistics, contacts and geographic data. \n41\n \nThe law was proposed through Hamburg’s petition scheme, which allows residents \n42\nto propose ideas through petitions. The law and the push to open data up publicly \nhas had a lasting impact on Hamburg, according to Sascha Tegtmeyer: “We opened \nthis data to the public, but we also opened this data within the city. That was a big \nstep for us to be open, open to others, but also open to ourselves.” \n \nWe learned from Hanna and Pekka that Helsinki’s move to open stemmed in part \nfrom an event called ‘Restaurant Day’. The day was “a kind of guerilla thing” where \n43\n“four times a year, anybody can put up a pop-up restaurant and sell food from home, \nor in the parks... it was a citizen initiative, and then the city [which] is seen as very \nbureaucratic, embraced that at the same time... so there was a kind of a change for \nopenness, not only on data, but the city was kind of more willing to engage citizens”.  \n  \n39\n Proposals for a freedom of information law in the United Kingdom were published by the government in \n1997.

City governments that actively talk to citizens about the \nproblems they are facing, getting them to vote on potential solutions, and involving \nthem in decision making processes, appear to be taking the right steps towards the \nEuropean Commission’s requests (page 6). \n \nOur interviewees spoke about the emphasis on citizen engagement. Kris Garski in \nGdańsk said: “For us, openness is a part of smart city, and technology is also part of \nsmart city, but the most important is citizen engagement, and improving the quality of \nlife in Gdańsk.” \n \nHanna Niemi-Hugaerts said that in Helsinki “the city government itself, they’ve gone \nvery citizen centric” and this is being utilised throughout projects at Forum Virium, \nwhere “citizen engagement [and] co-creation is very much on the agenda”. In \npractice, Forum Virium “try to share what we are doing and make the agenda we are \nworking on more seen in the media. We use words and terminology that are more \neasy to approach for citizens”. It is important that city governments don’t overburden \ncitizens with technical jargon terms, but to use language that they can engage with.  \n \nThe importance of citizen engagement in Gdańsk was summarised by Kris Garski: \n“Most important is engaging people, and not just building solutions to build solutions, \nor building tools just for our [City Hall] purpose. What we would like is to build tools \nthat are used by people, or tools that make life in the city easier.” \n \nWhile our interviewees placed a lot of value on engaging citizens, their methods of \nhow differed widely.  \nPutting it into action \nResearch shows that many cities are struggling to put citizen engagement into \npractice. However, we heard that in Gdańsk, involving people in decision making \n44\nprocesses – through civic panels and participatory budgeting – “makes people feel \nvery responsible for every project in the streets”. Civic participatory budgeting has \nbeen used for the last five years or so, with around 15% of citizens (more than \n50,000) voting in this process. The City Hall has gradually increased the budget over \nthe years for the programme, from less than a million euros to €4.2m.  \n \n44\n Current Environmental Health Reports (2017), ‘Public and Stakeholder Engagement and the Built \nEnvironment: a Review’, ​https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40572-017-0159-7 \n \n \nOpen Data Institute 2020 / ReportBecoming more open: the view from four European cities   14 \n\n \nThis approach was pioneered in Brazil in the 1980s, and similar schemes have been \nutilised around Europe. In Paris, for example, 5% of the capital budget is allocated for \nthe residents to decide how to spend. It is also in place in major cities such as \n45\nLisbon, Cologne and Rome. \n46\n \nThe civic panels, championed by Gdańsk’s former Mayor Adamovicz in 2016, are \n“shaped in very close cooperation with local activists”. Over a few days in City Hall, a \nrepresentative 60 citizens – taken from the voting register – are invited to discuss the \nmost important city issues with staff from City Hall and topic experts. The aim of the \n47\nfirst panel was to discuss flood preparedness. Subsequent panels have discussed \n48\nair pollution, civic engagement and LGBTQ+ rights.  \n49\n \nBefore the meetings, the participants are provided with “all the resources... all the \ndocuments, our strategy and other resources we have” to maximise meaningful and \ninformed participation. These panels have, over time, become more inclusive by \nlowering the participation age to 16 and allowing temporary residents of Gdańsk to \nparticipate. \n \nIn Amsterdam, a suite of interactive open source tools has been developed to \n50\nencourage collaboration between residents and the municipality, under the heading \nof OpenStad (‘Open City’). This approach enables citizens, other departments, \n51\norganisations or cities to make use of them.  \n \nOne such tool is ‘De Stem Van’ (‘The Voice Of’), which gives citizens the ability to \n52\nupload ideas for the neighbourhood and create polls in order to determine support. \nThe plan with the most votes is automatically put on the agenda of the borough \ncouncil.  \n \nWhen new bike stations were needed in Hamburg, the public was asked where they \nshould be placed. There were 4,000 suggestions provided for new locations. Such \napproaches are helping the city authority test similar processes to explore the \ndevelopment of housing. City representatives engage the public with “all the \ninformation and data that the administration has... and we also give them tools to do \nthis at an event, or at home or online with a smartphone.” Previously, the city did \nmuch of this “without digital tools, but we are now trying to digitalise all of these \nparticipation processes”. Furthermore, they are “working on processes to analyse \nthis information in a better way.”  \n \nIn Helsinki’s first smart city district of Kalasatama, the city “managed to engage \ntwo-thirds of the citizens... in their workshops and co-creation sessions”. In \nJatkasaari, another of the smart districts, Forum Virium said they don’t want to \n45\n The Guardian (2019), ‘Pissoirs and public votes: how Paris embraced the participatory budget’, \nhttps://www.theguardian.com/cities/2019/oct/03/pissoirs-and-public-votes-how-paris-embraced-the-participatory-budget \n46\n Public Policy Institute for Wales (2017), ‘Participatory Budgeting: An Evidence Review’, \nhttp://ppiw.org.uk/files/2017/08/PPIW-report_participatory-budgeting-evidence-review_-July-2017-FINAL.pdf  \n47\n Medium (2017), ‘Civic Panel.

In Amsterdam, there is a “whole digital skills education programme, \nwhich is free and accessible for everybody”. The city council also funds “a few local \ninitiatives that help people in digital literacy [such as] for refugees”. The schemes are \nsmall – “only €20,000 per initiative” – but they are using them to “try to reach out to \npeople who are not in the library, who don’t look at our website, are not in the same \ntarget group that we always find”. \n  \n \nOpen Data Institute 2020 / ReportBecoming more open: the view from four European cities   16 \n\n \nHow cities use open \ndata and support a data \ninfrastructure  \nCities collect a wide range of data about people, businesses and services. The data is \ncollected primarily by city governments, but also by academic institutions, community \ngroups and private sector organisations. Data is collected through: \n \n●delivery of services  \n●embedded sensors in infrastructure  \n●research from statistics authorities. \n \nAs cities seek to embed more data capture technologies into public spaces, the data \ncollected is likely to increase. This data will be from across the data spectrum – from \nclosed, to shared, to open. It will have the power to help inform and make better \n53\ndecisions, but it must be done ethically and fairly, and with privacy, data protection \nand security firmly in place. This means considering any negative impacts and \nminimising them; being transparent with what data is being collected, for what \npurpose and by whom; and determining how and when it will be accessed, shared, \nstored and deleted. \n \nHanna Niemi-Hugaerts described Forum Virium’s IoT programme as “trying to ensure \nthat the city is creating or collecting the data that our future city services need”. This \ndata will be about everything from transport to movement of people, energy usage, \ncrime, infrastructure, weather and so on. The collection, storage, analysis and use of \nthis type of data is not new, but smart technologies (such as IoT sensors, apps or \ntech-enabled services) enable it to happen at a far greater speed and scale than ever \nbefore. The most important thing cities can do in this area is to understand what data \nis needed for what a city is trying to achieve. The focus should be on finding good \nquality data that is useful, rather than focusing on accumulation and big data.  \nOpen data \nOpen data is data that anyone can access, use and share. It can bring significant \n54\nvalue to cities, by helping to improve the efficiency of services, increase access to \nservices and lead to more evidence-based policymaking. It can also lead to \n55\ninnovation by bringing new and more diverse apps and services to citizens, \nbusinesses and authorities alike.  \n \n53\n Open Data Institute, ‘The Data Spectrum’, ​https://theodi.org/about-the-odi/the-data-spectrum/ \n54\n Open Data Institute (2017), ‘What is open data and why should we care?’, \nhttps://theodi.org/article/what-is-open-data-and-why-should-we-care/ \n55\n Open Data Institute (2018), ‘Using open data for public services’, \nhttps://theodi.org/article/using-open-data-for-public-services-report-2/  \n \n \nOpen Data Institute 2020 / ReportBecoming more open: the view from four European cities   17 \n\n \nOpen data portals act as platforms for anyone to access public data relating to the \ncity, region or state. All four of the cities we focused on have an open data portal, \nthese portals are: \n \n●Amsterdam: data.Amsterdam \n56\n●Gdańsk: Otwarty Gdańsk \n57\n●Hamburg: Transparenzportal Hamburg \n58\n●Helsinki: Helsinki Region Infoshare  \n59\n \nKris Garski in Gdańsk spoke of the difficulty in knowing what data to publish: “It is \nalways a question of demand and supply. So should we wait for people to request \nthe data and be open? Or should we make an effort on our own to open some data... \nbecause sometimes it takes a lot of money to open data and there is a risk that the \ndemand for it will be relatively small.”  \n \nFor example, geospatial and map data, which can bring huge value if made openly \navailable, enabling the calculation of efficient transport routes, support for planning of \nhomes and businesses, or for identifying areas of flooding risk, for example, is not \n60\nopenly available everywhere. We learned that in Poland the law prohibits providing \nfree access to “some geographical or map data, related to real estate... we have to \ntake money from people, even if we believe such a resource could be freely \navailable”. Kris Garski was well aware that this was a barrier to wider opportunity.  \n \nThis is why the principle of publishing with a purpose can bring such value. The Open \nData Charter described this reasoning in its 2018 strategy: “Rather than advocating \nfor governments to open up as much data as possible, as fast as possible, we \ndevelop practical guidance for government reformers to open up datasets in ways \nthat are most likely to yield specific and tangible benefits to citizens.” This purpose \n61\ncan be for transparency, to allow people to solve specific problems, or to boost \ninnovation. Part of being able to find this purpose is by ensuring that cities are in \nopen and receptive dialogue with the public and engage in open innovation so that \nproblems can be solved together – open data can support this.  \nAPIs \nOne method of accessing data is via the use of Application Programming Interfaces \n(APIs). An API is code which enables digital services to interact with each other and \nexchange data. APIs allow real-time access to data and therefore form the foundation \nof many services used frequently: weather apps, paying for products in online stores, \nintegrating maps into websites, and more.  \n \nAPIs “provide the foundations for digital services of the future”. They help to link \n62\ndata across different systems and improve interoperability. The success of journey \nplanning apps such as Citymapper would not be possible without APIs.  \n56\n data.Amsterdam, ​https://data.amsterdam.nl/  \n57\n Otwarty Gdańsk, ​https://www.gdansk.pl/otwarte-dane  \n58\n Transparenzportal Hamburg, ​http://transparenz.hamburg.de/open-data/  \n59\n Helsinki Region Infoshare, ​http://www.hri.fi/en/  \n60\n Open Data Institute (2019), ‘Using geospatial data: what you need to know about licences’, \nhttps://theodi.org/article/using-geospatial-data-what-you-need-to-know-about-licences/ \n61\n Open Data Charter  (2018), ‘Publishing with Purpose’, \nhttps://medium.com/@opendatacharter/publishing-with-purpose-introducing-our-2018-strategy-ddbf7ab46098 \n62\n European Data Portal (2017), ‘Open Smart City APIs’, \nhttps://www.europeandataportal.eu/en/news/open-smart-city-apis  \n \n \nOpen Data Institute 2020 / ReportBecoming more open: the view from four European cities   18 \n\n \n \nHelsinki is a leader in developing what Hanna referred to as an “API first approach \nwith a lot of service design for new services”. Forum Virium chair the CitySDK project,\n which aims to develop an open source API toolkit for cities around the world to \n63\nuse. \n64\nOpen source \nRather than being tied to lengthy and expensive contracts for proprietary software, \ncities are increasingly turning to software which is open source.  \n \nOpen source is code that is published under an open licence, allowing anyone to use, \nshare and improve the software. Using open source can help a city government save \nmoney, while building software from scratch or adapting code that has already been \npublished – such as from the open source code repository GitHub – can lead to \nbetter and more bespoke solutions.  \n \nBecause the open source code is published online, anyone with the right skills can \nview, test and audit it, enabling issues to be spotted, or suggestions for \nimprovements to be more collaborative. Fostering a community around open source \ndevelops the skills of the city and keeps the economic activity within it.  \n \nIn Helsinki, Hanna Niemi-Hugaerts told us that: “There’s a lot of open source \ndevelopment work going on... data platforms, data management, data content \nmanagement, and so forth.” \n \nKris Garski detailed how his team sees potential in an open source tool developed in \nMadrid for engaging with citizens. At Gdańsk City Hall, Kris said they are “researching \nthings like Consul, which was software developed by the City Hall of Madrid”.  \n65\n \nThe City Council in Amsterdam has gone one step further. In summer 2019, it \nofficially announced that for software “everything will be open... we’re going to build \n[it] ourselves”. While this will benefit Amsterdam first and foremost, in the long term it \nhas the potential to benefit other cities who will be able to adapt the software for their \nown use and particular needs and circumstances.  \nPutting data infrastructure into practice: mobility \nThe European Commission outlined mobility as one of the key requirements for the \nsmart city. The movement of people around a city is obviously a critical element of \nany city’s infrastructure. It is hugely complex; involving a range of different actors and \nchallenges, as different public and private companies are responsible for different \nmodes of transport. Open data has been shown to help. The oft-cited example of this \nis in London, where the provision of free, accurate, real-time open data by Transport \nfor London was found to help the city’s economy by up to £130m a year.  \n66\n \nOpen data can also help join up data from different sources so that cities can deliver \nbetter services to citizens. Cities recognise this potential.

Users see the length of journeys, what \ntransport to use (including suggestions on walking, buses, trains, taxis and dockless \nbikes) and prices.  \n \nIn all the cities we focused on, open data has been used to address mobility \nchallenges. Amsterdam has “all mobility data accessible as well via APIs, including \nparking, traffic etc”. Hamburg uses “live data for traffic and car parks”, which is also \nused by logistics organisations and some large navigation companies such as \nTomTom and Here.  \n \nKris Garski outlined further data linking opportunities for Gdansk: “If we just connect \nall of these data... from different sources, like from public administration and private \nsectors and data from transportation companies, data from telecommunication \ncompanies, we may get a lot of new insights on how residents of Gdańsk commute.” \nIn order to do this, it would be beneficial if non-personal data held by private sector \norganisations was published openly. \n \nIf cities know better how its citizens move around the city, they can make better \ndecisions; they can design roads and public transport better. They can also more \neasily understand the effects of changes to the transport system, such as roadworks \nor subway re-developments.  \n \nThe opportunity for the joining up of data from different mobility sources is perhaps \nbest exemplified by developments in Mobility as a Service (‘MaaS’). Seen as the \n‘Netflix of mobility’, MaaS platforms operate using a monthly subscription model \n69\nwhereby users pay a set fee for unlimited travel and booking for multiple forms of \ntransport, all from one app. This means that users pay for access to buses, trams, \ntubes, and sometimes bikes and taxis, using one account and one fee.  \n \nHelsinki has embraced this potential, mandating through law “that everybody who is \nselling tickets has to sell them through an API”. The use of the API allows the data to \nbe exchanged more easily between the various platforms and be consolidated into \none service. The benefits for users are clear: they get easier, quicker and often \ncheaper access to transport within their city. For cities, there is a potential for access \nto more complete data about door-to-door travel, which is very difficult with current \ntransport systems when buses, trains and taxis are operated by different \norganisations and are not booked through a common platform. In Helsinki, it has had \nthe effect of “kind of forcing them [transport providers] towards an open ecosystem”. \nMaaS is still in its infancy and has not been capable of demonstrating its economic \nsustainability as an idea as of yet.  \n67\n E-zigurat (2019), ‘Smart City Series: Smart City Hamburg — A Look Inside The Visionary Bottom-up \nInitiative’, ​https://www.e-zigurat.com/blog/en/smart-city-series-hamburg/ \n68\n Whim, ​https://whimapp.com/ \n69\n Helsinki Smart, ‘Whim’, ​https://helsinkismart.fi/portfolio-items/whim/ \n \nOpen Data Institute 2020 / ReportBecoming more open: the view from four European cities   20 \n\n \nPutting data infrastructure into practice: environment  \nSustainability and energy efficiency was another requirement outlined by the \nEuropean Commission. According to UN Habitat, cities are a “cause of and solution \nto” climate change.  \n70\n \nOur interviewees all referenced being involved in energy-related EU-funded projects, \nsuch as mySMARTLife and RUGGEDISED. These projects include activities such \n7172\nas smart home solutions, electric vehicle charging outputs and smart grids. They also \ninvolve ‘retrofitting’ certain areas, or zones within cities, with new forms of heating or \nenergy production. \n \nGdańsk participated as a follower city in the RUGGEDISED project. The goals of \nRUGGEDISED were to “demonstrate in total 32 innovative and integrated smart \nsolutions in the cross-section of energy, transport and ICT”. Gdańsk focused on \n73\noffering “activities complementary to building insulation, thermo-modernisation, and \nheat-network connections”.  \n74\n \nHelsinki and Hamburg participated in the mySMARTLife project, with the aim of \nmaking the cities “more environmentally friendly by reducing the CO2 emissions of \ncities and increasing the use of renewable energy sources”.  \n75\n \nAccording to Ger Baron, as part of the Energy Atlas project, data has begun to be \n76\nshared in Amsterdam about “rooftops, that would potentially be interesting for solar \npanels”. There is now “quite a bit of data being used”, in particular by “quite a few \nsmaller companies who actually sell solar panels to these houses, or companies”.  \n \nThe use of data in mobility may also encourage people to be more environmentally \naware about the modes of transport they use. According to Pekka Koponen, if people \nuse data enabled mobility services to move around, it could have “quite a large \nimpact for the city, if people don't own a car and the cars are not parked on the \nstreets”. Research suggests that moving away from a reliance on cars, when they are \nnot vital to someone’s livelihood, can boost the health of city residents and reduce a \ncity's emissions. \n77\n \nNot all environmental projects involve large technological deployment. Hanna \nNiemi-Hugaerts described how Forum Virium is testing “ready-made... home mobile \nsensor kits” that citizens can use to monitor the environment themselves. Around 350 \npeople have signed up to the project, which revolves around “smart flower pots in \ncommunity gardens”. Throughout the process, it has been “really hands on” and the \ncity has “ideate[d] together” alongside the participants.  \n \n70\n UN News (2019), ‘Cities: a “cause of and solution to” climate change’, ​https://news.un.org/en/story/2019/09/1046662 \n71\n MySMARTLife, ​https://www.mysmartlife.eu/mysmartlife/  \n72\n RUGGEDISED, ​https://ruggedised.eu/home/ \n73\n RUGGEDISED, ‘Smart Solutions Overview’, \nhttps://ruggedised.eu/smart-solutions/smart-solutions-overview/ \n74\n RUGGEDISED, ‘Gdańsk’, ​https://ruggedised.eu/cities/Gdańsk/ \n75\n MySMARTLife, ​https://www.mysmartlife.eu/mysmartlife/ \n76\n Opendatasoft (2017), ‘How Amsterdam Uses Urban Data to Build a More Sustainable City’, \nhttps://www.opendatasoft.com/blog/amsterdams-energy-atlas-using-urban-data-to-build-a-sustainable-city \n77\n BBC (2019), ‘What happens when a city bans cars from its streets?’, \nhttps://www.bbc.com/future/article/20191011-what-happens-when-a-city-bans-car-from-its-streets \n \n \nOpen Data Institute 2020 / ReportBecoming more open: the view from four European cities   21 \n\n \nThese projects in the field of mobility and energy offer a glimpse into how technology \nand data may be used to improve the environment in cities. Going forward, these \nprojects can help cities to adopt greener and more sustainable approaches to air \nquality and transportation. Furthermore, the opportunity for citizens to collaborate \nand collect data to aid these approaches is a positive and welcome approach to \ncollaborative open data.  \n  \n \nOpen Data Institute 2020 / ReportBecoming more open: the view from four European cities   22 \n\n \nHow cities foster open \ninnovation  \nOpen innovation involves sharing data and ideas, and supporting innovative projects \nfrom citizens, civic tech organisations, startups, and business or academia. For this \nto work, city governments need to share details about what problems they are facing, \nand equip citizens and organisations with the skills and resources to be able to solve \nthese problems. Activities which can aid and contribute to this include:  \n \n●providing shared and open data  \n●hosting events \n●running accelerators and challenges  \n●establishing specialist organisations  \n78\n●creating new centres and buildings for GovTech and startups  \n79\n●establishing partnerships  \n●running digital skills programmes.  \n \nHackathons are one example of open innovation and collaboration. They are short \nevents where programmers, entrepreneurs and public sector authorities gather to \ncollaborate on solving a problem. Often, the best proposals from these events are \ngranted funding to pursue their ideas further. Other similar models include \nco-creation events, accelerator programmes and crowdsourcing. \n80\n \nKris Garski detailed how Gdańsk City Council is “considering cooperation with other \npublic sector units and the private sector to take part in hackathons they are running \nto provide them with data and to promote our data”. He explained that they “would \nlike to see more and bigger engagement from the developer community”. He wants \npeople to: “come to us with ideas for new applications. And then if it is a sensible \nidea, we are ready to talk about opening new data in the city.” Sascha Tegtmeyer \nfrom Hamburg, where they use hackathons to help participants “realise their use \ncases with our data”, said that they use such events to “explain to people: here is our \nopen data – this is the data that might be useful for your use case”.  \n \nYet, Ger Baron in Amsterdam expressed that the short timescale of these events is \nnot always beneficial. He outlined that sustainability of the projects was key; \nsomething which wasn’t always appreciated: “Ideas are not the issue, but actually \nbuilding something that can be used is a bit more complicated.” In Amsterdam, there \nis an opportunity for “companies to create partnerships with us, so they get our data \nbut we also spend some time with them [doing] workshops on what they actually \nneed”, and establish whether any adjustments need to be made in the data so that \nthey can use it.

Supporting new business in this way can help to overcome some of \nthe barriers the ODI has identified that organisations could face when they attempt \n82\nto scale beyond an interesting pilot; including sustainable funding, and access to \nadvice and skills.  \n \nHanna Niemi-Hugaerts from Forum Virium said that there is the need to “have a line \nopen towards the [technical] community”. She suggested that “it’s good to start this \ncommunication as soon as possible – start at the planning stage”. For example, if \nForum Virium has an idea that is thought would be an effective service, they will ask \nrelevant technical individuals or organisations: “Hey, we might create this API, and \nthis is what we were planning. What would you need for it?” This engagement can \nhelp prevent time and money being wasted if Forum Virum has what they believe is a \ngood idea, only for “the developers [to] have some other needs”.  \n \nContinuous engagement with an enthusiastic ‘open’ community can result in a \nvirtuous cycle. According to Hanna, in Helsinki, when people within government \ndepartments “hear all these creative ideas this community is having, they get a lot \nmore motivation to work on getting the stuff open.” \n \nMultiple interviewees mentioned how important the Code for America movement – \ndescribed on the website as “a national alliance of community organizers, \ndevelopers, and designers that are putting technology to work in service of our local \ncommunities” – was for their city. Code for Poland and Code for Hamburg were \n838485\nboth set up following the success of Code for America. In Poland, Kris Garski told us \nthat the main aim was to “[build] a community between administration and \ndevelopers”. In Hamburg, they use the group “to explain our data [and] to hear what \ntheir needs are for our data platform”.  \n \nHelsinki formed a similar group – Helsinki Loves Developers – to engage directly \n86\nwith the people who want to use city data. This engagement can be meaningful for all \nparties involved, as skills and insights are shared between participants.  \nSchools, colleges and universities can also play a part in innovation in the city. Ger \nBaron spoke of the role of the Amsterdam Metropolitan Solutions Institute. Students \n87\nthere are given the opportunity to “use our data for a lot of their research.”  \n \nIn Gdańsk, Kris Garski told us about the encouragement of students to “play with the \ndata to try to build a solution”. Although no sustainable, commercial projects have \ncome out of this engagement with students, they saw it as “a very useful tool to \nsharpen [the students’] coding skills by coding with real data and build a better \nunderstanding of how the city works.”. \n  \n82\n Open Data Institute (2019), ‘Scaling data-enabled projects: a checklist’, \nhttps://theodi.org/article/scaling-data-enabled-projects-a-checklist/ \n83\n Code for America, ‘The Brigade Network’, ​https://brigade.codeforamerica.org/  \n84\n Code for Poland, ​https://codeforpoland.org/ \n85\n Code for Germany, ‘Hamburg’, ​https://codefor.de/hamburg/ \n86\n Helsinki Loves Developers, ​https://dev.hel.fi/ \n87\n Amsterdam Institute for Advanced Metropolitan Solutions, ​https://www.ams-institute.org/ \n \n \nOpen Data Institute 2020 / ReportBecoming more open: the view from four European cities   24 \n\n \nHow cities are encouraging \nthe use of data within city \ndepartments  \nFor cities to take advantage of innovative approaches to services, it is important they \novercome any internal issues.  \n \nFirst, cities already have access to a wealth of data, from official statistics to data \ncollected during the delivery of services. Ensuring it is used, shared and understood \nis critical.  \n \nUnlocking valuable, untapped data is an important and ongoing focus in the cities we \nfocused on. Our interviewees outlined the problem of data silos between city \ngovernment departments. In Gdańsk, the city took steps to begin breaking these silos \ndown. A “tour through the city hall departments” was conducted, which involved \n“talking with managers and talking with staff... [asking them] what data do you have? \nWho is responsible for it? Who is cooperating with the data you have? What could we \nopen?”. This provides a solid foundation for which to evaluate the benefits that new \ntechnologies or projects could bring – for example if they provide a source of useful \ndata that is not already collected.  \n \nBut, there is little point pursuing a revolutionary, tech-based agenda if the city staff \ndon’t trust the data, don’t have the skills to understand it, or don’t see the value in \ndata and technology. The ODI’s Data Skills Framework shows the range of skills \n88\nrequired to maximise value of data across an organisation such as a city authority. \nOur interviewees spoke of how, in their organisations, they are recognising a deficit in \ndata skills, and are trying to change it.  \nIn order to develop trust and belief in the use of data and technology, the Helsinki \ngovernment is to “start acting and doing even small things... set up a pilot and try \nsomething and learn”. Hanna Niemi-Hugaerts spoke about the value of focusing first \non “the internal benefits of getting data out there and open” so that you have “direct \nbenefits... as an organisation”. This means that it “doesn’t then feel as though you \nhave to add on so much, because you’ve already benefited yourself”. Starting small \nand demonstrating value can help get people on board with the change cities are \ntrying to achieve.  \n \nIn both Amsterdam and Helsinki, there has been a concerted effort over the last few \nyears to hire people with the right skills who can deliver on data-enabled change, \nsuch as coders, software developers and data analysts. In Amsterdam, the emphasis \nis now on hiring “people who understand software and coding”. This approach was \ntaken early on by Helsinki city government; they hired scores of coders and \ndevelopers at the beginning of their digitalisation journey, and have recently \n88\n The Open Data Institute (2019), ‘The 2019 Data Skills Framework’ \nhttps://theodi.org/article/open-data-skills-framework/ \n \n \nOpen Data Institute 2020 / ReportBecoming more open: the view from four European cities   25 \n\n \nexpanded their call to attract international tech talent to work in the city. Hiring staff \n89\nwith this expertise can help city governments to build things themselves, meaning \nthat expensive proprietary software does not need to be procured. \n \nThe balance then needs to be struck between hiring staff with the right technical skills \nto work alongside staff with more policy experience and understanding of how city \ngovernments operate. Cities should also be attempting to upskill those already \nworking within the authority, encouraging everyone to speak the same language.  \nIn Amsterdam, directors were sent on a course “where they got educated on data: \nwhat does it mean, what are the ethics behind it, what is the legislation behind it, \nwhat does GDPR [General Data Protection Regulation] mean”. Part of this was \nchanging the mindset so that they know that “this is not something you should switch \nto the data department, but is something that, as a director of a department, you are \nresponsible for these things yourself”. They are treating this as an “ongoing exercise” \nand are also now training the layer of managers below them in a similar manner. \n \nSpecialist positions such as Chief Digital Officers can also provide this leadership. \nHamburg’s Chief Digital Officer has a “working group that is all of the leaders of the \ndepartments and different ministries” that are “working good together”. If senior \nfigures recognise the value of data and advocate for the extensive use of technology \nand openness within their city, positive change will be easier to achieve.  \n  \n89\n Signals From Helsinki (2019), ‘Helsinki, World's First City as a Service Is Not Just a Joke – Attracts Over \n6,500 applications from +100 cities’, \nhttps://www.signalsfromhelsinki.fi/en/news/helsinki-worlds-first-city-service-not-just-joke-attracts-over-65\n00-applications-100-cities \n \n \nOpen Data Institute 2020 / ReportBecoming more open: the view from four European cities   26 \n\n \nHow cities are accessing \ndata held by private \norganisations  \nA city’s data infrastructure consists of data that is managed by public institutions \nsuch as housing and transport authorities, as well as data collected and held by the \nprivate sector organisations that operate within them. This includes data generated \nby businesses that work with the cities to deliver public services, as well as those that \nprovide services directly to their citizens, visitors and others. \n \nData that is currently held by a variety of private sector organisations, for example \nUber, Google, AirBnB, IoT sensor manufacturers, portal developers, dockless bike \nproviders or app creators, is often out of reach to city governments. This data could \nbe highly valuable in helping cities develop better services or make better decisions. \nAs access to privately held data is complex, some researchers who are keen to try \nand develop similar data have attempted to deploy alternative workarounds, such as \n“sending students to catch rides en masse, or signing up to drive themselves”.  \n90\n \nA paper by the Open Source Lab suggested that: “Data sharing between the public \nand private sector will play a critical role in helping transit agencies leverage future \ndisruptions in mobility induced by shared mobility services and be of even greater \nservice to their community by adapting to user needs, for example.” \n91\n \nIn general, our interviewees spoke of their desire to get access to data from \ncommercial and private sector organisations working within the city. We learned that \nthere are a range of potential uses of this type of data. The data, from Uber, Waze \nand Lyft for example, could assist in making decisions that could inform traffic \nplanning. Opening up or establishing shared access to this data could also help to \nstimulate innovation and promote competition – as the Helsinki mobility API has \ndemonstrated with the development of Whim. There may also be regulatory or \nenforcement reasons whereby access can bring benefits, such as ensuring rental \nproperties are not driving up property prices or circumventing rental laws in certain \nareas. \n92\n \nIn some cities, this data sharing is happening. Strava, the popular fitness activity \ntracking app, has developed Strava Metro in a bid to share more data with city \n93\ngovernments to improve the quality and safety of urban bike lanes. Through Uber \n94\n90\n WIRED (2018), ‘Dying to Know Uber's Secrets, Data-Hungry Cities Get Creative’, \nhttps://www.wired.com/story/uber-lyft-data-research-driver-pay/  \n91\n Open Source Lab (2019), ‘The Open Source Paradigm in the Digital Transformation — Enabling a Sustainable Future in \nMobility’,  \nhttps://opensourcelab.dfki.de/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/OpenSourceMobility_WhitePaper_March2019.pdf  \n92\n WIRED (2019), ‘Airbnb and New York City Reach a Truce on Home-Sharing Data’, \nhttps://www.wired.com/story/airbnb-new-york-city-reach-truce-on-home-sharing-data/  \n93\n Strava Metro, ​https://metro.strava.com/ \n94\n Curbed (2016), ‘How a fitness app for cyclists is reshaping city planning’, \nhttps://www.curbed.com/2016/9/2/12749686/cycling-city-planning-app-strava  \n \nOpen Data Institute 2020 / ReportBecoming more open: the view from four European cities   27 \n\n \nMovement, Uber is sharing anonymised trip data with city authority planning teams \n95\nto help them to understand the flow of traffic. These big companies can leverage data \naccess on favourable terms, for example being able to operate in a city, or for a wider \npublic benefit – as with Strava. In other cities, in the US in particular, regulatory power \nhas been used to compel access to data from scooter and electric bike companies. \n96\nBut such initiatives are still not the norm, and may only occur in some cities and not \nothers.  \n \nIn all four of the cities we focused on, there were discussions ongoing about ways \nand opportunities of gaining access to data private companies have acquired and are \nretaining.  \n \nThis is an area which the ODI is keen to see explored further. We want cities to be \nensuring equity around who accesses, uses and benefits from data. We know this is \nan area that much work needs to be done in, particularly in relation to building trust \nand ensuring that cities approach companies to share with specific projects in mind – \nat least to start with.  \n \nOne of the key barriers the private sector claims it faces is ensuring the trust of their \ncustomers. Our interviewee in Helsinki told us that the telecoms companies are \n“afraid of privacy and security and losing the customer trust”. Privacy and security of \npersonal data are of course critical, and data protection laws, including GDPR, are a \nfundamental part of that. But not all data relevant to city decision making needs to be \npersonal data; lots of data is what we refer to as ‘societal data’. Societal data is data \nwhich has traditionally been collected to help society make decisions for everyone \nabout everyone, as opposed to pinpointing individuals. It can include census data, \ndemographics, travel patterns and crime statistics, for example.  \n \nA recent project the ODI undertook with the RSA and Luminate revealed that if this \ndata is not used to re-identify people, and its use is explained, then people in the \nmain are happy for it to be collected, used and shared. Private sector organisations \n97\ncould therefore share non-personal data with cities going forward, in order to improve \ndecision making. This is also an opportunity for better communication with the public \nabout the types of data being collected and why.  \n \nA 2019 Bloomberg article discussed the issue of access to data while respecting \n98\nprivacy: “Privacy concerns are real, but that doesn’t mean companies should be able \nto prevent responsible access to their data... Better cities need better data — to \nprevent crashes, minimize traffic congestion and get people where they need to go \nefficiently. So the way to protect mobility data is not to let private companies keep it \nto themselves; it’s for cities to raise the bar on digital privacy, championing practices \nthat protect both citizens and the public interest.” \n \nGer Baron in Amsterdam is trying to work more closely with the private sector.

Now that they have “got some of the data, we are learning how \nwe can use it together with the city, how we can use that in transport, or traffic \nplanning and city planning”. This approach is one way of engaging with the private \nsector, but alternatives to using public money should be sought where possible. \n \nGer Baron indicated a similar concern and offered a couple of ideas as to how \ncompanies could improve engagement with cities. He indicated that he felt \ncompanies “have an image problem” and that improved sharing of data would “help \ntheir image”. Furthermore, he speculated that regulation in this area would come \n“within five years”, enabling cities access to private sector data and improved \ncollaboration.  \n \nAs with any use of data within cities, there is no singular approach that can act as a \nmodel for other cities to adopt. Instead, cities at the leading edge of developing \nmodes of access should continue their dialogue with the private sector, experiment \nincrementally and publicly share the successes and challenges from their work.  \n  \n \nOpen Data Institute 2020 / ReportBecoming more open: the view from four European cities   29 \n\n \nHow cities are acting \nethically with the use of data  \nEthics play a crucial role in the use of data and technology within cities, just as they \ndo within all facets of life. Citizens need to be able to trust that the government is \ngoing to use data securely, fairly and ethically. When misuse or exploitation of data is \nin the news, it is important that cities develop strong, transparent and ethical \napproaches to how citizens’ data is to be collected, used, shared and stored. As \nartificial intelligence (AI), algorithms and machine learning become the norm for \ndecision making, cities will need to be clear how their use is delivering a positive \nimpact and how negative impacts are minimised.  \n \nOur interviewees discussed their progress in adopting these principles. As a baseline, \nKris Garski asserted that in Gdańsk, “we protect the data of private citizens. It’s rule \nnumber one that we open only data which is not protected by law. So privacy is very \nprotected here”.  \n \nBut the ethical use of data goes beyond following laws, such as the EU’s GDPR, to \n99\nprotect privacy. In Amsterdam, Ger Baron said that technology must be “responsible” \nand “work for us and not against us”. Ger defined responsible technology as “open, \nauditable, transparent and doing something that actually contributes to people... \n[and] society”. To make this more practical, the city government has developed a \nmethodology, as part of the Tada project, “to discuss ethics and dilemmas” when \n100\nusing and combining data.  \n \nEnsuring that technology is responsible has resulted in certain projects being halted. \nGer Baron described how in Amsterdam they “developed some algorithms which the \ninput was people with a certain profile who would get an invite for a job interview”. \nThe intention was to get unemployed people into work for the same company for over \n12 months, but Ger outlined an issue with an algorithm, when it was revealed that it \nwas only flagging “people with a certain profile”. Rather than trying to fix the \nalgorithm or the datasets used, Ger described how they simply “decided that we're \nnot going to do this. So we want just people to do the matchmaking basically, we can \ntry to find ways to do this without discrimination”.  \n \nOther cities around the world are protecting data ethics through new rules and \nregulations. In San Francisco, the strong step was taken to ban facial recognition use \nby the police and other city agencies, citing the need to protect citizens from \npotential abuse.  \n101\n \nThe Chief Digital Officers from Helsinki and London signed a declaration which \nincluded exploration of ethical uses of data in smart cities.

Tools \nsuch as the ODI’s Data Ethics Canvas can help start this conversation by posing \n103\nquestions to ensure that the positive and negative impacts of a newly designed \nservice can be considered and discussed before they become a reality.  \n  \n \n103\n Open Data Institute (2019), ‘The Data Ethics Canvas’, ​https://theodi.org/article/data-ethics-canvas/ \n \n \nOpen Data Institute 2020 / ReportBecoming more open: the view from four European cities   31 \n\n \nConcluding thoughts: \nthe future of open cities \nand beyond \n \nSpeaking with representatives of these four cities gave us an opportunity to listen to, \nand learn from, their successes in moving towards a more open future. It also \nenabled us to better understand the challenges they faced. \nRefocus to addressing local challenges \nData and technology have great potential to be used by cities to make better \ndecisions and make the city work better for everyone. But this has to be a deliberate \nprocess – initiated through strategies and policy positions, with the focus on \ndelivering positive value through services.  \n \nRather than focusing on technology, the people we spoke to are seeking a range of \nother approaches: digitalisation, better and wider citizen engagement, APIs, improved \nuse of existing data and the publication of government data. These approaches are \nwelcome and we encourage the priority of openness.  \n \nMost important, however, is the need to focus on solving specific, local challenges \nusing data, and using openness and building trust as a means of doing that. By doing \nthis, cities can move away from the focus on technology and work towards making \nservices work for citizens, businesses and all communities. These services may be \nimproved by the use of technology, but the emphasis we feel should be on using data \nto increase engagement, improve decision making and deliver better services. A \nfocus on addressing specific problems can similarly help this re-prioritisation and \nmay get more meaningful results than being the most cutting edge or technically \ninnovative.  \nIncrease access to useful data from across the public and private \nsector \nThere are, however, a number of foundational issues that cities must get right. One of \nthe reasons the smart city vision is failing on its promises is that it focuses too much \non expensive high-tech ‘solutions’, without developing a strong underlying data \ninfrastructure and without upskilling staff to capitalise on it. The focus in the future \n104\nmust be on laying this groundwork.  \n \nFirst, cities already have access to a wealth of useful data that, if identified and \nunderstood, may help them achieve their goals. One problem we are aware of is that \ndata may languish within departments or organisations that are unaware that it could \nbenefit other departments or organisations more widely. Ecosystem mapping a city’s \n104\n New York Times (2019), ‘Opinion: I’m an Engineer, and I’m Not Buying Into “Smart” Cities’, \nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/16/opinion/smart-cities.html \n \n \nOpen Data Institute 2020 / ReportBecoming more open: the view from four European cities   32 \n\n \ndata to understand where data sits, where it can and does flow, and where blockages \nto data access or sharing may exist, is a critical process for any city to undertake. Not \nonly does this help determine existing data infrastructure, but it can aid the process \nof breaking down departmental silos. This alone can enable more value to be derived \nfrom useful data.  \nDevelop internal skills and motivation \nSecond, developing internal skills and capability is vital. Cities should look at how to \nimprove the digital capability of their departmental teams. This should be done first \nand foremost through upskilling the staff that are already working there, who already \nhave the knowledge of policy and services, but who could benefit from training in \ndata, technology and digital skills. Large city governments would be wise to follow \nHelsinki’s lead with an injection of highly skilled developers and coders.  \n \nThe belief that data, digital and technology can improve services must be held \nthroughout all levels of the cities’ organisation. Senior management needs to \nchampion their department or organisation’s use of data and technology. This can be \nformalised through schemes such as Hamburg’s Chief Digital Officer Council and the \nappointment of dedicated staff.  \nDevelop relationships between the private and public sectors to \nenable access to data \nThird, while we have learned that many cities are actively publishing data, making it \nopenly available and encouraging wider use, the same cannot be said of the private \nsector. When it comes to decision making within a city environment, data held by the \nprivate sector has the potential to help answer a wide range of valuable questions, \nimprove citizens’ lives and deliver better services. Without access to that data, many \nimportant and potentially urgent opportunities are being missed.  \n \nWe have learned that Forum Virium in Helsinki is buying data from the private sector, \nand this is also the case in local government in the United Kingdom. Rather than \nbeing required to use public money for this data, we would prefer to see better \nrelationships built between cities and the private sector, where specific questions to \nhelp address specific problems can be discussed and worked on collaboratively. \nThese partnerships should be strengthened by a belief in the equitable and \nsustainable access to data. City governments need to be able to access useful data \nsustainably, and relying on purchasing private sector data can push this access \ntowards long-term uncertainty.  \n \nFor cities to solve complex problems for the benefit of citizens, engagement with the \nprivate sector needs to be developed.  \nEngage with citizens and technical communities \nTapping into the collective knowledge of citizens and citizen groups can lead to \nbetter engagement, better decision making and better services that people want to \nuse.  \nEngagement can be done in various ways, such as through focus groups like in \nHamburg, using online platforms such as Decidim or Consul, or through citizen \npanels like in Gdańsk. To maximise the value of this engagement, citizens need to \n \nOpen Data Institute 2020 / ReportBecoming more open: the view from four European cities   33 \n\n \nfirstly understand the major issues around the use of data and technology – and cities \ncan support this through education and digital skills.  \n \nEngaging with skilled people and startups can help generate ideas for how a city can \nwork better. Running innovation events, supporting and incubating startups, and \npublishing data are just some of the ways cities have been encouraging this \ninnovation. When ideas are found to benefit the city, the government or other actors \nmust ensure that the projects can scale to benefit wider groups and become \nsustainable. \n105\nLearn from others \nAlthough cities are different in regards to their history, and their cultural, societal and \ngeographical make-up, this does not mean that cities cannot work together and learn \nfrom the challenges and successes each has. Our research has shown that they have \na lot in common, for example many are trying to tackle big issues such as the climate \nemergency and increasing citizens’ involvement in political decision making.  \n \nIn this politically challenging climate, cities can start by forming partnerships and \nexpanding relationships with one another. The London–Helsinki Chief Digital Officer \npartnership launched in 2019, the data twinning of cities such as the Data City \n106\nproject in Leeds and Lille, and large-scale participation in the Open and Agile \n107\nSmart Cities (OASC) network, offer glimpses into what these relationships can \n108\nentail.  \n \nBut these relationships should go further, cities should adhere to Forum Virium’s \nHanna Niemi-Huagerts’ rallying call: “don’t be afraid of copying things that work!”. \nWith open data and open source software, this is a lot easier. Cities can benefit from \na more open ecosystem by sharing data, source code, ideas, tips and guidance. \nCities can build on past work and support other cities to do the same. Being open \ncan bring cities closer to their citizens and businesses, and closer to other cities.  \nAnd finally... \n \nWe want to see the movement towards openness continue and for this report to \ngenerate some momentum for cities around the world to follow. We want to see cities \ntry and build a more open and trustworthy ecosystem. The use of data and \ntechnology within cities can have a positive impact for everyone, if it is done so in an \nequitable and ethical manner. We want this open and trustworthy future to be \ndelivered by cities through greater collaboration between cities and within city \ndepartments, less data hoarding from the public and private sector, and greater \nengagement with people, businesses and communities. And this positive should not \nremain in urban areas, but be replicated and adjusted to more rural areas too.  \n \n105\n Open Data Institute, ‘R&D: Scaling data innovation’, \nhttps://theodi.org/project/rd-scaling-data-innovation/ \n106\n New Statesman Tech (2019), ‘London and Helsinki CDOs sign digital declaration on smart cities and \ndata ethics’, \nhttps://tech.newstatesman.com/it-leaders/london-and-helsinki-cdos-sign-digital-declaration-on-smart-citie\ns-and-data-ethics  \n107\n Open Data Institute (2018), ‘The Data City in Leeds and Lille: measuring data \ninnovation’,​https://theodi.org/article/the-data-city-in-leeds-and-lille-measuring-data-innovation/ \n108\n Open and Agile Smart Cities, ​https://oascities.org/ \n \n \nOpen Data Institute 2020 / ReportBecoming more open: the view from four European cities   34 ","version":"1.10.100"}
