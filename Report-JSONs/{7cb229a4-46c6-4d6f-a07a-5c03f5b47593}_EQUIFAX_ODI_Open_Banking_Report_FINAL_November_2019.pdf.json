The ODI works with companies and \ngovernments to build an open, trustworthy data ecosystem, where people can \nmake better decisions using data and manage any harmful impacts.\n1\nEquifax is a global information solutions company that uses unique data, \ninnovative analytics, technology and industry expertise to power organisations and \nindividuals around the world by transforming knowledge into insights that help \nmake more informed business and personal decisions. Headquartered in Atlanta, \nGa., Equifax operates or has investments in 24 countries in North America, Central \nand South America, Europe and the Asia Pacific region. It is a member of Standard \n& Poor’s (S&P) 500® Index, and its common stock is traded on the New York Stock \nExchange (NYSE) under the symbol EFX.\n2\nWhat is Consent?\nThe Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) defines consent as “any freely given, \nspecific, informed and unambiguous indication of the data subject’s wishes \nby which he or she, by a statement or by a clear affirmative action, signifies \nagreement to the processing of personal data relating to him or her”.  Across the \nbanking and financial sectors, this generally refers to a customer allowing a third \nparty service provider access to data about them that is held by their bank or \nother financial institution.\nConsent is one of the core aspects underpinning the trusted data sharing system \nknown as Open Banking. \nOpen Banking allows retail banking customers to share account and transaction \ndata with trusted partners. This shared data is combined with openly published \nnon-personal data, such as lists of bank products and branch locations, to build \nuseful services for customers, FinTechs, and banks themselves.\n1\n Open Data Institute (2012), ‘The Open Data Institute’, theodi.org\n2\n Equifax (2019), ‘Company Profile’, https://www.equifax.com/about-equifax/company-profile\n1\nResearch carried out by the Open Data Institute for Equifax\nIntroduction                                                                                                                                                                1\nAbout Equifax and The ODI 1\nWhat is Consent? 1\nExecutive Summary 2\nResearch Methodology 4\nResearch Results 6\nSpecific Open Banking regulations 6\nHow consumers give consent 8\nRevoking consent 11\nRules and restrictions regarding consumer consent 12\nRules and restrictions regarding data use 13\nDuration of consent 15\nThe consequences of breaking the rules 16\nConclusion                                                                                                                                                                   18\nAppendix                                                                                                                                                                      19\nContributors 19\nInterview questions 20\nOther documents 20\n\nExecutive summary\nConsent is an invaluable aspect of a trustworthy and effective data ecosystem. Consent mechanisms can vary \nsubstantially from country to country. This happens for a variety of reasons, such as the type of organisation governing \nconsent, the social and legal context, the risks to individuals or different groups of people, or the technical landscape. \nLanguage can also impact how consent is treated, both in terms of different languages being interpreted differently \nacross borders, but even within the same language. In English alone, terms such as “consent”, “authorisation”, and \nsometimes even “authentication” can be used interchangeably, further frustrating comparison.\nDespite this, there are overarching similarities that can be discussed and compared across the boundaries set by \ngovernments and regulators, how consent is granted by consumers, how it is revoked, how long consent lasts, and the \npunishment for breaking the rules. Universally important aspects are that consent must be clear to customers, using \nlanguage like ‘informed’, ‘explicit’, ‘affirmative’. Most regimes also emphasise that consent must be ‘free’ or ‘voluntary’, \nand as easy to revoke as it is to give.\nThe specific rules of how consent operates, such as duration, restrictions, and punishments are far less universal. \nAcross our research we observed the time period for consent to range from 90 days in Europe, to one year in \nAustralia and New Zealand, with most countries not defining this crucial aspect at all. Restrictions tend to be informed \nby the privacy laws of the different countries, which like consent can be very idiosyncratic across cultures and legal \nlandscapes. The UK and Australia have built whitelists for their Open Banking regimes to control which organisations \ncan participate, while Mexico and New Zealand have been less restrictive in this. Punishments can range both within \nand across countries depending on the severity of the infraction. \nOpen Banking regimes often offer a dispute resolution mechanism to allow organisations to \nwork out solutions together\n. \nWhere the laws around consent have been broken, countries such as Japan and Mexico have been very explicit about \nrepercussions in the form of hundreds of thousands of dollars in fines and years of prison time.\nThe UK and Europe have been leaders in this space in recent years with the implementation of legislation across \nthe continent such as PSD2 and GDPR, and many countries look to them to understand what works well and what \ndoesn’t. Australia and New Zealand especially have been making progress, particularly leveraging the UK Open Banking \nStandard to inform consent due to cultural and economic similarities. Countries with dissimilar banking industries such \nas Mexico and Nigeria have also been pushing ahead with their own consent regimes via Open Banking initiatives, but \ntaking a more regionally appropriate approach.\nCreating an easy, open way to compare consent could be useful to the international banking community in many ways:\n•  Different initiatives around the world could learn from each other, share resources on best practises, and coordinate  \n   on implementation.\n•  Comparison and coordination could help with interoperability in financial services between countries, potentially   \n   boosting trade and giving customers more and better options.\n•  More public awareness and understanding of consent could increase public confidence in these new processes, and  \n   reduce potential misconceptions around concepts like “Open Banking”.\n•  More public confidence could support user adoption, increasing the number of people with access to the benefits of  \n   Open Banking.\n•  Getting consent right in the banking sector and creating a trustworthy data ecosystem could create a demand for \n  the same rigour in other sectors, and open up dialogue about consent and personal data across society in       \n  meaningful and informed ways.\n\nResearch methodology\nResearch carried out by the Open Data Institute on behalf of Equifax in Autumn 2019. The research methodology for \nthis paper employed both desk research and user research. Desk research was completed by analysing Open Banking \nand banking data portability initiatives, as well as data protection legislation from the following countries: \nUser research was conducted by interviewing regional experts in Open Banking and banking data portability across \nAustralia, Canada, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, Nigeria, Spain and the UK.

Open Banking \nis the term used for the functionality including and beyond PSD2 in the UK, and it is likely that it may take on different \nforms in different markets. This could also include the use of open Application Program Interfaces (APIs) - APIs that give \npublic availability to web services, the publishing of open data - data that anyone can access, use and share, and more. \nThe UK initially designed this initiative to increase competition in the retail banking sector by encouraging innovative \nsolutions powered through data sharing. \nOutside of the UK in Europe, PSD2 looms large as the regional regulatory regime. Though this is not always considered \nan Open Banking initiative, it embodies much of the same characteristics. PSD2 regulates payment services and \npayment service providers, and works alongside the Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA) to ensure the harmonisation \nof payment products, infrastructures and technical standards across Europe. The scheduled introduction of Strong \nCustomer Authentication (SCA) and Common and Secure Communication (CSC) in September bring new advances to \nthis regulation.\nAustralia\nAustralia has adapted the structure of Open Banking in the UK as part of the implementation of the \nConsumer Data Right (CDR). This will require a similar rules around secure APIs featured in the UK’s Open \nBanking, but for all CDR data. The difference in this is that the Consumer Data Right only begins with banking \ndata. The end game is to roll out a similar API-based data portability regime for personal data in other sectors \nas well, such as energy and telecommunications.\nMexico\nMexico plans to enforce many of the same aspects as the UK, such as APIs and the sharing of open, \naggregated and transactional data by financial services providers. However Mexico is taking an industry-led \nroute that is focussing on innovative products for consumers over increased competition as its goal. It will \nalso be allowing for premium APIs, APIs providing functionality which can be charged for by the financial \ninstitutes providing them, and will impose Open Banking on all financial institutions, not just the major ones.\nHong Kong\nHong Kong published their Open API Framework for the Hong Kong banking sector in 2018, setting out its \nintended approach to Open Banking. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has also allowed industry \nto set its own standards without making it a regulatory requirement and the first API for product information \nwas rolled out in early 2019.\nIndia\nIndia’s Open Banking is built in part on the authentication process in Aadhar, the country’s national identity \nplatform. India’s Unified Payment Interface (UPI) enables all bank account holders in the country to send \nand receive money from their smartphones without the need to enter bank account information or \nonline banking details. As of March 2019, UPI is used by 142 banks, accounting for just under 800 million \ntransactions a month with a combined value of US$19 billion.\nNew Zealand\nNew Zealand is developing its Open Banking framework by adapting \nmuch of the UK standard. This is being driven by the voluntary \ncooperation of the major players in the market under the stewardship \nof the local payments association, PaymentsNZ. Similar to the UK, New \nZealand’s pilot includes account information and payments, and will be \nexecuted under the guidance of its own Open Banking working group. \nUnlike the UK, which rolled out account information functionality \nbefore payments, PaymentsNZ plans to launch both up front, putting a \nhigher onus on having the proper consent model in place.\nJapan\nIn 2017, Japan passed the Amended Banking Act to introduce a \nregistration system for Third Party Service Providers (TPPs) and set \nthe framework for collaboration between banks and TPPs. The act \nencouraged banks to open their APIs by 2020, with 100 financial \ninstitutions using these APIs by the Olympics being an important \nnational goal. There have also been voluntary partnerships between \nfinancial institutions to launch digital payment initiatives. However, \nadoption by third parties has been low, in part because of the difficulty \nbanks and FinTechs have in negotiating contracts.\nCanada\nCanada created an Advisory Committee on Open Banking to review \npotential benefits of Open Banking. In June 2019, the Standing Senate \nCommittee on Banking, Trade and Commerce released its report \nentitled “Open Banking: What It Means For You”, which included a \nnumber of recommendations intended to lay the groundwork for the \nrollout of Open Banking in Canada.\nNigeria\nOpen Banking Nigeria (OBN) was launched in 2018 in a bid to drive \ninnovation and choice in the Nigerian banking sector. Its objective is to \nroll out open APIs and encourage banks and FinTechs to adopt open \nstandards for API implementation. Nigeria is creating a framework and \nthey hope to draft their own standard that will be more appropriate \nfor Nigeria and other countries in West Africa. OBN believes Open \nBanking will revolutionise the Nigerian banking sector and be a huge \nboost to the economy as a whole.\n7\n\n8\nHow consumers give consent\nAustralia\nRedirect model\nNew Zealand \nRedirect model - \nmust be explicit \nand informed \nCanada\nConsent principle \nstates that it requires \na reasonable \neffort to ensure \npurpose\nEU\nMust be explicit, \nfreely given, specific, \ninformed and \nunambiguously\nHong Kong\nConsent must be \nexpress and \nvoluntary\nIndia\nMust be \nexplicit\nJapan\nUnspecified - must \nstrive to avoid \nmisunderstandings or \nmisperceptions\nMalaysia\nRequired for \npersonal data but only \nexplicit consent’ for \nsensitive personal \ndata\nNigeria\nGive informed \nconsent\nUK\nRedirect model - \nmust be explicit and \ninformed \nUSA\nTreasury \nrecommends informed \nconsent for data \naccessed via screen \nscraping\nMexico\nUnspecified\nBrazil\nMust be free, \ninformed and \nunambiguous \nand for a given \npurpose\n“[In Nigeria], Consumers give informed consent when they are able to see the \ntype of data they will allow access to, how often or long the TPP would have \naccess, and are able to successfully authenticate against their bank’s system.”\n“In New Zealand, both API Providers (ASPSPs) and Third Parties \n(TPPs) are subject to the Privacy Act, which sets out how they \nmust collect, use and store personal information. Accordingly, \nconsent obligations sit with both the APSPs and the TPPs.”\nAs noted earlier, consent mechanisms can vary substantially from country to \ncountry, though there are some commonalities across them. In numerous consent \nenvironments, we see three key elements: consent being explicit, voluntary, and \nnot cumbersome. These three elements increase the likelihood of people being \nproperly informed when consenting their data, as it adds enough friction in the \nprocess to allow awareness, without overburdening someone with terms and \nconditions.\nOne form of consent we see in countries that already have an Open Banking \ninfrastructure, is the “redirect model”. In the UK this means that customers \ngive their consent to a Third Party Service Provider (TPP), but authenticate their \nconsent with their bank, allowing the customer to keep the identity credentials \nthat are used with their bank private. This model allows for a clear and simple way \nfor customers to provide consent to TPPs. It also exists across the EU via PSD2, \nwhich has its data protection foundation within GDPR. Meanwhile Australia, New \nZealand and Nigeria are rolling out consent in a similar fashion in their Open \nBanking initiatives as well. \nRedirect models defined by Open Banking initiatives are not the only way to give \nconsent. \nOther Open Banking initiatives use the consent models that are defined in data \nprotection laws that safeguard the rights of consumers around the collection, \nuse, and sharing of their data. Hong Kong’s Open APIs are governed by its data \nprotection laws requiring ‘express’ and ‘voluntary’ written consent. India uses \nRBI’s ‘master directions’ while its data protection is still in draft, which have similar \nrequirements. Other countries with similar practices include Brazil and Canada.\nSome consent regimes are less well-defined than others. For example Japan focuses \nmore on ensuring there is a fair process than defining what that process might \nbe. Key organisations in the US such as the Treasury and the CFPB recommend \ninformed consent for data accessed via screen scraping, but have not defined \nenforceable rules.\nMexico is currently in the process of implementing Open Banking, and though it \nplans to have explicit consent built into the model, the mechanisms to do so have \nnot yet been specified via the FinTech Law. \nIn Malaysia, like many other countries, there are distinctions between personal data \nand sensitive personal data. Financial data is classified as personal data which only \nrequires consent, unlike sensitive personal data which requires explicit content. \nAdédèjì Olówè, Trustee,\nOpen Banking Nigeria\nSteve Wiggins, Chief Executive,\nPaymentsNZ\n9\n\nUK Open Banking and Consent\nby Emma Steeley, CEO, AccountScore\nUK banking consumers for the first time have transparency, awareness and control over their data. The sharing of the \ndata ensures that the customer is well informed of what data is being accessed, by whom and on what terms, including \nthe frequency of access. \nUser experience has improved over a period of time and we have seen a significant increase in the completion rates of \nconsumers sharing their data throughout the year, especially with the launch of Open Banking’s Customer Experience \nGuidelines V3.1 with app-to-app redirection. \nOpen Banking stipulates that explicit consent is required in order to facilitate the sharing of bank transaction data.\nThe positives:\n•  Allows the customer to be in control of what data they share and when\n•  Provides the ability for a customer to revoke consent at any time\n•  Means organisations need to articulate clearly what data they are sharing and be clear about why  \n•  Creates a method by which companies and government organisations can work within data protection regulation \nThe negatives:\n•  Organisations which have broken down silos now face restrictions on how they can use data\n•  Consent management by definition requires a user interface for customers which may not be consistent with an   \n  organisation’s UI strategy or brand values\n•  Organisations may end up with multiple APIs to manage consent which could be confusing\n•  The entire consent model could make customers wary of sharing data where it is in their best interest\nConsent Management\nThe complexity for consumers comes into play when they are able to manage their consents. With the increasing \nvolumes of TPPs, that are now implementing a consent management platform in order to adhere to the Open Banking \nCustomer Experience Guidelines, the consumer may have multiple data shares through multiple organisations, which \nmay quickly become confusing.\nAccountScore believes that consumers wish to organise similar activities into single places in their digital lives.\nIn its simplest form, consent management requires: \n•  A list of data assets a consumer possesses;\n•  A list of organisations they share them with; and \n•  A graphical representation of the interactions which exist between them\nGlobal Consent\nBeing the first Open Banking implementation to go live across the globe has given the UK a distinct advantage. \nHowever, AccountScore believes that global consent is something that is not going away and that ultimately consumers \nwill want a single app where they can see and amend these interactions across all organisations, thus creating an easy \nto manage consent data vault.\nRevoking consent\nJust as important as the process to provide consent, the ability to revoke consent is a \nkey component of Open Banking. Open Banking in the UK and PSD2 have spearheaded \nthe importance of allowing customers to withdraw consent at any time. The mechanism \nfor this is through a permissions dashboard which can be accessed by the consumer \nthrough their bank, or increasingly at the TPP. \nAlthough there are still improvements ongoing regarding consents within Open \nBanking and PSD2, they are still widely looked to internationally, with other consent \nregimes following a similar model. New Zealand and Canada follow the PSD2 model of \ngoing through the customer’s Account Servicing Payment Service Provider (ASPSP) or \nfinancial institution directly to revoke consent. Australia has taken a slightly different \napproach by having the TPP be the gatekeeper of revoking consent.\nOther data landscapes are less specific around which organisation consent revocation \nshould go through, just that it should occur. Countries like Hong Kong, India, Japan, \nBrazil and Malaysia all have clearly written rules allowing for consent to be revoked, \nwith Brazil and Hong Kong going as far as to stipulate it can be at any time.\nMexico and Nigeria are yet to complete designing Open Banking, but plan on having \nconsent revocation at the forefront of their policies. The screen scraping regime of the \nUnited States is unclear but the CFPB’s Principles recommend the terms of data access \ndisclosed include “access frequency, data scope, and retention period.”  \n“[In Mexico], mechanisms are not defined yet but the standard \nspecifications and rules will be developed for consent revocation.”\nMariana Velázquez Suárez, Expert,  \nMexico Open Banking\n“According to the new data privacy law [in Nigeria], customers can \nrevoke consent but the ways and means to do that are not well defined.”\nAdédèjì Olówè, Trustee,\nOpen Banking Nigeria\n“In New Zealand a customer can revoke their consent in their \nauthenticated environment at the API Provider (ASPSP). The ASPSP \ndoes not have to push a notification of the revoked consent to the \nThird Party (TPP). However, we have developed easy tools for TPPs \nto review all consents held.”\nSteve Wiggins, Chief Executive,\nPaymentsNZ\n1110\n\nRules and restrictions regarding \nconsumer consent\nRules and restrictions \nregarding data use\nSome data sharing regimes also have specific rules around with whom data can be shared. In the UK, a TPP whitelist \nis used to restrict the API framework to organisations that are trusted. This whitelist, now known as the Open Banking \nDirectory, was built so that the CMA9 and other banks could identify the TPP seeking to access its APIs and confirm \nthat the TPP has the appropriate regulatory permissions. This vetting process ensures a higher level of security, and \ntherefore trust in the overall infrastructure which could help promote greater innovation.\nSimilarly processes are happening in other countries as well. Australia is following the model of the UK in requiring \nthat all third parties participating in CDR-powered services be accredited. Mexico will require service providers to be \nauthorised by the relevant Supervisory Commission, under specific requirements laid out by the CNBV. The National \nBanking and Securities Commission (CNBV), is a decentralized body of the Ministry of Finance and Public Credit (SHCP), \nwith powers regarding authorisation, regulation, supervision and sanction on the various sectors and entities that make \nup the financial system in Mexico. Nigeria too will require its Payment Solutions Services Providers (PSSPs) to connect \nwith banks through a verification process.\nWhitelisting is also one of the places where PSD2 and Open Banking differ. Although PSD2 plans to offer strong \ncustomer authentication (SCA), alongside other security features, they will not have a list of authorised parties. In \naddition to the EU, New Zealand and Canada do not have any specific rules around who consumers can consent to \nsharing banking data with, and Japan is only limited by its Personal Information Protection Law (PIPL).\nOne specific rule around acquiring consent that has appeared in a couple regulations has been “bundled consent”. \nHong Kong’s personal data law labels this as “where a data user collects personal data from a customer through a \nservice application form which is designed in such a way that renders it impracticable for the customer to refuse \nconsent to the use of his personal data for purposes unrelated to the services to be provided to the customer.” Both \nAustralia and Hong Kong specifically deny this type of consent.\nAcross countries rules also exist around the purposes for which shared data can \nbe used. This could vary from restrictions on what purposes that data can be \nshared for, to merely requiring a purpose be clearly stated, to none at all. \nIn data sharing programmes such as Open Banking, PSD2, and others, the only \nexplicit restriction on types of activity for which banking data can be shared \nare related to other criminal laws, such as financing terrorism or for money \nlaundering. \nUnder most consent rules, data is consented to be shared for specific purposes \nthat are explicitly stated, using shared data for any purpose not stated is breaking \nthe agreed rules.  Japan’s data protection law restricts the use of data in this \nway, as does Canada’s privacy laws. Canada includes restricting banks from even \nsharing financial data with their subsidiary companies, such as an insurance \ncompany. Mexico’s FinTech Law similarly allows only for data to be used for the \nauthorised purpose of the customer, as does Brazil.\nAustralia takes a different approach and imbues the need to state the purpose \nas part of the accreditation process to become a trusted TPP. This is then verified \nwith unambiguous disclosure of how the data will be used again at the consent \nstage.\nAcross India, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Nigeria, New Zealand and the US, specific rules \nfor Open Banking have not been created, instead, general legislative frameworks \nfor individual countries apply.\n“With the implementation of Open Banking in Mexico, in order for a third \nparty to be able to connect to the regulatory APIs to access customer \ndata, they require prior customer consent. The third party will have to be \nauthorized by the relevant Supervisory Commission and will have to meet \nspecific requirements in order to be authorized. At the CNBV the secondary \nregulation is under development.” \n“In the Fintech Law of Mexico, article 76, says that the transactional \ndata will only be used for the specific purposes authorized by the \ncustomer and data will be treated as personal data which falls under \nthe scope of the privacy law. The secondary regulation is still under \ndevelopment and it is being considered the scope of the use of data.” \nMariana Velázquez Suárez, Expert,  \nMexico Open Banking\nMariana Velázquez Suárez, Expert,  \nMexico Open Banking\n1312\n\nEU 90 days\nUK 90 days\nAustralia 12 months\nNew Zealand 12 months\n \nConsent in Open Banking UK \nby Miles Cheetham, Head of Propositions, Open Banking Implementation Entity\nThere is no question that consumer consent is an area that requires greater clarity and definition as data sharing \necosystems develop. It’s crucial for building trust with consumers, but the lack of consistency in which consent is \nexplained and obtained can cause consumer confusion. There are a number of dimensions to this.\nThe respective definitions of consent and explicit consent under GDPR and PSD2 are critical.  How and when this needs \nto be presented to the consumer and how the differences between these two regulations can be made clear continues \nto challenge many.\nWhere possible, our emerging view is that the account information services provider (AISP) – a type of third party \nprovider (TPP) - should consider what legislation or policies the consent requirement is coming from. Once this is \ndetermined, the AISP can capture this in their Terms and Conditions or elsewhere in launching their service. This should \nalso cover aspects such as sharing data with other parties where it is required to create the end “product”. \nThis then allows other consent requirements to be presented as a separate request.  As AISPs need to comply with \nconsent arrangements provided for under PSD2 and a lawful basis under GDPR, the consumer needs to know exactly \nwhat they are agreeing to and under what terms. It is our emerging view this can be made very clear and might \naddress:\n•  The purpose for sharing their personal data\n•  The value exchange – what the consumer will get in return for sharing\n•  The actual data, which the Open Banking Implementation Entity has defined as a set of data clusters\n•  The parameters under which it is being shared i.e. when it starts, for how long, the frequency of access being     \n  granted to the AISP and what rights are triggered - and when - in respect of that personal data\nBuilding a clear, well-understood consent system with a good customer journey is essential \nto the success of the Open Banking ecosystem. \nThis will allow both banks and AISPs to be confident that they are meeting their regulatory requirements. Most \nimportantly, we consider that this is an area which is essential to get right in order to establish trust with the consumer \nand therefore provide a key building block in a healthy data sharing economy.\nFrom the consumer’s perspective we can summarise the key aspects that are important:\n•  Setting up a new service should not only be simple, but the key terms and the use of their personal data must be   \n  clear. This is where GDPR comes to the fore\n•  Granting consent to share personal data under Open Banking must make it very clear why it’s needed, what’s being  \n  shared, for how long etc. - and what the consumer will get for doing this. This is where PSD2 is the regulatory driver\n  The management and revocation of consent and its distinct implications from a PSD2 or GDPR perspective must be  \n  understood by all players, as well as the end consumer. Importantly, a bank or TPP should easily be able to \n  recognise under what legislation the right arises as well as the implications of an end consumer exercising that right \n  under each legislation. At this stage, both PSD2 and GDPR must be addressed \nA great deal to consider. If we can collectively get these dimensions right then we’ll be laying down the right foundation \nfor the success of not just Open Banking but the wider data sharing economy that is developing. \nDuration of consent\nThe duration of consent refers to the length of time a consumer consents to share \ndata with a third party. It is the length of time for which that consent is valid and in \nwhich the third party can use the data.\nAs of this publication, only the UK, EU, Australia and New Zealand have defined \nconsent durations for their Open Banking initiatives. The UK and EU follow the 90 \nday guidelines set under PSD2, while Australia and New Zealand have decided to \nset a 12 month consent period.\nBrazil Undefined\nCanada Undefined\nHong Kong Undefined\nIndia Undefined\nJapan Undefined\nMalaysia Undefined\nMexico Undefined\nNigeria Undefined\nUSA Undefined\nCountry Time Period\nCountry Time Period\n1514\n\nThe consequences of breaking \nthe rules\nWith rules and regulations around accreditation and authorisation of third party service providers, there needs to be \nconsequences for breaking the rules. Dispute mechanisms can also be created to help mediate conflicts, but penalties \nexist to encourage good behaviour. These penalties can range from organisations being suspended from the data \nsharing system, to having their banking licenses revoked, to fines and potential prison time. \nOpen Banking in the UK and PSD2 build on previous legislation in complaint resolution by increasing customer rights \nin the area of complaints handling. PSD2 requires payment providers to respond to and resolve complaints in a timely \nand appropriate manner. For example, payment providers must respond to complaints about customers being out of \nfunds within 15 days. \nIn the UK the CMA required a customer redress mechanism to manage consumer complaints to ensure that complaints \nare appropriately dealt with between the bank and the TPP. While the regulations set out liability rules, which are \nparticularly important in the case of a disputed payment, Open Banking is developing a Dispute Management System \nwhich enables multiple third parties to resolve disputes between themselves, speeding up resolution.\nMost data protection regimes give the data subject the ability to raise complaints for breaking the rules around data \nsharing use. From this there are provisions for investigations into the claims, as well as the possibility for dispute \nresolution and arbitration. Depending on the outcome of the investigation and the severity of the breach there are \ndifferent responses. Interestingly, in Canada it is explicitly stated that the findings of the investigation can be published.\nIn Mexico the FinTech Law grants Supervisory Commissions to suspend data exchange totally or partially, as well as \ntemporarily or definitively. New Zealand similarly has the ability to terminate offenders from the API Centre and remove \ntheir APIs. Australia can revoke accreditation from the ACCC and the Central Bank of Nigeria can revoke a banking \nlicense. \nNigeria, Japan, Canada, New Zealand and Mexico all have stated criminal punishments for severe breaches of the \nregulations. Mexico’s FinTech Law specifically states that fines can be anywhere 5,000 and 150,000 Mexican pesos, and \nbetween three to nine years in prison.\n“In New Zealand, our framework requires organisations to register as an API Provider \n(ASPSPs) or Third Party (TPPs) and sign up to the API Centre’s Terms and Conditions \nin order to use the API Standards. One of these terms relates to ensuring appropriate, \nclear customer consent is obtained and maintained. If this term is breached it may \nresult in suspension of an ASPSPs/TPPS registration and ultimately result in termination \nfrom the API Centre. This means that the terminated ASPSP/TPP right to use the API \nStandards or a Standardised API with another ASPSP/TPP is revoked and they must \nimmediately stop using the API Standards with other ASPSPs/TPPs. They must also \nremove any express or implied connection to the API Centre and the API Standards.” \n“The Fintech Law of Mexico grants powers to the Supervisory Commissions to \nsuspend partially/totally and temporary/definitively the exchange of data when the \nparties do not comply with the standards and the rules for the exchange” \n“For a TPP/PSSP, licensed by the Central Bank of Nigeria, their licenses can be revoked \nor they can be fined. The actual fines are not codified, however, according to the \nNational Information Technology Development Agency (NITDA) data privacy rule, \ncompanies can be fined up to N10m of annual revenue or 2%; whichever is greater.” \nAdédèjì Olówè, Trustee,\nOpen Banking Nigeria\nSteve Wiggins, Chief Executive,\nPaymentsNZ\nMariana Velázquez Suárez, Expert,  \nMexico Open Banking\n\nConclusionAppendix\nConsent is a complicated, but necessary aspect of data sharing and governance, especially within the banking sector \nwhere data can provide significant insights into the activities of people and organisations and where misuse of that data \ncan lead to significant harm. Consent is inextricably tied to the legal, political, economic and social idiosyncrasies of a \ncountry, region, or market. This means that certain aspects can be hard to compare, and that regional knowledge is \nvery important for operating across markets.\nHowever there are some key similarities regarding how consent is given and revoked, as countries place importance on \nit be explicit, well-informed, straightforward, and for a clear purpose. Countries also believe in limits and punishments, \nthough these can be varied and have a strong link to the privacy laws of a country.\nSome countries have similar consent environments to each other. Australia and New Zealand have built their Open \nBanking initiatives off of the UK model and the three countries have similar consent environments.\nThe “redirect model” of obtaining consent is seen worldwide as well, from Europe to Australia and New Zealand, to \nNigeria’s Open Banking environment as well. \nThe ability and ease to revoke consent is seen as important as to give it. Most consent environments have implemented \nor are implementing the ability to revoke consent as easily as the ability to give it.\nMost countries have not decided on the exact length of time that consent should be granted for. Those that do fall \nunder the PSD2 mandated length of 90 days, or in the case of Australia and New Zealand have opted for 12 months.\nAs Open Banking is becoming an increasingly multinational movement, and inspiring similar initiatives in other sectors, \nthen we recommend that banks and regulators perform and openly publish further research to make it easier for \npeople and organisations to understand the rules for consent that apply to them.\nThis research could deepen our work, for example by exploring whether there are differences in the definitions of \nterms such as ‘explicit’ and ‘informed’, but it could also cover further research questions. \nSome suggestions that we identified in our work were:\nContinuing to research Open Banking internationally and engaging with the global community to share best practises \nwill help Open Banking initiatives create impact and lead to a more open and trustworthy data ecosystem.\nWho is allowed to consent on behalf of a business?\nHow does consent vary across sectors and different categories of data?\nCan people delegate consent to a third party and, if so, under what conditions?\nHow do customers understand the rules of consent? \nHow do banks and third party providers understood the rules of consent?\nAre the penalties for breaking the rules enforced?\nContributers\nNameRoleOrganisation\nDavid BeardmoreCommercial DirectorODI\nJosh D’AddarioConsultantODI\nMiranda MarcusR&D Programme ManagerODI\nPeter WellsDirector of Public PolicyODI\nSonia DuarteUser ResearcherODI\nAndy WhiteCEOAustralia Payments Network and on the \nAdvisory Committee of Data 61\nAdédèjì OlówèTrusteeOpen Banking Nigeria\nGerry GaetzCEOPayments Canada\nEmma SteeleyCEOAccountScore\nJumpei MiwaDirector, Fintech and Innovation OfficeFinancial Services Agency\nMariana Velázquez \nSuárez\nExpertMexico Open Banking\nMiles CheethamHead of PropositionsOpen Banking Ltd.\nRubén BajoCOOAfterbanks - Morpheus Aiolos S.L.\nSteve WigginsChief ExecutivePayments NZ\n1918\n\nInterview questions\nSupporting documents\n•  Are any important actors missing?
