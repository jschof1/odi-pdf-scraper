Several keywords \ndid not match against \nany firms. This could \nprovide tentative \nevidence of gaps in the \nmarket.\nThe majority of firms we \nidentified who provide \ndata assurance services \nwere incorporated in the \nlast 10 years. \nThe average birth rate \namongst data assurance \nfirms is almost 12% per \nannum. \nIn keeping with other \nemerging sectors, it is \nhard to identify a specific \ndata assurance market. \nData assurance activities \nmay in several cases \nhave become part of the \noffer of firms active \nacross different traditional \nsectors\n\n8frontier economics\nMost firms engaged in data assurance activities have fewer than 10 \nemployees\n0\n50\n100\n150\n200\n250\n300\n350\n400\n450\n0-1\nemployees\n2-10\nemployees\n11-50\nemployees\n51-200\nemployees\n201-500\nemployees\n501-1,000\nemployees\n1,001-5,000\nemployees\n5,001-10,000\nemployees\n10,001+\nemployees\nNumber of firms\n▪56% of the firms who are engaged in data assurance activities had 10 or fewer employees and 87% have \nfewer than 50 employees. We identified seven firms who each employ over 10,000 staff (these are primarily \nlarge audit / accounting firms). The majority of these employees in the largest firms will not be directly \ninvolved in data assurance activities.  \nThe majority of identified firms have a relatively small number of employees each\nBreakdownofdataassurancefirmsbyemployeesizeband\nIn total, we identified 890 firms engaged in data assurance activities (for simplicity we refer to these as “data \nassurance firms” throughout, even though in some cases their commercial activity will not be entirely data \nassurance related). We have conservatively estimated that approximately 30,000 staff are involved in the \ndelivery of data assurance activities. This assumes that only a small proportion of total employment in the \nlargest firms we identified is related to data assurance. \nSIZE OF MARKET\nThere is a considerable \namount of economic \nactivity in the data \nassurance space in the \nUK. Employment in firms \noffering data assurance \nis spread across a wide \nnumber of firms of \ndifferent sizes\nKEY TAKEAWAY\nNote: The total employment figure is based on the number of employees who have listed themselves as an employee of a firm on LinkedIn. We have \nassumed that only 1% of employees in firms with >1000 employees are engaged in data assurance activities.  The firm level employment band data is a \nseparate variable.

The work will also serve as a benchmark for later years.\n\n15frontier economics\nWe have focused on four specific research questions throughout our \nwork\nWhat is the size of \nmarket?\n▪How many firms are active in this space currently in the UK?\n▪What is the size distribution of firms currently active in this market in terms of revenue and number of \nemployees?\n▪What is the aggregate size of this market in terms of employees and revenue?\nHow mature is the \nmarket?\n▪What is the distribution of incorporation dates amongst included firms?\n▪How do recent market joiners compare to more established firms?\nIn what sectors and \nareas are firms based?\n▪Across what sectors of the economy are data assurance firms most often categorised?\n▪Wherein the UK do data assurance firms have their HQs?\nWhat are the types of \nproducts and services \noffered?\n▪What types of offering exist in the market?\n▪What are the typical business models adopted by data assurance firms?\n\n16frontier economics\nData assurance services can help to build confidence in data and data \npractices\nAssurance is about \nbuilding confidence \nand demonstrating \ntrustworthiness to \nothers via evidence.\nFor the purposes of this work we are defining data assurance as the process by which:\n“organisations assess, and demonstrate trustworthiness in their own data and data \npractices as well as the data and data practices of others.This in turn can help build \ntrust and confidence in data ecosystems.” \nOrganisations across the economy may undertake internal data assurance activities and \nthey may also work with commercial data assurance specialists. These specialist \norganisations provide business-to-business offerings that allow organisations to:\n▪understand risks and opportunities in the data they create, use and share themselves, \n▪to trust that the data they access and reuse from third parties\n▪to share data with confidence that those they are sharing with are set up to use it while \navoiding harmful impacts.\nData assurance is the process by which organisations assess, and demonstrate \ntrustworthiness in their own data and data practices as well as the data and data \npractices of others \n\n17frontier economics\nData assurance processes are undertaken on an ongoing basis\n▪We are considering data assurance an ongoing process which allows organisations to \ntake informed decisions about the data they hold currently or will collect in the future. \nFirms engaging in data assurance activities may provide guidance, expertise and \ntechnical solutions as part of an overall offering.This enables their clients to make \ninformed decisions with regards to the responsible usage of data to achieve their \nstrategic goals.\n▪Data assurance tools can help inform these decisions but some level of judgement will \nstill be required and application to the relevant context at hand will be needed. The \nprecise data assurance services that an industry or specific firm requires will \nvary depending on the type and volume of data collected, its underlying \ncharacteristics and the objectives of the organisation using the data assurance \nservice. Therefore a one-size-fits all approach to data assurance or a “tick-box” \nexercise is unlikely to be successful. \nData assurance will be a process that organisations undertake on an ongoing basis. \nThese processes may occur in real time or be centred around certain events such \nas data audits\nAssurance is an \nongoing process which \ninforms decision \nmaking in \norganisations\n\n18frontier economics\nData assurance services can be used by data holders and data users\nData holder \n(individuals and \norganisations that can \ncreated or collected \ndata)\nData users \n(individuals and \norganisations that can \nbenefit from \naccessing data)\nSome types of data users, in particular businesses seeking access to data, need to be able to assure others that they are \ntrustworthy in their use of data. For example, data users mayengage with data assurance providers to demonstrate how their data \nstorage processes are robust and meet industry standards to allay fears of data misuse and/or leakage.\nOrganisations who hold data need to be able to provide assurance that the data is fit for use (and possible onward sharing) by \nothers. Data holders’ assurance activities could include implementing transparent quality control procedures and providing \nbackground information on how information has been collected and what rights to reuse the data have been provided, through \nclear licensing.\n\n19frontier economics\nFirms may engage with data assurance services to avoid negative \noutcomes\nAVOID NEGATIVE \nOUTCOMES\nFirms may be motivated by \na desire to avoid negative \noutcomes associated with \nviolating existing data \nrules and regulations\n▪The rollout of economy-wide \nregulations such as the General Data \nProtection Regulation (GDPR) has \nraised awareness about the \nimportance of appropriate data \ngovernance and privacy procedures \nin relation to personal data. Specific \nindustries will also have their own rules, \ncodes of conduct and/or best practices \nwhich individual organisations will want \nto adhere to. \n▪Data breaches or other negative \nshocks can lead to fines and \ntemporary or permanent losses of \nrevenue or profitability. We have seen \nseveral of these occurring in recent \nyears.\n1\nData assurance offerings such as \n“certification” and “accreditation” can help \nto ensure that organisations have \nappropriate processes in place to comply \nwith existing rules and regulations \n(Oxford Insights, 2019).\n▪Certification refers to evaluating \nprocesses or systems against certain \nstandards.\n▪Accreditation assessthe competence \nof an organisation to perform certain \ndata related tasks\nRole of data assurance\n\n20frontier economics\nFirms may engage with data assurance services to maximise value from \ndata assets\nMAXIMISE THE \nVALUE FROM \nDATA ASSETS\nFirms increasingly want to \nmake the most of the data \nthey hold and ensure that \nbusiness data becomes a \nkey organisational asset. \n▪As data has become abundant in the \nmodern world an increasing number \nof organisations are realising that \ndata they collect and/or hold can \ndrive productivity and inclusion\neither via improved internal decision \nmaking or external usage. \n2\nData assurance offerings can help to \n▪boost internal trust in an organisation’s \ndata and therefore lead to greater \nacceptance of evidence-based \ndecision-making in relation to \ncommercial operations.\n▪increase consumers’ trust in a \nbusiness which in turn can lead to \ngreater brand value or profitability.\nRole of data assurance\n\n21frontier economics\nData assurance services are one avenue by which data sharing can be \nencouragedwhich leads to better societal and economic outcomes\n▪Data assurance processes (in conjunction with other factors) can enable greater \ndata sharing (to underpin these decisions) help provide confidence that data informed \ndecisions are reliable. \n▪For example, a public sector health data holder may be willing in principle to share the \ndata they have collected with academics who are seeking to carry out a piece of socially \nbeneficial research. However, this sharing may not happen if the data holder has \nconcerns about the processes and infrastructure that the researchers have in place to \nstore sensitive data. Data assurance services can help to overcome this barrier:\nData \nassurance can \nlead to greater \ndata sharing\nIncreasing the proportion of decisions taken based on data can generate significant \nbenefits for all of society. \n\n22frontier economics\nThe theory of change of data assurance activities helps to lay out the \nlogical flow of how they can lead to societal and economic benefits\nImpacts: societal and \neconomic benefits\nOutcomes: changes in \ndata usage\nOutputs: changes in \ntrust\nActivities: drivers of trust\nData assurance activities allow \norganisations to assess, and \ndemonstrate trustworthiness in \ntheir own data and data \npractices as well as the data \nand data practices of others. A \npotential data user (such as the \nacademic in our example above) \ncan use data assurance to \ndemonstrate the quality of their \ndata practices. \nIncreased data assurance \nactivities can (in conjunction \nwith other factors) help build \ntrust and confidence in data \necosystems. \nA data holder (such as the \npublic sector organisation in our \nexample above) may share data \nwith greater confidence if they \nsee potential users \ndemonstrating their competence \nvia data assurance services.\nGreater levels of trust can lead \nto more data being shared and \nused. This in turn leads to \nbetter decisions actions and \ninsights. \nIn our example above this \ncould include more healthy \ndata being shared and socially \nbeneficially research being \ncarried out to inform future \nhealthcare design for example. \nConsumer welfare\nGross value added\nEfficiency\nWider societal benefits\n\n23frontier economics\nA data value chain can help to identify the stages at which value is \ncreated \nSource: Data Value chain adapted from Attard et al.

The overall size \nof the market is an interesting metric in itself and also helps to build our understanding regrading \npotential gaps in provision.\nOur approach relies on firms’ descriptions of their activity primarily via their own websites. \nThis will capture the vast majority of firms offering relevant services but like any source of \ninformation it will not be 100% comprehensive. For example some firms may give very \nlittle detail of their service offering on their website and may therefore not appear in our \nlist. \nOur study did not involve an empirical market definition exercise using competition \neconomics. However, our chosen definition does have implications for our estimates of \ndata assurance market size. We are focusing purely on suppliers of data assurance \nservices and are also primarily interested in those firms who offer tailored support for \nclients / customers rather than just a technical platform. \nThere are certain caveats we need to bear in mind when interpreting the market sizing results: \nResearch Question 1: \nSize of market\n\n34frontier economics\n91% of the 890 identified firms had employment information available. \nThey vary significantly in size based on their employee base\n2\nWe have conservatively estimated that approximately 30,000 staff are involved in the delivery of data assurance \nactivities. \n▪56% of the firms who are engaged in data assurance \nactivities had < 10 employees and 87% have < 50 \nemployees. \n▪We identified seven firms who each employ > 10,000 staff \n(these are primarily large professional services firms). The \nmajority of these employees in the largest firms will not be \ndirectly involved in data assurance activities. \n▪The information refers to headcount rather than full time \nequivalents.\n▪Data assurance activities are likely to be a subset of a wider \npackage of services especially for the larger firms. However, it is \nnot possible to separately estimate the proportion of their \nemployees who carry out these activities. This in some cases \nmay overstate the scale of data assurance activities within firms. \nMajority of identified firms have a relatively small number of \nemployees each (see chart on next slide)\nData presented below is likely to be highly representative of all \nidentified firms but caution is needed when interpreting it \n1\nIn total, we identified 890 firms engaged in data assurance activities (for simplicity we refer to these as “data \nassurance firms” throughout, even though in some cases their commercial activity will not be entirely data assurance \nrelated \nResearch Question 1: \nSize of market\n\n35frontier economics\nMajority of identified firms have a relatively small number of employees \neach\nBreakdownofdataassurancefirmsbyemployeesizeband\n0\n50\n100\n150\n200\n250\n300\n350\n400\n450\n0-1 employees2-10 employees11-50 employees51-200\nemployees\n201-500\nemployees\n501-1,000\nemployees\n1,001-5,000\nemployees\n5,001-10,000\nemployees\n10,001+\nemployees\nNumber of firms\nNote: The total employment figure is based on the number of employees who have listed themselves as an employee of a firm on LinkedIn. We have assumed that only 1% of \nemployees in firms with >1000 employees are engaged in data assurance activities.  The firm level employment band data is a separate variable. These two separate \nmeasures of employment will be highly correlated but will not always be completely consistent. \nSource: Frontier analysis of data collected by glass.ai\nResearch Question 1: \nSize of market\n\n36frontier economics\nThe size distribution of data assurance firms is skewed towards larger \nfirms relative to the UK as a whole\nComparisonofdataassurancefirmstoallUKfirmsbyemployeesizeband\n▪Recent ONS data on all tax registered UK firms suggests that 90% \nof all firms employ 9 staff or fewer, 8.5% employ 10-49 staff and the \nremaining 1.9% employ over 50 staff. \n▪Using these same categories of staff numbers, we find that in our \nsample of firms, larger firms are more common compared to the \ndistribution of all UK firms. E.g. 31% of the firms we identified \ncontain 10-49 employees as opposed to 8.5% of all UK firms.\n▪It is possible that a larger proportion of the smallest firms in the UK \ndo not have an online presence and hence won’t be picked up in our \nsample\n▪It may be that data audit type services tend to be offered by \nrelatively large firms which is leading to the results we have \nhighlighted. \nOur sample of firms engaged in data assurance activities contain \nan above average rate of larger firms...\n... and there are a number of reasons for this\nResearch Question 1: \nSize of market\nSource: Frontier analysis of data collected by glass.ai\n\n37frontier economics\nTurnover is an alternative measure of size however our insights are not \nrepresentative due to high levels of missing data on revenue\n3\nTurnover of firms engaged in data assurance activities active in the market\n▪Annual turnover data (sourced from publicly available \nCompanies House information) is only available for a small \nsubset of the identified firms. Specifically we have this \nmetric for only 43 of our 890 firms (5%). \n▪We have illustrated the proportion of firms engaged in data \nassurance activities (who published a turnover figure) in \ndifferent size categories. We found that almost 80% of these \nfirms have an annual turnover in excess of £5 million.\nData assurance firms who do report a turnover tend to be \nvery large on average (see chart on next slide)\n▪This low coverage rate is primarily because small companies \nare exempted from providing this information as part of annual \naccounts and our sample of firms are predominantly SMEs.\n▪Large firms will offer a suite of services and data assurance \nservices are only a subset. Therefore, some proportion of \nrevenue will be generated as a result of non-data assurance \nactivities. It is not possible to separately estimate the proportion \nof revenue that is linked to data assurance activities. Therefore \nwe have reported total revenue. \nTherefore turnover breakdowns will not be representative of \nthe wider market\nResearch Question 1: \nSize of market\n\n38frontier economics\nData assurance firms who do report a turnover tend to be very large on \naverage \nBreakdownofdataassurancefirmsbyturnover\nNote:missingdatameanthatthischartisnotrepresentativeoftheentiredataassurancemarket\nSource: Frontier analysis of data collected by glass.ai\nResearch Question 1: \nSize of market\n\n39frontier economics\nExamining the rate of new entry into the data assurance market can \nallow us to asses market maturity \nMATURITY OF \nMARKET\nOur second research question \nfocuses on the maturity of the \ndata assurance market. We are \ninterested in the extent to \nwhich data assurance service \nofferings are well established \nor rapidly emerging. The \nincorporation dates of firms \nthat we have identified allow us \nto proxy market maturity. \nExploring the incorporation dates of data assurance firms allows us to identify trends in market \ngrowth \n▪We can examine when our data assurance firms incorporated in the UK for the first time. Therefore \nwe can determine which of our final list of market participants “entered” the market in each year. \n▪We have sourced incorporation dates from publicly available Companies House records. Date of \nincorporation data is available for 588 of our 890 data assurance firms (66%). \nIt is important to note that this rate of firm entry does not represent overall growth in the \nnumber of relevant companies. This is because we cannot capture firms which may have \nbeen present in earlier years but have subsequently exited the market and were therefore \nnot identified via our search term methodology. \nIn addition, in some cases larger firms may have initially incorporated a relatively long \ntime ago to offer services which are not in scope of our work (e.g. accounting services) \nand started to offer data assurance services more recently. We are not able to determine \nthis and therefore our estimates of market entry will not always correspond to actual \ncommencement of data assurance offerings. \nThere are certain caveats we need to bear in mind when interpreting the results: \nResearch Question 2: \nMaturity of market\n\n40frontier economics\nWe found that 58% of the data assurance firms that we identified were \nincorporated in the last ten years \n▪According to the latest ONS data (2020 B) the average birth rate of firms (new entrants as a proportion of active firms) was 12.7% per annum \n(between 2018-19). In relation to our data assurance firms specifically between 2014-2020 an average of 44 new firms entered thedata \nassurance market each year (average birth rate of 11.7%). \n▪Therefore the entry of data assurance firms is roughly in line with that of the wider economy. This could potentially signal an opportunity for \nmore rapid growth in the future if demand grows in line with trends in data availability. In total 58% of the data assurance firms that we \nidentified were incorporated in the last ten years and 90% were incorporated after 2000.\n▪We cannot identify firms who have incorporated but subsequently left the market in previous years. However, our work does provide a useful \nbenchmark in this regard and subsequent analysis can track this group of firms that we have identified longitudinally. \n▪We have also reported the equivalent figure of market entry for 2021 (10 firms) even though it is clearly not complete and therefore not fully \ncomparable with previous years.\nRecent years have witnessed significant market entry (see chart on next slide)\nThis rate of firm entry does not represent overall growth in the number of relevant companies \nResearch Question 2: \nMaturity of market\n\n41frontier economics\nRecent years have witnessed significant market entry to provide data \nassurance services \n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n1977198519881990199219941996199820002002200420062008201020122014201620182020\nNo. of new entrants\nMarketentryovertime\nSource: Frontier analysis of data collected by glass.ai\nResearch Question 2: \nMaturity of market\n\n42frontier economics\nNewer entrants are smaller than more established firms \n▪We have compared the more recent market entrants to all data assurance firms in terms of number of employees. Firms who have \nincorporated since 2018 are unsurprisingly small on average than more established firms. Specifically, 95% of the recent entrants employ 10 \nor fewer staff while the equivalent figure for all data assurance firms is only 56%.\n▪This does not imply that the recent market entrants play an unimportant role in the market. It is these firms which may be bringing innovative \nofferings to market to address previously unmet needs. In addition, more recent entrants may offer the highest potential for future growth and \nexpansion in future years. Answering these two questions could be an important part of future research in this context. \nThe majority of new firms offering data assurance services are smaller businesses \nComparisonofrecentdataassuranceentrants(since2018)toalldataassurancefirmsbyemployeesizeband\nResearch Question 2: \nMaturity of market\nSource: Frontier analysis of data collected by glass.ai\n\n43frontier economics\nOur third research question focuses on thesectoral and distribution of \nactivities in the market (1/2)\nTYPES OF FIRMS\nOur third research question \nexplores the sectoral \ndistribution of data assurance \nfirms.\nIdentifying the distribution of \ndata assurance firms will help \nus to understand the type of \neconomic activity that such \nfirms are engaged in.\n▪We have defined sectors according to glass.ai’sown classification system \n(see Annex). This features 14 sector groupings (e.g. technology) and 109 \nsectors (e.g. computer hardware). This bespoke classification system is based \non data read from the web -predicted from the company description and other \nweb content. \n▪We have also defined sectors by the Office for National Statistics’ (ONS) \nStandard Industrial Classification (SIC) codes The SIC is divided into 21 \nsections (e.g. manufacturing), which are then further broken down into 88 \ndivisions (e.g. manufacture of textiles), 272 groups (e.g. manufacture of other \ntextiles) and 615 classes (e.g. manufacture of carpets and rugs). SIC codes \nare used by ONS to classify businesses according to the type of economic \nactivity in which they are engaged. The two classification systems are not \ndirectly comparable\nData assurance firms will not all be included under a single ONS SIC code \nclass or glass.ai sector. The different classifications of the data \nassurance firms further demonstrates the difficulty in isolating relevant \nservices within a single traditional market. This is because data \nassurance activity can play a role across many traditional sectors and stages \nof the value chain.\nThere are certain caveats we need to bear in mind when interpreting the results: \nNote: We have used both of these classification systems because they offer distinct advantages. glass.ai’sclassification is more recent and therefore may \nrepresent a more up-to-date breakdown of firms. However, SIC codes are widely used as part of official statistics which allows us to compare data \nassurance firms to the rest of the economy.. Both of these distributions indicate the range of sectors that data assurance firmsare active in.\nResearch Question 3: \nIn what sectors are firms based?\nSectoral \ndistribution\n\n44frontier economics\nOur third research question focuses on thesectoral and distribution of \nactivities in the market (2/2)\nTYPES OF LOCATIONS\nOur third research question \nalso  explores the geographical \ndistribution of data assurance \nfirms.\nIdentifying the distribution of \ndata assurance firms will help \nus to understand the locations \nof economic activity that such \nfirms are based in.\nThis will provide an indication of which parts of the UK are flooded with \ndata assurance firms and which areas have less provision. However, \nmany of these types of services may not require physical interaction so \npotential customers across the UK may be able to tap in the offerings of \nfirms who are not necessarily physically proximate\nThere are certain caveats we need to bear in mind when interpreting the results: \nSome data assurance firms might have multiple offices across UK. We have \nidentified their main offices based on data read from the web -predicted from \nthe company description and other web content. \nGeographical \ndistribution\nResearch Question 3: \nIn what sectors are firms based?\n\n45frontier economics\nData assurance activity is spread across many different clusters of \neconomic activity as we would expect\nTopthreeglass.aiSectorGrouping:percentagesTopthreetwodigitSICcodes:percentages\nResearch Question 3: \nIn what sectors are firms based?\n▪A glassi.ai sector grouping and sector is available for all of our 890 data assurance firms. Using this glass.ai classification system we \nhave found that 67% of data assurance firms identified in our sample are in the Technology sector grouping. The top three sector \ngroupings (this is the more aggregated level of economic activity) Technology, Professional Services, and Financial Services collectively \naccount for 96% of the firms in our sample firms (we have also explored the more granular sector breakdown which is presentedonthe next \npage). \n▪SIC codes are available for 579 of our data assurance firms (65%). The most commonly appearing SIC code divisions (two digit code) \nwas  Computer programming, consultancy and related activities.

We have also examined a more granular \nbreakdown to better understand the specific types of economic activities that the data assurance firms in our sample are undertaking. \n▪Using the glass.ai classification system we found the most common sectors, included Information Technology and Services, \nConsulting, and Computer Software. This illustrates the wide range of sectors that data assurance companies are active in. It also \nreinforces the point that we cannot isolate data assurance activities within a single traditional sector. \n▪We have also examined the sectoral mix of recent market entrants (firms that incorporated since 2018). Overall the breakdown is relatively \nsimilar to the pattern we observe amongst all data assurance firms. Recent entrants are slightly more likely than all data assurance \nfirms to be classified in the Information Technology and Services sector (48% vs 44%) and slightly less likely to be in the \nAccounting sector (1% vs. 2%).\nData assurance firms specialise in technology, finance and professional service areas \nSource: Frontier analysis of data collected by glass.ai\n\n47frontier economics\nWe cannot isolate data assurance activities within a single traditional \nsector (2)\nResearch Question 3: \nIn what sectors are firms based?\n▪We have examined the most common five digit SIC classifications amongst our data assurance firms.

Overall, 69% of firms in our sample have data which we can use to determine the relevant UK \nregions. From the table below, we see that there is a clear clustering of firms around London which contains 40% of the firmsinour sample. \nThis is more than twice the proportion of all UK firms who are based in London.\n▪This may suggest the emergence of a data assurance cluster in London. This is in keeping with wider tech industry location \ntrends. Previous research by Tech Nation (2021) found that London was fourth for tech VC investment globally in 2020 and is for example \nthe second biggest Fintech hub.

We based this list on \na rapid desk research exercise, our own experience and conversations with ODI. It represents a \nrobust and coherent list of potential activities, products and services but may not be entirely \ncomprehensive given the wide range of terminology used in this context. \n▪In addition, we also carried out specific deep dives into larger ‘accounting’ firms who were knew to \nbe active in this market. This allows us to better understand specific business moils and service \nofferings that are in place currently.\nExamining the number of firms that matched against search terms \nallowed us to highlight common assurance services\nTYPES OF PRODUCTS \nAND SERVICES\nOur last research question \nfocusses on the success of \nsearch terms in identifying \nfirms as part of our web crawl \nexercise. \nWe are interested in the type of \nproducts and services that are \noffered by the firms active in \nthe data assurance market and \nthe topic matches can provide \nan overall indication of this. \nIt also may be the case that firms do offer categories of products/services which are not \nexplicitly included in their website. If this is the case they will not be picked up by our \nanalysis. \nThere are certain caveats we need to bear in mind when interpreting the results: \nExploring which firms include specific search terms in their descriptions of their offerings \nprovides an indication of data assurance offerings present in the market. \nResearch Question 4: \nTypes of products and services offered\n\n53frontier economics\nThe majority of firms we identified may focus on a specific niche \nwithin the market\n0%\n10%\n20%\n30%\n40%\n50%\n60%\n70%\n80%\n90%\n100%\n12345+\nProportion of firms\nProportionoffirmsmatchingwithdifferentnumberoftopics\nResearch Question 4: \nTypes of products and services offered\nSub-sectoraldistributionoffirmsbynumberofemployees\n▪As part of the strategy to collect data on data assurance firms, we had identified 75 keywords / phrases. All of the data assurance firms we \nidentified matched against at least one of these 75 search terms. \n▪77% of the firms we identified only matched against a single keyword / phrase, 16% matched against two terms and the remaining 7% \nmatched against three or more terms. This provides tentative evidence that the firms we have identified tend on the whole to focus \non a specific niche within the topic of data assurance primarily (e.g. verification of source data or prevention of data leakage), \nrather than trying to provide a more all encompassing offer. Further research will be needed to confirm this\n▪We have also examined the number of topic matches of recent market entrants (firms that incorporated since 2018). Data assurance firms \nwho have incorporated more recently are slightly more likely to only match against a single of our keywords than all data \nassurance firms (80% vs. 77%). This may provide tentative evidence that newer firms are slightly more likely to be focusing on a specific \nniche of data assurance relative to more established firms. \nOverall, most firms may have narrow data assurance offerings\nSource: Frontier analysis of data collected by glass.ai\n\n54frontier economics\n52 out of 72 search terms identified all the firms in our sample \nResearch Question 4: \nTypes of products and services offered\n▪72% of the firms we identified were linked to one of the top 10 most frequent \ntopics. ‘Data management’, ‘Data governance’ and ‘Data Security’ were the most \nfrequently matched topics. The specific term ‘data assurance’ matched with only 8 firms. \nThese firms also matched against other terms-‘data management’, ‘data governance’, \n‘data security’, IT governance’, ‘data quality’ and ‘data breach’.\n▪The top 10 list included search terms from all five our search term categories \nwhich suggests the identified firms use a broad vocabulary to describe their \nofferings. Unsurprisingly it is the search terms from the “overarching category” which \nidentified the most firms. These more generic terms will capture more organisations than \nspecific articulations of products or services.  Some of these terms will be synonymous \nwith each other (data management and information management will likely refer to very \nsimilar service offerings). In other cases data assurance firms may be describing the \nsame problem from two different perspectives. For example, two firms may offer very \nsimilar services but one emphasises how they can increase quality while another \nfocuses on the avoidance of risk.\n▪We have also examined the frequency of successful matches amongst recent market \nentrants (firms that incorporated since 2018). The top-10 list is broadly similar. However, \ndata compliance and data integrity both feature in the top 10 of most commonly \nappearing terms when we look at recent market entrants only and do not feature \nin the overall list above. This could represent a slight shift in the type of offerings \namongst newer firms. \nMost of the data assurance firms are identified through a subset of topic \nmatches\nSuccessful search \nterms can help to \nidentify the types \nof products and \nservices offered \nin the market\n\n55frontier economics\nData management and data governance were the two most commonly \nidentified search terms\nProportionoffirmsidentifiedagainsttop10searchterms\nOverarching “foundational” terms\nData assurance services\nData assurance products\nCharacteristics of trustworthy \ndata\nAvoidance of negative \noutcomes\nSearchcategories\nSource: Frontier analysis of data collected by glass.ai\nResearch Question 4: \nTypes of products and services offered\n\n56frontier economics\nTerms such as data accreditation and data validation did not match \nagainst any firms\n▪Unsuccessful search terms included:\nFoundation terms such as data accreditation and data validity\nCharacteristics of trustworthy data such as data guarantee and data confidence \nServicessuch as computer assisted auditing techniques\nProductssuch as data documentation \nAvoidance of negative outcomes such as data loss prevention techniques\n▪This implies that these type of offerings are not explicitly referred to by data \nassurance firms themselves.

The \nsolutions ensure \nprevention of data \nleakage, whether at \nrest within the \nnetwork, mobile \ndevice or storage or \nindeed data in transit \nacross public or \nprivate networks.”\nAs described previously the data value chain describes various value adding process from initial collection of data through to its use and \nexploitation. Data assurance offerings exist currently in the market at each stage of this conceptual value chain. We have provided examples \nbelow which are taken directly from firms’ own descriptions and are illustrative rather than exhaustive. \nSource: adapted from Attard et al. (2016) and Attard et al.

The top ranked evidence (up to four \npieces per organisation has been included in our final dataset)\nFigure:Stepsinthedeepcrawlexercise\n▪Before carrying out the web crawl we knew that medium to large professional services firms offer some data assurance services(in addition \nto traditional financial auditing services or broader technology based consulting). We therefore carried out a deeper crawl across known UK \nprofessional services firms to:\noestablish which of these firms offered services which were in scope of our review; and\nohighlight the specific products and services that they offer and the business models they have adopted. \n▪This deep dive crawl consisted of three steps. This provided more granular and detailed data on the specific data assurance offerings of \nthese 15 firms than we have for the remainder of the sample. \nProfessional services firms will compose an important segment within the data assurance market \n1\n2\n3\nIdentify all potential professional services \nfirms\nIdentify which of these firms offers relevant \nservices\nCollect multiple pieces of information in \nterms of service offerings from each firm\n\n59frontier economics\nServices offered by professional services firms tended to fall into a \nnumber of categories\nWe have grouped the service offerings regarding data assurance activities described by professional services firms into a \nnumber of groups:\nImproving data \ngovernance\nData privacy & \nsecurity\nData \ncompliance\nIncreasing \ndata quality\nSharing data\nMaking best \nuse of data\nOutcome focused\nProcess focused\n▪Our clients have: \n“challenges with \nrespect to (further) \nsetting up data \ngovernance, master \ndata management, \ndata quality \nmanagement and \ndata lineage across \nthe entire \norganization”\n▪Our “services cover \na wide range of risk \nscenarios such as \nemployee error, \nalgorithmic bias, \nfaulty algorithm \ndesign, malicious \nmanipulation and \npoor data quality, \nall of which can \nlead to non-\ncompliance with \ndata protection and \nprivacy regulations”\n▪“Projects may be \nundertaken to \nprovide assurance \nfor the Board and \nother stakeholders \non data quality or \nentity status.”\n▪“Improving data \naccuracy and \ncreating valuable \ninsights for our \nclient”\n▪Data quality \nsolutions continue \nto mature through \nthe addition of more \naugmented \ncapabilities than \nbefore, driven by \ngrowing needs in \nexisting and new \nuse cases\n▪“Data management \nacross data \necosystems require \nsignificant time and \ninvestment just to \nachieve \nconsistency and \ntraceability to \nimprove trust with \ncustomers”\n▪“We are able to \nhelp companies \nmanage data, \nidentify and mitigate \nissues such as bias \nor unnecessary \naccess that could \ncompromise data \nintegrity, and drive \nincreased \nconfidence in \ninsights driven by \nAI ”\nCategory of \noffering / \ncapability \nExample \ndescription \nResearch Question 4: \nTypes of products and services offered\n\n60frontier economics\nThe professional services firms we identified refer to different \ncombinations of data assurance offerings \nResearch Question 4: \nTypes of products and services offered\n▪In the table below we have illustrated which of the 15 professional services firms included content on their website that referred to one of the \nsix topic categories which we defined. \n▪We can see that different firms use different terminology to describe their services and occupy different places in the market. The most \ncommon category of capability / offering relates to data governance. \nProfessional services firms will compose an important segment within the data assurance market \nSource: Frontier analysis of data collected by glass.ai\n\n61frontier economics\nWe have also examined the most common business models used \nby data assurance firms\n1 See for example: https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/small-business/what-is-a-business-model\nList of businesses model categories\nAdvertising\nAffiliate marketing\nBundling\nConsulting\nDigital goods\nDirect sales\nDistribution\nE-commerce\nFranchise\nLeasing\nLicensing\nManufacturer\nMarketplace\nPeer-to-peer\nProduct to service\nRetailer\nSubscription\nResearch Question 4: \nTypes of products and services offered\n▪To explore the types of commercial model employed by data assurance firms we \nhave examined the content of each data assurance firm’s website home page. This \nwill provide an indication of how data assurance firms earn revenue and what type \nof organisations they typically offer their services to. \n▪We firstly defined a list of 17 business models based on our previous experience \nand existing categorisations.1 We then crawled the website homepages for \nreferences to these known business models. This allowed us to determine the \nfrequency with which certain commercial operating models are being used. \n▪Firms may operate a mixed model with multiple revenue streams. Therefore it is \npossible that firms match against multiple business models categories. In total we \nbusiness model signals were picked up for 710 companies (80% of our list).\nWe can provide a high level indication of the business models that are being \nused by data assurance firms \n\n62frontier economics\nThe majority of data assurance firms are consultancies. Firms also note \ntargeted market sectors and revenue generation routes (1/2)\nConsulting is by far the most common business model identified (669 firms). It involves building up experience and \nexpertise in specific domains of data assurance and then carrying out work for clients.\nE.g. “We are dedicated to protecting client's reputation by providing strategic and pragmatic advice to provide information \nsecurity”\nExamples include:\n▪retailers (94 data assurance firms). E.g. “We provide the full suite of data management services \n(advisory, consultancy, Master Data Management (MDM), Product Information Management (PIM), \nData Quality. Client examples include leading Retailers, Manufacturers, Government Agencies”\n▪distributors (73 data assurance firms). E.g. “We are a data security, governance, regulation and \ncompliance (GRC) solution provider. Our systems help to protect over a million users in areas as \ndiverse as security services, manufacturing, and distribution”\n▪advertising platforms (80 data assurance firms). E.g. “specialise in design and delivery of \ninformation management software and technology products and platforms. We provide consultancy \nservices to the Information Technology, Advertising, Marketing, Design and Media and Transport \nindustries”\nOther examples of customer segments include e-commerce, finance and healthcare\nMany data assurance companies talk about the clients they serve (who themselves will \nadopt a variety of business models). \nCustomer \nbase\n1\nResearch Question 4: \nTypes of products and services offered\n\n63frontier economics\nThe majority of data assurance firms are consultancies.

E.g. “We cover Compliance, Security, Information \nGovernance and Contracts. Our services are accessible and cost effective with a monthly subscription \nservice that allow you to choose the packages and package components that apply to you”\n▪Licencing services (37 data assurance firms). E.g. “The company behind the new standard for data \nsecurity. We commercially exploit our IP through licensing agreements, and by offering a base product \nand implementation design book. Our team also brings the opportunity for consultancy, development and \nindustry thought-leadership”\nOther firms offer a subscription or licencing service to clients which features a mix of \nplatform access and ongoing sharing of expertise. \nResearch Question 4: \nTypes of products and services offered\n\n64frontier economics\n1.Executive summary4\n2.Background and context13\n3.Approach and methodology25\n4.Results 32\n5.Conclusion64\n6.References 67\n7.Annex 70\n\n65frontier economics\nOur work has provided a comprehensive overview ofthe firms providing \ndata assurance services in the UK and their characteristics \nOur work provides \nuseful insights into \nthe market for data \nassurance\n1\nFrontier Economics and glass.ai were commissioned by ODI to carry out a detailed study of \nthe size, features and characteristics of the market for data assurance services in the UK. \nThe novel dataset we have created and the subsequent analysis we have carried out has highlighted a \nnumber of interesting findings:\n▪We identified 890 providers who explicitly refer to data assurance capabilities or offerings.
