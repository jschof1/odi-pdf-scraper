Open \ncommunications would enable people and businesses to share data about their use of \ntelecoms services, held by their providers, with third parties who could help them \nnavigate the market and get a better deal. \n \nAs part of the ​Innovate UK R&D Programme​, the Open Data Institute (ODI) convened a \nworkshop with industry representatives to generate use cases for consumers and \nproviders and to look at the potential risks of enabling people and businesses to share \nmore information about their use of communications services. Findings from the \nworkshop included the potential to provide better products to consumers, better insights \nto service providers, while acknowledging the risks of increasing access to data. \n \nMaking a sector more open is a long journey, but the communications data ecosystem is \npoised for such a change and Ofcom will not be the first organisation to attempt a \nsector-wide open data initiative. Ofcom has been looking at similar initiatives in other \nindustries to understand what works best and what should be avoided. Importantly, \nOfcom will have to understand what combination of mandate, reward and opportunity \nneeds to be created to motivate organisations to change and ensure benefits reach as \nmany stakeholder groups as possible. \n \n  \n \n\n \nBackground  \nThe ODI works with companies and governments to build an open, trustworthy data \necosystem, where people can make better decisions using data and manage any \nharmful impacts. In November 2019, we hosted a workshop for Ofcom, the UK \ncommunications regulator, looking at the future of data sharing in the communications \nsector. \n \nThe communications data ecosystem contains data that exists on a spectrum, from \n1\nclosed, to shared, to open. Below is a graphic of ​The Data Spectrum​, produced by the \nODI. Much of the data is closed or shared in a limited manner for security and privacy \nreasons, such as security credentials and call data records (CDRs). Some data is shared \nwidely such as product information, coverage, and store location. Ofcom ​publishes open \ndata​ on a variety of topics such as fixed and mobile network coverage and the service \nquality that providers offer. \n2\n \nAn open communications initiative would seek to increase open and shared data in the \nsector in a way that maximises value for communications customers, opportunities for \ncompanies, and provides further benefits to society. This could be done by looking at \nwhat data infrastructure could become more open. When data is more open, more \npeople can access, use and share that data.  \n \n \n \n  \n1\n Open Data Institute (n.d.).

It also includes the standards and technologies used to curate \nand provide access to those data assets and the guidance and policies that inform the \nuse and management of data assets. It can also include the organisations that govern \nthe data infrastructure and has to involve the communities involved in contributing to or \nmaintaining it; and those who are impacted by decisions that are made using it.  \n3\n \nIncreased access to certain communications data infrastructure, including identifiers or \nother standards, or even the metadata to closed or shared data, could boost innovation \nin the sector that benefits customers. \n \nOther regulators and industry bodies have explored and implemented initiatives to \nincrease access to data in their sectors: \n \n●Open banking​ allows retail banking customers to share account and transaction \ndata with trusted partners. When securely shared, the data can be used to build \nuseful services such as account aggregation and personal financial \nmanagement. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is looking to expand this \n4\nto other financial data sources under the banner of open finance.  \n5\n●Open energy​ standards could help to change markets, create open ecosystems \nand implement policy objectives. It could improve consumer control over energy \ndata about them, and support the creation of innovative new energy services. \n6\n●An ​open water​ initiative could benefit all parts of the sector, allowing water \ncompanies to learn from each other, encouraging efficiency in sharing \ntechnology and increasing transparency to customers, leading to greater \ncustomer satisfaction. \n7\n●The ​OpenActive​ programme from Sport England and the ODI is currently helping \nthe sports and leisure sector adopt data standards and publish open data with \nthe hope of getting more people in England active. \n \nThere is also support from UK government initiatives for making data ecosystems as \nopen as possible: \n \n●In October 2018 HM Treasury sought views and evidence on its Digital \nCompetition Expert Panel. ​The expert panel concluded​ that data openness can \nbe used as a tool to promote competition, where it is determined this is \n3\n Dodds, L. & Wells, P.

This review proposed that greater access to telecoms data would \nfoster innovation to improve consumer outcomes by: \n○accelerating the development of innovative data-driven services in \nconsumer markets \n○using data and technology to help vulnerable consumers \n○ensuring consumers and their data are protected. \n9\n \nIn Australia the rollout of the ​Consumer Data Right​ will help give consumers greater \naccess to and control over personal data, starting with banking and gradually increasing \nto include energy, telecoms, and health. \n10\n \nOur first look into ​open APIs in the telecoms industry​ demonstrated that there is potential \nto enable new products and services that meet the needs of a wide set of users. In this \n11\ncontext, the ODI looked further into what it would take to bring more openness to \ncommunications data. \n \n  \n8\n Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (2019), “Unlocking Digital \nCompetition: Report of the Digital Competition Expert Panel”, \nhttps://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_\ndata/file/785547/unlocking_digital_competition_furman_review_web.pdf  \n9\n Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (2019), “Smart Data: Putting \nconsumers in control of their data and enabling innovation”, \nhttps://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_\ndata/file/808272/Smart-Data-Consultation.pdf  \n10\n Australian Competition & Consumer Commission (2017), “Consumer Data Right (CDR)”, \nhttps://www.accc.gov.au/focus-areas/consumer-data-right-cdr-0  \n11\n Projects by IF (2018), “Open APIs in the Telecoms Industry”, \nhttps://openapis.projectsbyif.com/  \n \n\n \nThe value of sharing \ndata \nBusinesses can create value by using third-party data to develop new products and \nservices. Our research has shown that they can unlock additional value by sharing data \nthey have collected. Increasing access to data held in the private sector has proven \n12\nbenefits to businesses in many ways, including: \n \n●Improving supply chain efficiency \n13\n●Increasing market reach \n14\n●Facilitating ​benchmarking and market insights \n15\n●Building trust \n16\n●Improving efficiencies through ​open innovation, including within ​regulated \n17\nmarkets \n18\n●Collaborating to ​address sector-wide challenges \n19\n \nOur research with the Bennett Institute at the University of Cambridge on ​the value of \ndat​a​ has shown that despite increasing access to data being an important way to unlock \nits wider economic and social benefits, there are various market failures around data and \nthe data economy that mean data sharing initiatives will not necessarily emerge on their \nown. \n20\n \n  \n12\n Open Data Institute (2020), “Report: Sharing data to create value in the private sector”, \nhttps://theodi.org/article/report-sharing-data-to-create-value-in-the-private-sector/  \n13\n Open Data Institute (2020), “Case study: The value of sharing data in supply chain optimisation”, \n ​https://theodi.org/article/case-study-the-value-of-sharing-data-in-supply-chain-optimisation/  \n14\n Open Data Institute (2020), “Case study: The value of sharing data for improving market reach”, \nhttps://theodi.org/article/case-study-the-value-of-sharing-data-for-improving-market-reach/ \n15\n Open Data Institute (2020), “Case study: The value of sharing data for benchmarking and insights”, \nhttps://theodi.org/article/case-study-the-value-of-sharing-data-for-benchmarking-and-insights/  \n16\n Open Data Institute (2020), “Case study: The value of sharing data to build trust”, \nhttps://theodi.org/article/case-study-the-value-of-sharing-data-to-build-trust/  \n17\n Open Data Institute (2020), “Case study: The value of sharing data to drive open innovation”, \nhttps://theodi.org/article/case-study-the-value-of-sharing-data-to-drive-open-innovation/  \n18\n Open Data Institute (2020), “Case study: The value of sharing data in regulated environments”, \nhttps://theodi.org/article/case-study-the-value-of-sharing-data-in-regulated-environments/  \n19\n Open Data Institute (2020), “Case study: The value of sharing data to address sector challenges”, \nhttps://theodi.org/article/case-study-the-value-of-sharing-data-to-address-sector-challenges/  \n20\n Open Data Institute & Nuffield Foundation (2020), “Valuing data: foundations for data policy”, \nhttps://www.nuffieldfoundation.org/project/valuing-data-foundations-for-data-policy  \n \n\n \nWorkshop format and \nattendance \nThe workshop hosted participants from a variety of backgrounds such as potential data \nusers, consumer advocacy groups and government. The full list of attendees is included \nin ​Appendix 1​. The workshop was convened to help better understand the potential for \nOfcom’s open communications initiative. The workshop did not include communications \nproviders as we wanted to give more space to organisations that could start to use open \ncommunications data for innovative new consumer-facing applications or have \nexperience doing this in other sectors. \n \nSelect participants were requested to give short presentations on their organisations, \nand on what an open communications initiative might mean to them. These speakers \nwere: \n \n●OpenWrks​ – an open banking service provider and potential data user under \nopen communications, who focussed on the opportunities for data users to \nprovide better services for customers through access to data from customers \nand industry. \n●Which?​ – a consumer organisation that aims to help consumers make the right \nchoices around purchases through testing and advice. They spoke of the \npotential to improve customer outcomes through increased availability to data \nand information.  \n●uSwitch​ – a price comparison and switching service for energy, personal \nfinance, insurance and communications services that saw open communications \nas a way to improve their service to customers and expand it beyond price \ncomparison. \n  \nParticipants engaged in ‘data ecosystem mapping’ to understand the current \ncommunications data ecosystem and some of its potential under open communications. \nParticipants also created example use cases in which both consumers and providers of \ncommunications services could benefit, and explored their associated risks. \n  \n \n\n \nThe communications \ndata ecosystem \nData infrastructure can be hard for people to visualise and understand. We therefore \nneed to create ways to understand the ecosystems it supports. These aid \ncommunication and enable us to make better decisions about investing in and operating \nthat infrastructure to maximise the value it provides. One approach is a ​data ecosystem \nmap​. \n \nA data ecosystem map identifies the key data stewards and users, the relationships \nbetween them and the different roles they play. In the workshop, participants created \ndata ecosystem maps to share information and discuss the current and potential \ntelecoms data ecosystem. \n \nExample mobile data ecosystem map from the workshop redrawn on kumu: \n  \n \nAll the ecosystem maps were different but they captured the complexity of the data \necosystem, with large numbers of actors playing a variety of roles in the ecosystem and \ncreating value in different ways. \n \nAll the maps highlighted two main aspects: how consumers navigate the \ncommunications market; and how different types of communications providers access \ndata and value across the ecosystem. \n \n \n\n \nA variety of other insights were highlighted by the groups through the mapping exercise \nand subsequent presentations, such as: \n \n●Valuable communications related data sits not just with mobile providers, but \nalso adjacent organisations, such as banks, transport companies, and \nregulators. \n●Customers could be incentivised to share communications data and more with \nmobile providers as well as third parties in order to improve service delivery. \n●The physical infrastructure of the ecosystem can influence the data and value \nflows of the ecosystem. \n●Mapping the data ecosystem could help new challengers identify where to \naccess data from. \n●Consumers provide data and money and often get back value in the form of \nservices and insights, but do not receive monetary compensation for providing \ndata. \n \nWith a better shared understanding of the data ecosystem they operate in, the workshop \nthen moved on to the main focus, use case generation. \n  \n \n\n \nUse cases for open \ncommunications \nWorkshop teams were asked four questions about the potential of increasing access to \ndata in the communications sector, and generated, discussed and prioritised their \nanswers. The four questions all had the same format: \n \n●What are the possible services that could have ​most benefit to \ncommunications customers? \n●What are the possible services that could have the ​most benefit to \ncommunications providers? \n●What are the possible services that could be the​ easiest to implement​ with \nincreased access to data? \n●What are the ​risks that are associated​ with possible new services? \nGreatest benefit to consumers \nThe overarching theme of what would be the greatest benefit to consumers was around \nfinding the communications products that were best suited for them. Comparing, \nswitching, aggregating and managing communications products based on their needs \nand lifestyle – such as location, commute, living situation – were seen as the greatest \nbenefits of increased access to communications data. Other priority products included \nbill splitting in shared households, unbundling services across multiple providers for the \nbest deal, and understanding usage patterns in public services.  \n \nLower priority services included: \n \n●Automated switching across service providers \n●Emergency services locator \n●Add-ons without tie-ins and shorter tie-in on contracts \n \nIn our previous work on ​Open APIs in Telecoms​ we looked at three potential use cases \nthat could benefit telecoms customers. These use cases were tested with \n21\ncommunications providers to ensure their feasibility. \n \n●Choosing a new mobile network​. Comparison sites are typically geared towards \nprice, helping people find the cheapest deal. Using data for signal strength, \nethical preferences such as carbon footprint and sourcing practices, or real data \nusage this could enable the creation of services for managing and switching \nbetween mobile network providers based on more than price. \n●Managing utility bills in a shared household​.  Most utility companies do not \noptimise for the complexity of people living together in shared houses, including \nshared responsibility for paying and managing the bills and some people \n21\n Open Data Institute (2018), “Building the future: opportunities for new services and \nstronger digital rights in telecoms and utilities”, \nhttps://theodi.org/article/building-the-future-opportunities-for-new-services-and-stronger-di\ngital-rights-in-telecoms-and-utilities/  \n \n\n \nperiodically moving. Making this data portable could help to split the bills in a \nhousehold, while allowing everyone to see all the accounts in one place. \n●Improving a city’s air quality using bulk location data from mobile phones​. Cities \nmay have rich street-level data about air quality, but can lack footfall and cyclist \ndata. Better data would help urban planners working to combat pollution to \nprioritise the streets in which the highest number of people are affected by poor \nair quality. \nGreatest benefit to providers \nIncreasing access to communications data could also benefit the organisations currently \nstewarding this data. Our research shows that private sector organisations can gain \nvalue from sharing data. In the Open Banking ecosystem, traditional banks have \nbenefitted from improved Know-Your-Customer (KYC) – the process whereby a business \nverifies the identity and suitability of their customers, the ability to create personalised \nproduct offerings, and access to competitor customer information. \n \nThere were no current representatives from communications providers present at this \nworkshop, but participants discussed how providers could benefit from improving their \nservice provision. Open communications could give communications providers a better \nunderstanding of the market by having better insights to customer preferences and \nservice use through consented data access. Service providers would potentially be able \nto compete better by providing personalised services, using competitor data to target \ncertain market segments, and improve services with non-telecoms data. \n \nLower priority services that were mentioned in this category included: \n \n●Targeting investment in networks (in infrastructure, coverage, etc.) \n●Understanding switch incentives \n●Consumer feedback mechanisms \n●Upselling to customers \n●Identifying vulnerable consumers \n●Identifying opportunities to share assets with competitors \n●Standardisation of product metrics \n \nCommunications providers are investing in new technologies that have the potential to \ngenerate large quantities of data. Analysing data generated from Internet of Things (IoT) \ndevices, software defined networks (SDNs) - the separation of network control functions \nfrom network data functions - and network function virtualization (NFV) - software \nimplementations of network functions - could provide a lot of value to communications \nproviders. Given the difficult nature of analysis however, communications companies \n22\nmay be best served using an open innovation approach that draws on external expertise. \nThis approach could be facilitated by the wider open communications initiative in similar \nways to how the Data Pitch programme was able to do so for data providers in different \nsectors. \n23\n22\n Cisco (n.d.) “SDN vs. NFV: What’s the difference?”, \nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/solutions/software-defined-networking/sdn-vs-nfv.html \n23\n London Economics (Jan 2020), “Data Pitch Evaluation”, \nhttps://datapitch.eu/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/London-Economics-Data-Pitch-evaluati\non-FINAL-PDF.pdf \n \n\n \nQuick wins \nSome services will be more difficult to implement in the market than others due to \ntechnical requirements or data privacy and sensitivity. In order to ensure continued \nmomentum and support for an open communications initiative, lower risk and more \ntechnically simple services could be implemented first.  \n \nParticipants noted that publishing some types of data could be an easy “quick win”, such \nas open standards around products, and data around geographic coverage. Groups \nalso noted that enabling people to combine their communications data with data from \nother household utilities for ease of bills management could feature in the first rollout of \nservices.  \n \nLower priority services that were mentioned in this category included: \n \n●Publishing better and more product data for Price Comparison Websites (PCWs) \n●Standard publication of usage data per service and per user \n●Make metadata available to help decide which data to share first \n●Publishing fuller information on tariffs \n \nOutside of increasing access to customer data to third parties, open communications \ncould also mandate organisations to publish open data. Ofcom and the industry should \nfocus on first publishing data that is of low risk to data providers and high benefit to \npotential users, they should consider: \n \n●Publishing data without personal information openly first removes the need for \npotentially risky anonymisation processes. \n●Publishing low risk geospatial data - data about a place, such as a building, \nriver, or city  - quickly has the additional benefit of improving the overall \ngeospatial data infrastructure of a region, with uses beyond the communications \nsector. \n●Publishing data on terms and conditions for various communications products \ncould promote consumer choice and protection but requires some \nstandardisation of product offerings. \nRisks \nIn order for a data ecosystem to be trusted it must be trustworthy. Having an \nunderstanding of the risks of increasing openness and putting in place measures to \ncombat those risks is a fundamental aspect of trustworthy data stewardship. \n \nThe results of this question were mixed across the groups but the main theme to emerge \nwas a lack of initial trust from consumers to share personal data with third parties. This \nrisk is not new when trying to implement an open data initiative and was a similar \nconcern with Open Banking. Another key set of risks were around the misuse of data \nafter being shared, a concern that can go hand in hand with low consumer trust. \n \nLower priority risks included: \n●Large costs for industry \n●Slow progress developing standards \n \n\n \n●Misleading recommendations due to incomplete sets of data being used \n●Lack of market incentives \n●Potential for unacceptable price discrimination \n \nThere are important steps that Ofcom and industry organisations can take to reduce the \nrisk and minimise harm from increasing access to data, such as: \n \n●Ensuring strict alignment to regulation around personal data such as the General \nData Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the EU, and ​using proper anonymisation \ntechniques when aggregating personal data so that it can be opened. \n24\n●Implementing data ethics assessments that go beyond compliance and legal \nissues. Tools such as the ​ODI’s Data Ethics Canvas​ can help identify and make \ndecisions about potential ethical issues. Publishing findings openly can help \nbuild trust.  \n25\n●Implementing safeguards so that incumbent communications providers do not \nunfairly benefit and that vulnerable customers are protected from harm. \n \n  \n24\n Open Data Institute (2019), “Anonymisation and open data: An introduction to managing \nthe risk of re-identification”, \nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1CoXniaTnQL_4ZyQuji9_MA_YCEElQjx4z1SEdB08c\n2M/edit#  \n25\n Open Data Institute (2019),”The Data Ethics Canvas, \nhttps://theodi.org/article/data-ethics-canvas/#1557853049317-baab6160-135f  \n \n\n \nRecommendations \nIt takes a lot of work to create an open, trustworthy data ecosystem. Ofcom is well \npositioned to begin that journey. The communications sector is poised for a data \nportability initiative, and there is interest by end users, data users and providers. There \nare other sectors to look at for inspiration and caution. Culture change in a sector \nrequires understanding the various motivations of the different actors. Ofcom will have to \nunderstand what combination of mandate, reward and opportunity needs to be created, \nand for whom, to further the goals of the initiative. \n \nOfcom should focus on the next steps in their journey so as to ensure a strong \nfoundation to move forward: \n \n●Confer with key representatives from other data portability initiatives in the \nenergy, water, and banking sectors to learn best practice and where pitfalls may \nexist \n●Seek buy-in from the industry’s main service providers to ensure a smooth \nimplementation and achievement of goals \n●Convene a working group of different industry representatives to develop a \nprogramme of activity for further discovery and implementation \n●Focus initial work on a non-contentious and low risk quick win, such as \ngeospatial data \n●Explore ways to stimulate and encourage further work on specific use cases. \nThis might involve engaging in discovery projects, funding hackdays or offering \nstimulus funding for small projects \n●Promote and sponsor further engagement and research to understand the data \necosystem better, such as a report on communications data infrastructure and \nstandards, or on an appropriate ​model for data access​, such as a ​data trust​ or \nother institution for data that cannot be openly published. \n  \n \n\n \nAppendix 1: Workshop \nAttendance \nThe following organisations had one or more members attending the workshop: \n \n●Ofcom \n●Which? \n●Bud \n●OpenWrks \n●OpenDataSoft \n●USwitch \n●DCMS \n●UK Regulators Network \n●Open Data Institute \n  \n \n\n \nAppendix 2: Additional \nResources \n●Mapping data ecosystems​ methodology and ​tool​ – a tool for documenting and \nmapping data ecosystems \n●Open APIs in the Telecoms Industry \n●The ODI’s ​Data Toolkit for Business​ is a set of collaborative tools that will help \nbusinesses unlock the value of data \n●Open standards for the UK energy sector \n●Furman Review: Access to data is a new tool against monopoly \n●Anonymisation and open data: An introduction to managing the risk of \nre-identification \n●How far Open Banking has come: our five takeaway \n●Open Standards for Data​ - This guidebook helps people and organisations \ncreate, develop and adopt open standards for data. \n●Open data for public services​ – includes example data ecosystem maps \n●Report: Sharing data to create value in the private sector \n●Data sharing in the private sector​ - includes case studies on businesses gaining \nvalue from increasing access to data they hold and a ​summary report \n●The Value of Data report​ - exploring ideas around how to effectively and ethically \ntap into the value of data \n ","version":"1.10.100"}
