This is being enabled by open \ndata –data that is available to everyone to access, \nuse and share.\nIn the longer run, we expect open data to enable the \nfull range of transport services to be fully integrated, \nthrough ‘mobility as a service’, allowing seamless \npayment and booking, and greater choice and \nconvenience. Bus services will need to feature in this \ntransport future. They already play an important part \nin the transport system, providing access to services \nin local communities, and offering economic, \nenvironmental and social benefits.\nOpen data is already being adopted by the bus \nindustry\nConsumers are increasingly using data to make \ninformed choices across a range of sectors. In the \nbus industry, open data is enabling new business \nopportunities, with examples seen around the \ncountry. The problem is that the progress in opening \nup bus data is not happening fast enough, or \nconsistently. \nGovernment wants to support the move to Bus \nOpen Data\nThe Government is working with industry to pursue \nopen data. A key part of this is the Bus Services Act, \nwhich came into force in April 2017. This enables \nGovernment to set legislation which will require \ninformation from all bus operators on timetables, \nfares and routes.\nBus open data will deliver a range of benefits \nto passengers, operators, local authorities, and \nthe wider population\nThe aim of bus open data is to provide greater \nconvenience for travellers and to facilitate bus use. \nThis will deliver benefits to operators, who have seen \nfalling demand in some areas over recent years. It will \nalso help local authorities with planning of public \ntransport provision, and enable new business models \nand innovation by opening data up to anyone who \nneeds it. This includes app developers, who can \ndevelop products for passengers to help with journey \nplanning. \nWe need collaboration to open up bus data\nThis document sets out the case for bus open data \nand calls for collaboration between Government, \noperators, local authorities, passenger groups and \ntechnology companies to work together. Each group \nwill have a role to play in opening up bus data to best \nserve all parties and deliver the widest benefits. \n\nBus Open Data\nExecutive \nsummary\n5\nBus Open Data can make \njourneys better for passengers, \naddress challenges in the \nindustry and achieve better \noutcomes.\nThe role of\nthe bus\nBenefits to \neverybody\nCollaborative \napproach\nBuses provide vital services \nfor local communities and \ndeliver substantial \nsocioeconomic benefits. \nHowever the industry is \nfacing a challenge of falling \ndemand in some areas, and \nis behind other modes on \nfare and timetable data.\nPassengers want the bus sector to \nopen up its data. This is already \nhappening, but it is not consistent, \nreliable and widespread. This is why \nGovernment is setting regulations on \nbus open data.\nWe need all parties to work together \nand adopt the required changes to \nfacilitate bus open data and to:\nWe are moving to an on-demand and \nmore convenient transport system. This \ninnovation will be driven by open data –\ndata that is available to everyone to \naccess, use and share. \nOpen data in the bus industry will support \nincreased patronage and offer benefits to \npassengers, operators, local authorities \nand wider technology companies.\nBus \nsuccess\nRole for \ndata\n1\nst\nchoice for commuters\n1\n98%\naccessible fleet\n2\nNecessary\nLow emissions\nAccessible\nOnly10%NOx \nemissions per passenger \nkm using diesel bus vs. \ndiesel car\n3\nBus data gaps\nData as an enabler\nDemand for data\n9%\nin England do not provide \nreal time bus information\n2\n46%\nof young passengers \nprimarily use Google \nMaps\n4\nPatronage up~2%\nwith real-time open data\n5\nPut the passenger first\nBe digital by default\nCollaboratively develop regulation\nPassengers\n•More convenient travel\nOperators\n•Increased revenue\nLocal authorities\n•Cost savings and \nbetter decision making\nTech companies\n•New business \nopportunities\n\nBus Open Data\nThe vision\nExecutive summary\n6\n\nBus Open Data\nPutting the \npassenger first\n7\nWe want a mobility ecosystem \nthat delivers seamless \nintermodal transportation faster, \ncheaper, cleaner, more \nresponsive and safer than today. \nThis will be enabled by open \ndata on fares and journeys \nacross all modes –data that is \navailable to everyone to access, \nuse and share\n1\n. \nPassengers need all transport options\n2,3\nDifferent transport modes have different characteristics (such as cost, speed, comfort, flexibility, availability and accessibility).\nThese characteristics are suited to different types of journey and passenger, which means that an efficient, effective and \nequitable transport system requires a blend of transport provision.\nData will play a key role in enabling lower-hassle transport services\n2\nA key enabler for effective transport integration is consistent, secure, real-time and open data on routes and fares.\nTransport integration will also need the widespread penetration of smartphones on 3G/4G/5G networks, high levels of \nconnectivity, and cashless payment.\nPassengers need these transport options to be easy to use, integrated and responsive\n2,3\nToday’s passengers have to locate, book, and pay for each mode of transportation separately, often without complete or real-\ntime fare and journey data. \nIn the longer term we are moving to ‘Mobility as a Service’, where users can receive real-time data, and plan and book door-\nto-door trips using a single app. \nCase study: Whim\n4\nSince 2016, Helsinki residents have been able to use an app called Whim to plan and pay for all modes of public and private \ntransportation within the city. In 2017, the Whim app launched a beta version in the UK (currently available in the West Midlands to \naccess bus, tram and taxi). It will shortlylaunch the app fully, providing access to a range of transport services including bus, tram, \ntrain, taxi, bicycle, car hire and others.\nThere are many apps which make it easier to book and plan journeys\n“We want to prove that we can beat the \nservice level of a car. Or at least be \ncomparable to it. We want to show that \npeople want it, not just that we can do it”\n5\nSampo Hietanen, \nMaaS Global CEO \n\nBus Open DataExecutive summary\n8\nThe context\n\nBus Open Data\nThe bus sector \ntoday\n9\nBuses are the most-used form of \npublic transport. They serve a vital \nrole within communities, \nconnecting people to key public \nservices, such as schools and \nhospitals, local amenities, and \nwork –with more people \ncommuting by bus than all other \nforms of public transport \ncombined\n1\n. Overall, there are three \ntimes as many trips in England \nmade by local bus than made by \nrail, with over 60% of public \ntransport trips made by bus\n2\n. \nBenefits of bus services\nHealth and environment\nBus use can improve air quality and deliver \nsignificant health benefits:\n•Lower pollution: A diesel bus emits 10 times \nless NOx emissions per passenger per \nkilometre compared to a diesel car\n7\n. \n•Supporting active lifestyles: Buses \nencourage passengers to walk and cycle, \nespecially for the first and last miles\n8\n. In \nresearch about the impact of concessionary \nfares on active life-styles, it was found that \n74% of the people studied participated in new \nactivities or visited new places using public \ntransport\n9\n. \n•Improving well-being through social \ninteraction: Travelling by bus provides \nopportunities for meaningful social interaction \nand a sense of belonging and visibility in the \npublic arena, with proven positive impact on \nwell-being\n10\n. \nEconomic\nBuses are an essential enabler for economic \nactivity:\n•Business activity: Buses generate an \nestimated £64bn in economic output each year. \nBuses are also the primary mode of access to \ncity centres, facilitating an estimated 29% of city \nexpenditure\n3\n. \n•Productivity: In the UK, around 400,000 people \nare estimated to be in more productive jobs as a \ndirect result of access to bus services\n3\n. Based \non average occupancy, a single bus moves 10 \ntimes as many people as a car\n3\n, and a 10% \nreduction in congestion can result in increased \neconomic productivity of 1%\n4\n. \n•Affordability: Buses provide a more affordable \ntransport option, and are around 60% cheaper \nthan commuting by car. Buses also primarily \nserve the lower income groups\n5\n.\n•Flexibility:Buses are a flexible form of public \ntransport, taking on average 56 days to set up a \nnew route, compared to years for a new train \nline\n6\n.\nSocial\nBuses support the young, the older and the \ndisabled passengers:\n•Accessible services: 98% of buses in \nEngland are accessible for wheelchair users, \nwith amenities such as boarding lifts and \nramps, wheelchair spaces and wheelchair \nrestraints\n11\n.\n•Serving those in need: There were 929 \nmillion concessionary bus journeys in England \nin 2016/17, amounting to a total of 34% of all \nlocal bus journeys and £1.13bn of \nconcessions\n12\n. \n•High satisfaction: Bus passengers are \ngenerally very satisfied with bus services (for \nexample, with 88% overall journey satisfaction \noutside London\n13\n).\n\nBus Open Data\nThe move to \ndigital services\n10\nConsumers are increasingly \nusing digital services, \nenabled by open data, across \na range of industries. \nTransport customers also \nwant information and data \ndriven services –this data \ncan lead to higher revenues \nfor operators and new \ncommercial opportunities. \nTransport customers want\n14,15,16\n:\nIntegrated information \non multi-modal journeys\nA ‘single source of \ntruth’, ideally using a \nsingle app or website\nReal-time reliable \ninformation including \ndisruption alerts\nInformation about prices \nand payment through a \nsingle platform\nThe progress on opening bus data\nOpen data already exists in the bus sector –data that is available to everyone to access, use and share. For \nexample, Traveline publishes national bus data, including timetable and real-time information where available\n6\n. \nHowever, bus data availability is often insufficient or inconsistent. 9% of buses in England do not provide real time \nbus information\n11\nto passengers and there is no single source of bus data on arrival times, real-time location, fare \nprices and ticketing\n6\n. 57% of buses are not enabled for payment by contactless bank cards\n11\n. \nOverall, a lack of open data is important because of the context of the bus industry’s patronage challenge. In \nEngland, patronage has fallen by 4% since 2009/10\n11\n, with low satisfaction amongst some passengers because they \ndo not have access to the information they need to plan their journey\n15,16\n. \nMost young passengers use a single source of information to plan their journey, with 46% using GoogleMaps and \n44% using travel websites\n16\n.\n“You don’t really know how much it will cost until you get on the bus, there is nothing to tell you how much it will be.” \nEssex, 14-16 years\n16\n\nBus Open Data\nCase Study\nRDG Darwin: \nOpen data in the \nrail industry\n17\n11\nThe Rail Delivery Group’s ‘Darwin’ is the official \nopen data hub for the British rail industry. Darwin \nprovides information from operators to all interested \nparties, including National Rail Enquiries, app \ndevelopers and external journey planning apps such \nas Trainline, fostering innovation:\n•RDG opened operators’ data, including \ntimetables, historic service performance and \nreal-time information;\n•Darwin provides better information to customers, \nincreases customer satisfaction and reduces \noperators’ operational costs;\n•Third-party developers provide additional \nservices. For example, Blackbox provides real-\ntime information at stations, and app developers \nare currently building a platform to deliver real-\ntime disruption updates to customers.\n•By opening up data at no cost to individual \ndevelopers, the rail industry has seen an \nincrease in innovation and lowering of costs for \nreal-time information signage and displays. \n\nBus Open DataExecutive summary\n12\nOpening up bus data\n\nBus Open Data\nCase Study\nReading Buses: \nDigital and data-\ndriven operator\n1\n13\nReading Buses is an early adopter of digital \nservices. It sees data as a business asset for \nnew commercial opportunities, and \nemphasises using technology to improve \ncustomer experience. \nIt has a ‘data lab’ and continuously innovates. \nFor example, it developed a tree-strike tool, \nallowing tree strikes on buses to be reported \nto the Local Authority. This innovation will \nsoon be commercialised. \nIt publishes fare data, real-time information, \nvehicle specifications and other types of data. \nCustomer satisfaction is ranked among the \nhighest in the country, at 93%, supporting \nincreased demand for bus services in the \nReading area.\n“We can see that opening our data allows \nthird parties to use and integrate our services \nwith their own ideas, improving our reach and \nhelping us to think differently too\". \nJohn Bickerton, Reading Buses\n2\n\nBus Open Data\nHow publishing \nopen data will \nwork?\n14\nDfT wants to follow a distributed model for open data\n3\nDfTwill publish data \nstandards for operators \nand build a ‘Discovery \nPortal’ (providing links \nto external websites \nand ‘application \nprogramming \ninterfaces’ and \nproviding an overview \nof available \ninformation). \nOperators will publish \ndata independently, \nthrough their website or \nAPI, through a local \nauthority ‘bureau \nservice’ or using a third \nparty technology \nprovider.\nLocal authorities can \ncontinue to provide \nbureau services to \npublish bus \ninformation. Local \nauthorities should \ncontinue to validate the \noperators’ data and \nprovide training, \nsupport and tools to \noperators where \nappropriate.\nTechnology service \nproviders can provide tools \nto operators and local \nauthorities to publish their \ndata, provide discovery \nportals with additional \nfunctionalities and use the \ndata to provide value-\nadding services to end-\nusers.\nThe process for open data –distributed model\n3\nBus\noperator\nLocal AuthorityEnd-User\nData is open to all users \nincluding Traveline, \nLocal Authorities, travel-\nplanning apps and \nregulatory bodies.\nData userDiscovery\nportal(s)\nTechnology service\nprovider\nOpen data\nEnd users receive \ninformation \nthrough third-\nparty providers\nDfT Discovery Portal \nand additional \nportals if applicable.\n\nBus Open Data\nBenefits for \neveryone (1/2)\n15\nOpen data can reduce \nuncertainty, make journeys \nmore relaxing and \nempower consumers to \nmake better decisions.

The \nmarginal costs of providing \nopen data are negligible\n12\n. \nThere are one-off set-up \ncosts for maintaining and \nvalidating data, but data \nimprovement will drive \noperational benefits, \nimprove customer \nsatisfaction and support \nlong-term growth\n3,12\n.\nIncreased patronage \nand satisfaction\nReduced operational \ncosts\nGroup\nBenefit\nExample\n\nBus Open Data\nBenefits for \neveryone (2/2)\n16\nBus open data will offer \nbenefits to local authorities \nand support innovation, \nenabling multi-modal, \nintegrated journeys and a \n‘predict and provide’ \napproach in transport.\nLocal\nAuthorities \nWider\nsociety\n“There are now over 600 apps powered by our data, \nused by 42 per cent of Londoners” \nVernon Everitt, Transport for London\n6\n“If we can get an access to source data, we can \nprovide better information to end-users, which will \neventually also benefit the operators”\nOperations Director, Global Journey-planning app\n13\nLocal Authorities (LAs) and \nPublic Transport Authorities, \nsuch as Transport for West \nMidlands, use real-time \ninformation to make \ndecisions around traffic \nmanagement and \nroadworks, and provide \ndisruption alerts\n14\n. Other \nLAs, such as Norfolk, \nincreased electronic \nregistration and published \ndata, reducing costs of \ncustomer support\n15\n. \nTfL’s open data platform \nenabled partnerships with \nmajor data and software \norganisations, providing \nmeaningful data on areas \nTfL itself does not collect \ndata, for example \ncrowdsourcing traffic data\n6\n.\nCost savings and better \ndecision making\nInnovation opportunities \nfrom partnerships\nTransport System Catapult \nestimate that improved data \nsharing could lead to \nbenefits through mobility \nsolutions of around £15bn in \nvalue, by 2025. The direct \neconomic benefits of UK \npublic sector open data \nhave been estimated as \n£8.9bn in 2016,\n12\nwhile the \ntotal impact could be around \nfour times larger when \nincluding indirect and wider \nbenefits\n16\n.\nTfL’s open data is estimated \nto directly support around \n500 jobs that would not \nhave existed otherwise. \nWith 13,000 registered \nusers, TfL enabled the \ncreation of over 600 apps, \nincluding Citymapper and \nother apps\n6\n.\nSupport innovation\nNew business \nopportunities\nGroup\nBenefit\nExample\n\nBus Open Data\nEnabling \ninnovation\n17\nOpen data allows other \ncompanies to use that data to \ndeliver new services to \npassengers. This creates new \nrevenue opportunities and \nenables innovation. For \nexample, Citymapper, one of the \nfirst journey planning apps in \nLondon, was born through open \ndata. It is now providing its own \ntransport services, and opening \nup that data for other users\n17\n.\n•What is it?: Citymapper, known for its journey \nplanning app, launched an on-demand shared \ntransport service called ‘Smart Ride’ that blurs the \nlines between buses and taxis\n19\n.\n•How does it use open data?: Citymapper’s \noperations were enabled by TfL’s open data \ndatabase\n17\n. Citymapper advocates open data and \nreleases routes, stops and schedule in GTFS format \nto support the transport data ecosystem\n20\n.\nCase study: Citymapper\n17\n•What is it?: The ArrivaClick app connects users to on-\ndemand vehicle services. The users can see the \nlocation of vehicles along the route and receive real-\ntime expected arrival time.\n•How does it use a digital approach?: ArrivaClick \nservices are enabled by an effective partnership with a \ntechnology supplier, Via, and use passengers’ location \nto calculate the most efficient route to match the \ndemand for services with supply of vehicles in real-time.\nCase study: ArrivaClick\n21\n“When TfL made its data available, there was an opportunity to design and develop a comprehensive \ntransport app, starting in the world’s most historic and iconic public transport city”.

Many LAs \nprovide training and support, back-\noffice services and tools to allow \noperators to provide better data. For \nexample, Norfolk County Council \nprovides free bus registration and a \ndata management tool to operators, \nand gradually increased electronic \nregistration to over 95% in the region. \nLocal authorities can support the move \nto open data by publishing their own \ntransport data, including additional data \nsources where available. \nThe Government will help \nensure consistency and pace in \nopening up bus data.
