You need to have permission from the owner\nof that information to do what you want to do. A licence tells you what you can do.\nBut what does it mean to license data? What requirements can a licence place on\nyou? What different licences to publishers use? How can you find out what licence\na dataset is available under? This guide answers these questions.\nNote: This guide focuses on data published by organisations based in the UK.\nLicensing law is different in different countries, so some of this information might\nnot apply to you if you are reusing information that is published elsewhere. It does\nnot address other potential legal considerations, such as compliance with the Data\nProtection Act.\nWhat Is Licensing?\nWhen someone puts care and thought into creating something, such as writing a\nblog post or taking a photograph, they own that work. This means they have the\nright to determine how it gets used.\nIf you want to use the content or data, you have to either establish that they no\nlonger have the rights to that work (because they have waived them), or ask their\npermission to use it. Licences are how they explicitly give you permission to use\ntheir work.\nWhat Do Publishers Own?\nIn Europe, there are two kinds of rights that publishers — organisations or\ni di id  l  h   kil blt  t  d tithith t th\nKnowledge & opinion > Guides >\n\n27/10/2022, 14:07Reuser’s Guide to Open Data Licensing – The ODI\nhttps://theodi.org/article/reusers-guide-to-open-data-licensing/2/8\nindividuals who make available content or data — are given over things that they\nhave created:\nthey get copyright over works (content) that they create and which are\noriginal to them, such as text that they write or photographs they take\nthey get a database right over collections of data that they have put a\nsubstantial effort into obtaining, verifying or presenting\nNote: As far as we know the database right is unique to the European Union. In\nsome countries there may be no protection for collections of data.\nIf someone applies original judgement in putting together a database, for example\nin choosing which items to include within the database or which information about\nthem to include, they have a copyright over that database, because it is a creative\nwork.\nFor example, if someone were to build a database about the best 100 cars, this\nmight involve:\nchoosing which cars count as the best cars\nwriting a description about each car\nresearching and gathering facts about them\nThey would have copyright over the database, because they chose which cars\nwere “best”. They would have copyright over the descriptions, because they wrote\nthem. And they would probably have the database right for the database they’ve\nbuilt, because they put substantial effort into gathering information about the cars.\nImportantly, they don’t own the facts about the cars — you or anyone else could\nbuild your own database containing exactly those facts without violating their\ndatabase right — but no one else can reuse their database or their descriptions\nwithout their permission because they own the copyright over them.\nPublishers probably do not have a database right if they create the facts in a\ndatabase, as opposed to gathering them from elsewhere, unless they put\nsubstantial effort into verifying or presenting the database. For example, if someone\nowns a restaurant and creates a database of the dishes that they offer, and when\nthey offer them, they probably do not have a database right over that database,\nthough they might have copyright because of the creative judgement involved in\nworking out which dishes should be offered on particular days to provide a\nbalanced menu.\nWhat About Data From Third Parties?\nPublishers might not own all the content or data that they publish themselves. In\nparticular, rather than creating the content or gathering the data themselves, some\nof the content and data they publish might be:\ncompletely licensed by them from someone else\ninclude an extract of content or data that they have licensed from someone\n\n27/10/2022, 14:07Reuser’s Guide to Open Data Licensing – The ODI\nhttps://theodi.org/article/reusers-guide-to-open-data-licensing/3/8\nelse\nbe derived from the content or data that they have licensed from someone else\nWhen they publish the data, the publisher should tell you about which content or\ndata is owned by another organisation, and under which licence it is being\nrepublished.\nWhat About Brands?\nBrands are usually protected through a trade mark. A trade mark restricts how you\ncan use an organisation’s logo or company name. They will also have copyright on\nthe logo.\nLicences for content or data usually explicitly exclude logos and company names,\nso you cannot, for example, adapt a logo by changing the colours used within it.\nYou also cannot use the company name or logo to lend weight to your product\nwithout permission to do so. However, the attribution requirements of a licence may\nrequire you to use the company name and logo to indicate that you have reused\ndata owned by that company.\nWhat Can’t You Do?\nThere are a few things that you can do with content or data without a licence, but in\ngeneral you need to be given a licence by a publisher if you want to reuse their\ncontent or data. Having access to some content or data — for example by\ndownloading it from a publisher’s website — does not give you the right to reuse it.\nRepublishing and Adding Value\nYou do not automatically have the right to republish, in its entirety, content or data\nthat someone else owns, even if they have given you a licence to use it yourself.\nYou need to check the terms of the licence for the content or data to make sure that\nyou can republish it.\nThe same applies if you are adding value to the content or data, for example by\nautomatically adding links or styling to content, or adding columns with extra\ninformation into a dataset. The new content or data includes the entirety of\nsomeone else’s content or data, so you cannot publish it unless you have their\npermission.\nPublishing Extracts\nYou have the right to publish extracts of content or databases that you have access\nto, regardless of what the licence says, so long as the extract is not “substantial”.\nHowever, it is often hard to tell if the extract that you have made is “substantial”.\nThe licence that you have been given might let you republish any amount of the\ncontentor data (open licencesdo this) Otherwiseyou shouldtake legal advice\n\n27/10/2022, 14:07Reuser’s Guide to Open Data Licensing – The ODI\nhttps://theodi.org/article/reusers-guide-to-open-data-licensing/4/8\ncontent or data (open licences do this). Otherwise, you should take legal advice\nabout whether the extracts that you want to publish are likely to count as\nsubstantial or not.\nPublishing Derived Content or Data\nYou might want to create new content or databases by adapting, deriving, or\notherwise processing some content or data. To do that, you first have to ensure you\nhave been given a licence to use the data in the first place. You then need to look\nat what the licence says about creating derived works.\nFor example, say you have been given a licence to use a photograph on your\nwebsite. You could create a new version of that photograph by changing it from\ncolour to black & white, or by adding a speech bubble to it.\nIn this case, the photograph is a creative work, and the person who took it owns the\ncopyright. Because the photograph is protected by copyright, you can only create\nthese new images if the licence under which you are using the photograph allows\nyou to do so.\nCopyright can exist in small pieces of content, such as phrases. For example, if you\nanalyse some content to create a new database, you should make sure that you\nhave the right to reuse any snippets of content that you might keep in the new\ndatabase. If the content includes a presentation of data from a database, you have\nto consider database rights as well: scraping data from the page might equate to\ncreating an extract.\nDatabase rights are slightly different, because they only extend to creating extracts\nor re-utilising (republishing) a database.\nFor example, say you analysed the data about prescriptions of each drug within\neach GP practice within the UK, along with other data about the coverage of each\npractice, to create a new dataset that provided the average spend per patient of\neach practice. So long as you had no separate contractual obligations to the\nowners of the two datasets you have brought together, you might well be free to do\nwhat you liked with the result, as it would not be possible to reconstruct the original\ndatabases from the aggregated data.\nWhat Do Licences Say?\nLicences tell you what you can do with the content or data that you access. A\nlicence will tell you whether you can:\nrepublish the content or data on your own website\nderive new content or data from it\nmake money by selling products that use it\nrepublish it while charging a fee for access\nMany licenceswill let you accesscontentor data for free but say that you cannot\n\n27/10/2022, 14:07Reuser’s Guide to Open Data Licensing – The ODI\nhttps://theodi.org/article/reusers-guide-to-open-data-licensing/5/8\nMany licences will let you access content or data for free, but say that you cannot\nrepublish it or adapt it, or use it within commercial products. If you break the terms\nof the licence, the owner of the content or data can take you to court.\nWhat Do Open Licences Say?\nAn open licence is one that places very few restrictions on what you can do with\nthe content or data that is being licensed.\nAccording to the Open Definition, There are only two kinds of restrictions that an\nopen licence can place:\nthat you must give attribution to the source of the content or data\nthat you must publish any derived content or data under the same licence (this\nis called share-alike)\nAn open licence might do neither or one or both of these. So, you might encounter\ncontent or data available under one of three levels of licence:\n1. a public domain licence has no restrictions at all (technically, these indicate\nthat the rights owner has waived their rights to the content or data)\n2. an attribution licence just says that you must give attribution to the publisher\n3. an attribution & share-alike licence says that you must give attribution and\nshare any derived content or data under the same licence\nHow Do You Provide Attribution?\nYou should provide attribution even if the licence does not require it. Giving\nattribution is a way of recognising both the efforts that the publisher has made to\nput together the content or data you are reusing, and their generosity in making it\navailable for reuse.\nWhen content or data is licensed using a licence that includes attribution, the\npublisher might specify:\nwhat wording the attribution should include\nwhere and how the attribution should be presented\nYou should follow what the publisher asks you to do. If it is not practical, for\nexample if you are providing a service that does not have room for the attribution\nstatement that they request, then get in touch with them to ask what to do.\nIt is good practice to provide the name of the organisation that published the data\nor content, and a link to their home page. Specifying the name of the dataset and\nproviding a link to its location also helps other reusers to find the data you are\nreusing.\nIf you are building a tool that reuses some content or data, you should try to include\nattribution on every page or screen in which the content or data is used. If this is\n\n27/10/2022, 14:07Reuser’s Guide to Open Data Licensing – The ODI\nhttps://theodi.org/article/reusers-guide-to-open-data-licensing/6/8\nimpractical (for example because you are pulling together information from lots of\ndifferent sources), you should provide a clear link to a page or screen that then\nprovides attribution information.\nIf you are republishing data or content, its reusers are still bound by the attribution\nrequirements of the original data or content. To make it easier for them to\nunderstand and fulfil those requirements, it is good practice to include the\nattribution for the source data or content in the attribution that you ask for. This\nmight sometimes be impractical, for example because you are creating derived\ndata or content includes data or content from a large number of sources. In these\ncases, you should provide a full list of the sources and request an attribution which\nlinks to that list.\nHow Do You Share-Alike?\nA share-alike licence requires you to republish new content or data that you create\nusing the given content or data under the same, share-alike licence. Creating new\nways of presenting data does not count as derivation or adaptation, but combining\ntwo sets of data to create a new set probably does.\nPublishing the content and data that you create from open data, as open data, is a\ngood thing to do even if the licence does not require it. Opening up your content\nand data enables others to reuse and build on your work, and can add value to\nyour work.\nWhat Open Licences Are There?\nThere are two sets of open licences that you may encounter.\nOpen Licences for Creative Content\nCreative content, such as text, photographs, slides and so on, may be licensed\nusing a Creative Commons Licence. There are three of these that you might\nencounter:\nLevel of LicenceCreative Commons Licence\npublic domainCC0\nattributionCC-by\nattribution & share-alikeCC-by-sa\nThere are different versions for each of these licences, the most recent being\nversion 4.0. There are also different variants which take into account differences in\nthe law in different countries. The links in the table above are to the version 4.0\nversions, which apply internationally, but you may find publishers using other\nversions. You can reuse content under these licences no matter what country you\nare in.\nThereare other types of CreativeCommonslicencesthat are not open licences\n\n27/10/2022, 14:07Reuser’s Guide to Open Data Licensing – The ODI\nhttps://theodi.org/article/reusers-guide-to-open-data-licensing/7/8\nThere are other types of Creative Commons licences that are not open licences.\nFor example, the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial licence does not\nallow commercial reuse of content, and therefore is not an open licence. The\nhuman-readable summaries of the Creative Commons licences spell out exactly\nwhat you can do under each licence.\nOpen Licences for Databases\nYou might encounter a similar set of licences which is available for databases from\nthe Open Data Commons. There are again three levels:\nLevel of LicenceOpen Data Commons Licence\npublic domainPDDL\nattributionODC-by\nattribution & share-alikeODbL\nOther Licences\nThere are other licences that enable reuse and which you may encounter,\nparticularly around public sector information:\nOpen Government Licence is an attribution licence that covers both copyright\nand database right and is mainly used for information made available by UK\ncentral government\nOS Open Licence is an attribution licence that is exactly the same as the\nOpen Government Licence but ensures that the attribution is to the Ordnance\nSurvey\nHow is the Licence Indicated?\nThe licence under which information is published should be clear both in human-\nreadable content and as machine-readable data. If you cannot work out the licence\nfor information that you discover on the web, you should contact the owner of the\nsite to ask: the lack of licensing information means that you cannot assume the\nright to reuse the content or data.\nHuman-readable descriptions and marks that you may encounter are shown on the\nCreative Commons and Open Data Commons websites:\nCreative Commons licence chooser\nOpen Data Commons licences\nWhere possible, the publisher should have embedded information about the licence\ndirectly within the content or data itself. Often, however, you will have to look at the\npage from which you access the content or data, or the licence information for the\nentire website, which is often linked to from the footer of the page.\nIf a publisher adds their dataset to a catalog, such as data.gov.uk or the Data Hub,\nthey may indicate the licence under which the dataset is available in the metadata\nsupplied by the catalog. You should check that this is consistent with any licence\n\n27/10/2022, 14:07Reuser’s Guide to Open Data Licensing – The ODI\nhttps://theodi.org/article/reusers-guide-to-open-data-licensing/8/8\n      \nCreative Commons Licence\nOpen Data Institute, 5th Floor, Kings Place, 90 York Way, London N1 9AG\nPrivacy policy Contact us\nppygy\ninformation they supply on their own site or within the data itself: if it is not, you\nshould ask them for clarification.\nFurther Reading\nOpen Data Commons Licensing FAQ\nAcknowledgements\nVery many thanks to Francis Davey, Leigh Dodds, Tony Hirst, and the anonymous\ncommenters who contributed comments on this draft.","version":"1.10.100"}
