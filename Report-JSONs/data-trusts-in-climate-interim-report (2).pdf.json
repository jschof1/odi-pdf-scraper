Data trusts and other forms of ‘bottom-up’ data stewardship \nhave emerged to reverse this trend and empower people to take part in the data economy. \nThis  report  sets  out  the  work  undertaken  for  the  project  ‘Data  trusts  in  climate’,  completed  between  \nNovember  2021  and  March  2022.  The  project  was  commissioned  by  the  Global  Partnership  on  Artificial  \nIntelligence  (GPAI)  and  delivered  in  partnership  by  the  Open  Data  Institute  (ODI)  and  Aapti  Institute,  with  \nsupport from the Data Trusts Initiative. It consisted of a literature review, expert interviews and a co-design \nprocess involving more than 50 organisations from around the world. \nWe articulate a design for a London Cycling Data Trust, describing how it could interact with the cycling \ncommunity, be legally incorporated, the technologies it could use and its options for funding. We found that \ndata trusts will be less feasible in other contexts and difficult to apply for a variety of reasons, including ones \nof cultural, technological and economic nature. We set out lessons learned from exploring data trusts for small \nshareholder farming in India and for indigenous climate migration in Peru. \nThis work has produced a set of generic feasibility criteria for data trusts, which are intended for use by \npolicymakers and practitioners seeking to understand where data trusts may be necessary and possible, in \nclimate change and beyond. It also sets out a practical roadmap for the development of a London Cycling \nData Trust and other similar data trusts, outlining the steps required to implement it in the real world. \nWe also discuss other approaches to responsible data stewardship for AI, and options for GPAI and other \npolicymakers interested in this agenda. \nAs  in  all  progress  around  new  approaches  to  data  stewardship,  it  is  essential  to  test  these  ideas  further.   \nThis project is another step forward for data trusts, but much more is required to unlock their potential. \n  \n \n1 \nUnited Nations Environment Programme, ‘Facts about the climate emergency’,. https://www.unep.org/explore-topics/climate-\naction/facts-about-climate-emergency  \n\nEnabling Data Sharing for Social Benefit Through Data Trusts: Data Trusts in Climate \n5 \n \n1. Introduction \nThe objective of this project was to assess the opportunity to create data trusts that would facilitate action to \ntackle climate change and, if feasible, produce a roadmap for the development of a real-world data trust in a \nvital climate domain. It is the latest in the GPAI’s efforts to enable data sharing for social benefit through data \ntrusts, and builds on previous work\n2\n undertaken by the ODI, Aapti Institute and Data Trusts Initiative to explore \ntheir potential. \nWe  set  out  to  help  bridge  the  gap  between  the theory  and  practice  of  data  trusts.  What  could  data  trusts   \nlook  like  in  the  wild  and  how  would  they  interact  with  different  communities  to  address  pressing  climate   \nissues? What are the key barriers and frictions that would need to be overcome to develop them? This report \nshares our findings. \nIn Section 2, we provide a backdrop, discussing the role of data and artificial intelligence in understanding \nand  tackling  climate  change.  We  contextualise  data  trusts  as  a  promising  approach  to  ‘bottom-up’  data \nstewardship, where individuals and communities are empowered to control how data about them is collected, \nused and shared, and provide a summary of the latest discourse on the concept.  \nDrawing  from  the  core  functions  of  the  approach  identified  by  GPAI’s  Data  Governance  Working  Group  in  \n2021, we document the criteria developed and used to assess the feasibility of data trusts in Section 3. Given \ndata  trusts  exist  as  a  mode  of  stewardship  designed  to  empower  communities  around  data,  these   \nfeasibility criteria are anchored around a community’s readiness and ability to engage. We intend for others \nto use this as a general framework to understand where data trusts may be useful in the near-term, in climate \nchange and beyond. \nDesigning  data  stewardship  arrangements  is  contextual,  dependent  on  different  and  specific  dynamics,   \nissues  and  needs.  In  Section  4,  we  document  the  results  of  our  work  to  design  and  assess  the  feasibility   \nof applying data trusts to three different climate domains: city sustainability, small shareholder farming and \nclimate  migration.  This  work  followed  a  process  of  co-design,  whereby  experts  in  these  domains  and  data   \nstewardship  came  together  to  explore  what  data  trusts  could  look  like,  using  collaborative  design  frame- \nworks and methodologies.  \nBased on our positive assessment of its feasibility, we build out a roadmap for the development of the London \nCycling Data Trust – also applicable to other locales – in Section 5. The roadmap includes steps covering the \nessential elements of community, capacity, legal and governance, technology, and scale and sustainability. \nLike any roadmap, the reality of building the data trust will be messier, more difficult and less linear than we \nset  out,  but  we  hope  it  describes  to  GPAI  and  other  stakeholders  the  nature  of  the  interventions  required   \non their behalf. \nIn Section 6, we share broader conclusions from this work, including on the feasibility and next steps for the \nthree climate domains, the process of co-design and the general feasibility of data trusts. We also discuss \nother  approaches  to  responsible  data  stewardship  for  AI,  and  options  for  GPAI  and  other  policymakers  \ninterested in data stewardship.  \nMore  information  about  this  research,  along  with  the  methodology  used  and  a  bibliography,  can  be  found  \nas appendices.  \n \n2 \nAapti Institute and The Open Data Institute (2022), “Enabling data sharing for social benefit through data trusts”. \nhttps://gpai.ai/projects/data-governance/data-trusts/enabling-data-sharing-for-social-benefit-through-data-trusts.pdf \n \n\nEnabling Data Sharing for Social Benefit Through Data Trusts: Data Trusts in Climate \n6 \n \n2. Climate Change, Artificial Intelligence and Data Trusts \n2.1 The Role of Data in Understanding and Tackling Climate Change \nIn  1856,  Eunice  Foote  determined  that  increasing  concentrations  of  ‘carbonic  acid  gas’  in  the  atmosphere  \nwould lead to a global warming of the climate. Working under the constraints of her time, Foote collected data \nto compare the temperature of exhausted and condensed air under differing exposures to the sun's rays to \ndemonstrate how an atmosphere with higher carbonic acid gas would warm the earth\n3\n. \nIn  the  time  between  Foote’s  experiments  and  the  writing  of  this  report,  human  activities  have  raised  \natmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide by almost 49%\n4\n. Scientists predict that this trend will lead to a \ncontinued warming of the planet and many significant effects, some of which are already occurring. These \ninclude more droughts and heat waves, stronger hurricanes and tropical storms, rising sea levels and loss of \narctic  sea  ice.  The  Intergovernmental  Panel  on  Climate  Change  (IPCC)  has  recently  described  how  these  \nchanges  will  directly  impact  human  life,  highlighting  increased  climate  migration,  food  and  agricultural  \ninsecurity, water scarcity and disease transmission\n5\n. \nJust as Foote demonstrated more than 160 years ago, data has a vital role to play in helping us understand \nand tackle these impacts to our planet and humanity. GPAI’s Responsible AI Working Group describes how \nsignificant advancements in the field of artificial intelligence – ‘any computer algorithm that makes predictions, \nrecommendations or decisions on the basis of a defined set of objectives’\n6\n – have made yet more possible \nwith data.\n7\n GPAI’s Responsible AI Working Group identifies four ways\n8\n   in which data and AI are being used \nto support climate understanding and action: \n• distilling raw data into actionable information. For example, the UK’s Office for National \nStatistics (ONS) generates insights from large transportation datasets to inform the development \nof pedestrian-friendly infrastructure, improved public transport measures and a transition to ultra-\nlow emissions vehicles.\n9\n  \n• optimising complex systems. For example, ThermaFY is applying artificial intelligence to identify \nenergy inefficiencies in buildings’ heating and cooling systems, helping to reduce their \nemissions.\n10\n \n \n3 \nFoote, E.

For example, in Brazil, Imazon is using \nartificial intelligence to identify deforestation zones in the Amazon, and assist government \nagencies in protecting and conserving the rainforest.\n11\n \n• improving predictions. Many governments around the world are using data to better predict and \nprepare for extreme weather events, including periods of drought, extreme cold or heat, hurricanes \nand cyclones.\n12,13\n \nHowever, despite the positive advancements of data and AI in this field and the wider data economy, one can \nobserve two inter-related phenomena: ‘data hoarding’ and ‘data fearing’\n14\n. \n‘Data hoarding’ relates to a scenario where organisations restrict access to data due to misperceptions about \nits value or the risks associated with data sharing. The benefits of data collection and use are only enjoyed by \na  few,  while  the  negative  impacts  of  its  use  affect  society  as  a  whole.\n15\n  In  their  report  on  the  digital  \ncommonwealth,  Mathew  Lawrence  and  Laurie  Laybourn-Langton  argue  that  the  power  of  data  and  AI  is  \nconcentrated in the hands of the few in the current digital economy, and that ‘without action, the boundless \nambition of the universal platforms threatens to undermine democracy, accelerate inequality and concentrate \neconomic power’\n16\n. \nThe scenario of ‘data fearing’ describes how data might not be collected or used to the extent it could, due  \nto  concerns  about  the  harm  that  it  can  cause  people  being  left  unaddressed.\n17\n  People  might  avoid  using  \nservices, or withdraw consent for data to be collected, which means that we end up missing data and the uses \nof  it  that  could  support  human  flourishing.  In  the  report  ‘Digital  technology  and  the  planet:  harnessing  \ncomputing to achieve net zero’\n18\n, the Royal Society set out how new technologies could be used to address \nthe challenges to privacy and security that deploying AI to the climate crisis can encounter. It also outlined the \nneed to ensure that the positive impacts generated from data use in this context are felt by those who have \noriginated the data. \nThese phenomena have problematic consequences in terms of making use of data and AI in the battle against \nclimate change. For example, a lack of accessibility to proprietary mobility data sets – driven by organisations \nhoarding data they hold – has impacted our ability to adequately track carbon emissions.\n19\n Elsewhere, smart \nmeter users have withdrawn consent for data to be shared, due to concerns that it would be used to identify \n \n11 \nMicrosoft: AI for Earth, ‘Imazon’, https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/ai/ai-for-earth-imazon  \n12 \nHickey, H (2020 December 15), ‘A.I. model shows promise to generate faster, more accurate weather forecasts’, \nhttps://www.washington.edu/news/2020/12/15/a-i-model-shows-promise-to-generate-faster-more-accurate-weather-forecasts/   \n13 \nRichmond, S.

While data and AI alone \nwill not solve the climate crisis, improving access to data could help provide valuable insights to policymakers, \ncommunities and organisations in the efforts to respond to it. \n2.2 The Emergence of Bottom-Up Data Stewardship \nThe  concept  of  data  stewardship  is  a  response  to  these  ‘data  hoarding’  and  ‘data  fearing’  scenarios.  Data  \nstewardship can be understood as an approach to data governance that aims to unlock the societal value of \ndata,  while  responsible  and  rights-preserving  in  nature.\n21\n  More  specifically,  the  idea  of  ‘bottom-up  data  \nstewardship’ is a tonic to the typical exclusion of individuals and communities from data collection, use and \nsharing.\n22\n  Bottom-up  data  stewardship  recognises  individuals  and  communities  as  more  than  recipients  of  \ninformation – or mere providers of consent – about how data about them is used,\n23\n and seeks to empower \nthem to participate in the process of data collection, use and sharing. \nAn ecosystem of research and practice has emerged around this concept of ‘bottom-up data stewardship’. \nThe MyData Global community, for example, is set out ‘to empower individuals by improving their right to self-\ndetermination regarding their personal data’.\n24\n The Mozilla Data Futures Lab was launched in 2021 to support \nexperimentation  around  ‘new  approaches  to  data  stewardship  that  give  greater  control  and  agency  to  \npeople’.\n25\n The Ada Lovelace Institute advocates for ‘participatory data stewardship’, where people whose data \nis  used,  or  about  which  data  decisions  are  taken,  are  meaningfully  involved.\n26\n  Aapti  Institute’s  work  at  the  \nData Economy Lab\n27\n aims to empower individuals and communities to play a bigger part in data governance, \nand it has documented numerous examples of this in practice.\n28\n The Data Trusts Initiative is supporting pilot \nprojects that create bottom-up data stewardship mechanisms to serve their communities.\n29\n \nA number of promising data stewardship initiatives have emerged to enable groups to generate or repurpose \ndata about them, and exert collective control over it for a common purpose. For instance: \n• Variant Bio\n30\n works with historically marginalised populations to facilitate people-driven \ntherapeutics, where communities are engaged prior to the beginning of research projects  \nand their data is collected and used within a framework that focalises community concerns. \n \n20\n Opus Energy.

The community \npools data about air quality from all over the world to create an open environmental dataset. \nThese  examples  of  data  stewardship,  focused  on  empowering  individuals  to  exert  more  control  over  data,  \noffer inspiration for the role that data trusts could play in tackling the climate crisis. However, despite their vast \npotential, there are few examples and most initiatives of this type are limited in scale and focus on citizen-\nscience – there remains significant work to explore further climate contexts where they can be applied. \n2.3 Data Trusts \nThe concept of ‘data trusts’ can be seen against this backdrop of bottom-up data stewardship. Although there \nhave been varying interpretations of the term\n37\n, the idea of extracting value from data and restructuring its \ndistribution through the use of data trusts was posited by Professor Neil Lawrence in 2016,\n38\n who noted data \ntrusts could act as ‘power brokers’ to mediate the use of data for public benefit, without compromising the \nrights of the data subjects to whom the data relates.  \n  \n \n31 \nDriver’s Seat Cooperative LCA,  https://driversseat.co/  \n32 \nOpen Humans Foundation, https://www.openhumans.org/  \n33 \nSnaith, B. & Massey, J.

(2016 June 3). “Data trusts could allay our privacy fears”. https://www.theguardian.com/media-\nnetwork/2016/jun/03/data-trusts-privacy-fears-feudalism-democracy \n\nEnabling Data Sharing for Social Benefit Through Data Trusts: Data Trusts in Climate \n10 \n \nSubsequently, Professor Sylvie Delacroix and Lawrence articulated ‘bottom-up data trusts’ in 2019\n39\n as a tool \nof collective engagement used by communities to decide on how their data is used and shared by third parties. \nThey described how trustees could be bound by fiduciary obligations of undivided loyalty and care towards its \nbeneficiaries,  defining  the  terms  for  purpose-led  data  sharing.  The  Data  Trusts  Initiative  builds  on  this  \nconception of data trusts\n40\n. It describes them as a ‘mechanism for individuals to pool their data rights into an \norganisation’\n41\n to rebalance the respective control that corporations and individuals have over personal data, \nand provide a legal mechanism to empower data subjects to choose to appoint others to make those decisions \non their behalf. \nSimilarly, Aapti’s interpretation of a data trust refers to ‘a legal arrangement wherein a person authorises an \nindividual or entity to manage certain property for the benefit of a third party or for certain defined purposes’.\n42\n \nIn the context of the data economy, the data (or rights over it) constitutes the property\n43\n that will be managed \nby the trust and the trustee (an authorised representative individual or entity) is bound by fiduciary obligations \nto act in the best interests of its beneficiaries and according to the defined purposes.  \nGPAI’s  Data  Governance  Working  Group  is  advancing  the  understanding  and  application  of  data  trusts,   \nbased on their potential to ‘expand access to data for innovation while putting citizen interests at the heart  \nof stewardship’.\n44\n \nFunctionally speaking, GPAI’s Data Governance Working Group has described  \nthat data trusts:\n45\n \n1.   provide a platform for collectives to establish desirable terms and conditions  \nof data use, setting the constitution of a trust; \n2.   appoint expert trustees (professional managers) to take responsibility  \nfor the stewardship of the trust’s assets; \n3.   create a regime of strong fiduciary responsibilities to bind the trustees to act  \nin the interests of the trust’s members; \n4.   negotiate the use of trust assets in accordance with agreed terms and conditions,  \nfacilitating safe and controlled data use;  \n5. establish safeguards and oversight mechanisms to prevent data misuse and to take  \nremedial action in the event of the trust’s terms and conditions being breached. \n \n39 \nDelacroix, S. & Lawrence, N.

The research found general optimism \nabout the potential of data trusts (particularly in Europe and North America). However, despite encountering \nseveral other real-world bottom-up data stewardship initiatives, it found no examples of data trusts that were \nable to deliver all of the functions listed above. While existing initiatives do provide platforms for communities \nto pool data and place safeguards and oversight mechanisms around its use, the role of trustees in enabling \ndata stewardship remains a difficult function to operationalise.\n47\n In parallel, Aapti Institute was commissioned \nby  GPAI  to  examine  the  existing  and  necessary  legal  mechanisms  required  to  develop  data  trusts.\n48\n  This \nanalysis found a disparity in the maturity of legal landscapes for data trusts around the globe, and the need to \nexplore diverse legal structures for enabling data trusts and other forms of data stewardship. \nThere are a number of domains where data could support the development of AI and where that data could \nbe  subject  to  the  control  of  individuals.  Data  trusts  are  worth  investigating  as  providing  a  vehicle  for  \ncommunities to do this around climate issues, under a regime of strong fiduciary protections.  \n \n \n46 \nAapti Institute and The Open Data Institute (2022), ‘Enabling data sharing for social benefit through data trusts’, \nhttps://gpai.ai/projects/data-governance/data-trusts/enabling-data-sharing-for-social-benefit-through-data-trusts.pdf  \n47 \nIbid. \n48 \nIbid. \n\nEnabling Data Sharing for Social Benefit Through Data Trusts: Data Trusts in Climate \n12 \n \n3. Criteria for Assessing the Feasibility of Data Trusts \nThis project sought to assess the feasibility of data trusts in the context of pressing climate issues. Through \nthis  work,  we  learnt  that  feasibility  is  a  function  of  a  number  of  factors,  many  of  which  relate  to  the  \ncharacteristics  of  the  community  needed  to  create  and  sustain  it.  We  have  structured  these  as  the   \nfollowing questions: \n1. Is there an incentive for the community to come together to create a data trust? \nAs a mode of bottom-up data stewardship, a group of motivated individuals need to come together around a \ncommon purpose or cause that can be addressed by a data trust. The incentive could be based on financial \nreturn, reciprocal value exchange or altruism. \n2. Do members of the community have the capacity to engage in the development  \nand running of a data trust? \nAs well as coalescing around a cause, a data trust requires individuals to actively participate by delegating \ntheir data or rights to it. Not all groups of individuals will have the awareness, skills or time to engage and \nparticipate to this extent, both in the setting up of a data trust and in the running of it. \n3. Is there a person, group or organisation who can credibly drive the development  \nof a data trust with the community? \nIn the spirit of bottom-up/participatory data stewardship, the process of building a data trust should be led by \nsomeone  from  or  with  a  strong  connection  to  the  community.  They  may  have  a  role  to  play  in  building  \nawareness, educating, upskilling and organising. While organisations like GPAI can seek to provide inspiration \nand even facilitate, contextual expertise, credibility and leadership is important. \n4. Is there demand for the data among prospective users, with clearly bound use cases for it? \nMore data isn’t always better\n49\n. If the purpose of a data trust is to enable access to data – and importantly, to \nsafeguard the rights of, and distribute value back to, those contributing it – then the intended data users, use \ncases  and  impacts  of  the  data’s  use  should  be  clearly  articulated.  If  similar  data  is  available  from  other  \nsources, then it should also be clear why users would seek to access it via the data trust.  \n5. Are there data rights in the jurisdiction that individuals from the community  \ncould delegate to the data trust? \nA data trust is designed to steward data on behalf of a community. This requires the existence of legal data \nrights  that  individuals  can  delegate  to  a  data  trust  to  execute  on  their  behalf,  as  well  as  the  right  to  data  \nportability,  which  may  be  needed  to  repurpose  data  from  existing  sources  as  part  of  the  data  trust’s  \nstewardship  activities.  As  previous  research  by  Aapti  Institute  has  shown,  there  is  a  variance  in  access  to  \nthese rights internationally.\n50\n  \n6. Are there legal instruments in the jurisdiction that could be used to construct  \na data trust and establish fiduciary obligations to the community? \nIn contrast to other forms of bottom-up data stewardship, a data trust is designed to hold contextual, specific \nfiduciary duties to the community who have originated the data. To impart them, this requires the existence of \nappropriate legal forms or constructs, such as trusts, charities and other organisational forms. \n \n49 \nColdicutt, R. (2019), ‘Just enough Internet: Why public service Internet should be a model of restraint’, \nhttps://doteveryone.org.uk/2019/10/just-enough-internet/ \n50  \nAapti Institute and The Open Data Institute (2022), ‘Enabling data sharing for social benefit through data trusts’, \nhttps://gpai.ai/projects/data-governance/data-trusts/enabling-data-sharing-for-social-benefit-through-data-trusts.pdf  \n \n\nEnabling Data Sharing for Social Benefit Through Data Trusts: Data Trusts in Climate \n13 \n \n7. Is it technologically possible for the data trust to exert control over the data  \nit would be responsible for? \nWhile we don’t see an absence of technology as a particular barrier to setting up a data trust, there will be \nvarying levels of technological feasibility.\n51\n Important factors include whether the data trust actually holds data \non  behalf  of  the  community,  and  whether  the  data  already  exists  or  needs  to  be  collected  –  and  if  it  does  \nalready exist, whether there is infrastructure that enables it (or at least access to it) to ‘flow’ to the data trust \nand/or prospective data users. \n8. Is there access to sufficient funding to set up the data trust, and options  \nto ensure its continued sustainability? \nSetting  up  and  running  a  data  trust  will  require  funding,  including  to  build  interfaces  with  those  who  will  \ncontribute data, develop technological systems to securely hold and provide access to it, and recompense \ntrustees. Options for funding could include philanthropic donors and other actors aligned with its purpose, or \ncharging data users for licences to access data and other services. \nWe intend for this feasibility criteria to be useful to others considering whether a data trust – and with some \nadaptation, other forms of bottom-up data stewardship – is suitable in their context. \n  \n \n51 \nFor further reflections on relevant technical infrastructures and technical design choices associated with different \nforms of data trust, see: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ol3kY1NhEjE  \n\nEnabling Data Sharing for Social Benefit Through Data Trusts: Data Trusts in Climate \n14 \n \n4. Data Trusts for Climate \nIn this section, we document the results of our work to co-design and assess the feasibility of applying data \ntrusts within: city sustainability, small shareholder farming and climate migration. The three data trusts were \nco-designed  with  experts  from  across  the  three  domains  –  to  learn  more  about  the  process  behind  the  \nselection of these domains and the co-design phase, please see the Methodology appendix of this report.   \n4.1 Exploring a Data Trust for Cycling in London \n \nSummary \n• Context: Meeting emissions reduction targets requires a significant move away from motorised \ntransport to more active forms of travel. In London, a quarter of carbon emissions come from the \ntransport of people and goods, but cycling is on the rise. \n• Key actors: The ecosystem consists of cyclists, Transport for London, the 33 London Boroughs, \nmapping and navigation services, micro mobility providers, and academic institutions. \n• Opportunity: There is demand for more precise data in this domain, as well as desire for \nimproved cycling infrastructure among the cycling community and existing models of bottom-up \ncivic participation to provide inspiration. \n• Potential data trust: A London Cycle Data Trust could provide London's cycling community  \nwith a platform to contribute data to affect positive changes to the design of cycling infrastructure \nin their city. \n• Legal form: Under UK GDPR, subjects of personal data are granted eight extended rights, \nwhich could be delegated to a ‘true’ legal trust or a company limited by guarantee. \n• Governance: Trustees could include experts on city sustainability, digital economy, law, and \ntechnology, taking on responsibility for granular decisions about who can access the data \nbrought together as well as advocating for broader improvements to cycling infrastructure. \n• Technology: A mobile app - Positive Cycle -   could collect GPS data and motion data about  \nthe cyclists’ movements; given the sensitive nature of the data, a ‘privacy by design’ approach \nshould be adopted. \n• Sustainability: Setting up a London Cycle Data Trust could be supported by philanthropic \nfunders, with various potential revenue models for self-sustainability. \n \n  \n\nEnabling Data Sharing for Social Benefit Through Data Trusts: Data Trusts in Climate \n15 \n \n4.1.1. Introduction to the domain \nCities are major contributors to climate change - despite accounting for less than 2% of the Earth’s surface, \ncities  consume  78%  of  the  world’s  energy  and  produce  more  than  60%  of  greenhouse  gas  emissions.\n52\n \nAccording  to  a  UN  report,  another  2.5  billion  people  will  reside  in  urban  areas  by  2050.\n53\n  Taken  from  a  \nhistorical  perspective,  cities  in  the  global  north  have  contributed  significantly  more  to  climate  change  than  \nthose in the global south – according to one study, the global north has contributed around 92% of excess \nglobal carbon emissions.\n54\n \nThere are a number of areas where cities can mitigate their impact on climate change – from reducing the \namount of energy and water that is used, to tackling the level of air pollution around the city, to improving the \nways that its citizens move around the city in a more sustainable way.\n55\n Meeting greenhouse gas emissions \nreduction targets requires a significant move away from motorised transport – shifting to active transport could \nsave as much as a quarter of personal carbon dioxide emissions from transport.\n56\n This makes shifting away \nfrom  car  usage  in  cities  a  high  impact  opportunity.  In  order  to  encourage  more  people  to  cycle,  there  is  a  \ngeneral consensus that if good cycling infrastructure is built, then people will use it. In Spain, Seville’s decision \nto build 80km of cycle lanes in just a few years led to significant behaviour change, and an 11-fold increase \nin rider numbers.\n57\n \nA quarter of London’s carbon emissions come from the transport of people and goods, with three quarters of \nthese  from  road  transport\n58\n.  While  some  action  has  been  taken  (such  as  the  expansion  of  the  Ultra  Low  \nEmissions Zone), there remains more to be done to reduce the number of cars on its roads. As part of this, \nmore than 260km of new cycling infrastructure has been built since 2016, increasing the cycle network by a \nfactor  of  five.\n59\n  Combined  with  the  increase  in  physical  exercise  due  to  the  Covid-19  Pandemic,\n60\n  it  has  \ncontributed to a huge boost in cycling, with more than 200% increase in cycle flows in the last two weekends \nof February 2021 compared to 2020.\n61\n  \n  \n \n52 \nUnited Nations, ‘Cities and Pollution’, https://www.un.org/en/climatechange/climate-solutions/cities-pollution  \n53\n Ibid. \n54 \nHickel, J.

The cycling ecosystem in London \nCycling is growing in popularity in London and its number of cyclists have more than doubled since 2000.\n62\n \nAccording to a recent report, 27% of Londoners already cycle and another 16% are actively considering taking \nup cycling.\n63\n During the Covid-19 pandemic, many cities experienced a boom in cycling, as people spent more \ntime outside exercising. London was no different, with a 7% increase in cycling in inner London and a 22% \nincrease in outer London in 2020 compared to 2019.\n64\n  \n50% of Londoners own or have access to their own bikes,\n65\n and this ecosystem is supported by a growing \nnetwork of micro-mobility providers, including Santander Cycles, HumanForest and Lime. \nThere is a strong desire from the London Mayor's Office to improve the cycling experience in London. Its \ntransport  strategy  states  that  by  2041,  80%  of  journeys  are  to  be  made  by  walking,  cycling  and  public  \ntransport.\n66\n Decisions about the development of cycling infrastructure in London are made by two key groups: \nTransport for London and the 33 London Boroughs. These groups employ an evidence-based approach \nto  planning  and  evaluating  new  cycling  infrastructure,  utilising  an  increasingly  wide  range  of  information  to  \ninform their decisions.\n67\n \nCyclists use a number of services to get around, including mobile apps such as Google Maps, Komoot and \nCityMapper. On these apps cycling is one of the standard mobility options to choose from, while other services \n– such as Strava – are more directly focused on meeting cyclists' needs.  \nAdvocacy  groups,  such  as  the  London  Cycling  Campaign,  advocate  on  the  behalf  of  London cyclists  to  \nimprove  the  safety  of  London's  cycling  ecosystem,\n68\n  and  have  created  products  like  the  Healthy  Streets  \nScorecard\n69\n and the Climate Safe Streets report.\n70\n  \n  \n \n62 \nMayor of London and Transport for London (2018), ‘Cycling action plan’, https://content.tfl.gov.uk/cycling-action-plan.pdf  \n63\n 2CV (2021), ‘Cycling potential in London’s diverse communities’, https://content.tfl.gov.uk/cycling-potential-in-londons-\ndiverse-communities-2021.pdf  \n64 \nTfL (2021). ‘Outer London sees 22 per cent rise in cycling as new data shows vital role in active travel’,  https://tfl.gov.uk/info-\nfor/media/press-releases/2021/january/outer-london-sees-22-per-cent-rise-in-cycling-as-new-data-further-highlights-vital-role-\nof-active-travel  \n65 \n2CV (2021), ‘Cycling potential in London’s diverse communities’, https://content.tfl.gov.uk/cycling-potential-in-londons-\ndiverse-communities-2021.pdf  \n66 \nMayor of London (2021), ‘The Mayor's Transport Strategy’, https://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/mayors-transport-\nstrategy-2018.pdf  \n67 \nMayor of London (2018), ‘Cycling action plan’, https://content.tfl.gov.uk/cycling-action-plan.pdf  \n68 \nLondon Cycling Campaign, ‘Campaigns’, https://lcc.org.uk/campaigns/  \n69 \nLondon Boroughs Healthy Streets Scorecard, https://www.healthystreetsscorecard.london/  \n70 \nGraham, F.

The opportunity to improve how data is stewarded \nUnderstanding the different ways that people move around the city is important for making decisions about \ninfrastructure improvement. TfL utilises data modelling to understand where the best value cycle routes could \nbe built, and provide the local boroughs with the funding to build these routes. They take an evidence based \napproach to evaluating the impacts of new infrastructure, utilising survey data, traffic counts and more. TfL’s \nmodels attempt to predict traffic flows around the city, and to understand the impacts that new infrastructure \nmay have on the flow of the city. \nThrough the co-design phase, we also learnt that other actors were interested in accessing and using data \nabout  cycling  patterns  in  London.  Transport  providers  and  micro  mobility  companies are  seeking  to  \nunderstand  how  people  move  around  the  city  to  best  meet  the  needs  of  their  customers.  Companies  like  \nVivacity Labs are working with the local boroughs to improve transport services by reducing congestion and \nimproving  air  quality  using  data  from  cameras  and  sensors,  and  academic  institutions  such  as  the  AI  for  \nPeople and Planet department at UCL are attempting to use data and AI to improve passenger forecasting \nand personalised travel recommendations. \nCycling data tends to originate from manual processes like bike counts, origin-destination polls and surveys \nor directly from service users who have consented to data collection through Google, Strava and telecoms \nproviders.  For  example,  Strava’s  Metro  tool  ‘aggregates,  de-identifies  and  contextualises  this  [Strava’s] \ndataset to help make cities better for anyone on foot or on a bike’.\n71\n Strava Metro claims to be the largest \naggregated and de-identified active transportation dataset in the world\n72\n and has worked with cities such as \nOslo and Sydney to better understand mobility flows and to improve their infrastructure.\n73\n  \nHowever,  multiple  participants  in  the  design  phase  for  this  domain  suggested  that  this  data  is  often  too  \nexpensive  to  access,  not  granular  enough  or  lacking  representation.\n7475\n    On  the  latter  point,  they  argued   \nthat  the  common  user  of  the  Strava  and  similar  ‘niche’  apps  does  not  represent  the  majority  of  London’s  \ncycling community, missing everyday Londoners who utilise their bikes for trips to the shops or to drop their \nkids at school. \nAccording to several of our participants, there is precedent for cyclists coalescing around efforts to improve \ncycling infrastructure. For example, in their use of platforms such as FixMyStreet to report, view, or discuss \nproblems  with  local  roads,\n76\n  and  in  Galway,  Ireland,  using  a  collective  intelligence  tool  to  generate  ideas   \nfor  improving  the  city’s  mobility  planning\n77\n.   Despite  this,  and  increases  to  people’s  awareness  of  data  \ncollection  and  use  that  underpins  technologies  like  these  route  planning  services,\n78\n  cyclists  currently  have  \nlimited control over how data about them is collected, used or shared, and opportunities to direct it towards \ncauses they support. \n \n71 \nStrava Metro, https://metro.strava.com/  \n72 \nStrava (2019),. ‘Strava Releases 2019 Year In Sport Data Report’, https://blog.strava.com/press/strava-releases-2019-year-\nin-sport-data-report/  \n73 \nSaberi, M.

The potential of a data trust in this domain \nA London Cycle Data Trust could bring together London's cycling community, and provide them with a platform \nto contribute data to affect positive changes to the design of cycling infrastructure in their city. \nIn aggregate and under specified terms, the data brought together by London Cycle Data Trust could be used \nby Transport for London and the 33 London Boroughs to feed into their decision making and the design of \nnew  cycling  infrastructure.  Further  context  about  how  different  people  move  around  the  city,  and  for  what  \nreasons,  would  feed  directly  into  the  modelling  and  evaluation  models.  Other  organisations  like  London  \nCycling  Campaign  could  use  the  data  to  drive  their  evidence-based  advocacy  work,  and  micro  mobility  \ncompanies could use the data to better position their fleets to support the public. Importantly, some uses would \nbe blocked – for example, access may not be granted to companies seeking to target cyclists with advertising \nbased on their movements. \n \nFigure 1: a potential London Cycling Data Trust \n  \n\nEnabling Data Sharing for Social Benefit Through Data Trusts: Data Trusts in Climate \n19 \n \nSome bottom-up data stewardship initiatives are enabled by groups of individuals being willing to donate data \ntowards a good cause.\n79\n OpenHumans, for example, enables people to make data about their health available \nfor citizen science projects and new medical research. In this context, participants felt that cyclists would need \nto engage in some form of mutual value exchange, beyond the knowledge of putting data to use for a cause \nthey believe in. So what could this value exchange look like?  \nOur participants described that a data trust in this context would need to ‘meet Londoner cyclists where they \nare’,  using  technologies  they  are  already  familiar  with.  Given  71%  of  people  in  the  UK  use  a  smart  phone  \nevery day\n80\n and the popularity of mobile apps like Google Maps, CityMapper and Strava, we developed a set \nof wireframes to show what a smartphone app for the London Cycle Data Trust could look like, called Positive \nCycle. The app would be the interface through which individuals interact with the data trust. \nFigure 2: Positive Cycle’s introduction, home, route planning and saved route screens \n \n \n  \n \n79 \nTophof, N. & Tischer, M. (2020), ‘Data donation: better health and quality of life for all’, \nhttps://www.data4life.care/en/library/journal/data-donation-in-medicine/  \n80 \nOfcom (2020), ‘Online Nation: 2020 Report’, https://www.ofcom.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0027/196407/online-nation-\n2020-report.pdf  \n\nEnabling Data Sharing for Social Benefit Through Data Trusts: Data Trusts in Climate \n20 \n \nThe Positive Cycle app could provide a cycling route planning tool. Our participants felt that a well-designed \ntool, with options based on faster routes, slower routes, and routes taken by other similar cyclists, could attract \na  significant  body  of  users,  including  those  who  may  not  normally  be  comfortable  with  cycling  in  London.  \nPositive Cycle could also provide access to ride statistics and information about previous trips around the city, \nand enable users to rate routes or report poor quality or issues with cycle infrastructure. \nOne of the main challenges to attracting users to the London Cycle Data Trust would be in ensuring the users \nof  the  trust  are  representative  of  the  wider  cycling  community.  Levels  of  cycling  will  vary  across  London  \nboroughs as a result of a number of factors, including the quality of cycle infrastructure, the demography of its \nresidents and levels of digital access and literacy. \n4.1.5. Legal underpinnings of the data trust \nThe London Cycle Data Trust, via the Positive Cycle app, would collect and hold at least two types of data, \nboth of which would be sensitive. The first is demographic and contextual data, such as gender and ethnicity, \nas well as important locations to the user such as their home, school, and place of work. The second would \nbe location and motion data generated through use of the app. \nUnder  UK  GDPR,  subjects  of  personal  data\n81\n  are  granted  eight  extended  rights,  including  the  right  to  \nportability,  and  the  London  Cycle  Data  Trust  would  need  to  gain  the  consent  of  the  user  to  process  this  \npersonal data. Given the well documented limitations of informed consent,\n82\n and indeed the spirit of bottom-\nup  data  stewardship,  one  participant  suggested  that  the  London  Cycle  Data  Trust  would  need  to  ‘be  \nexceedingly  transparent  with  information  about  what  data  is  collected,  how  it  is  used,  and  who  it  is   \nshared with’.  \nFigure 3: Positive Cycle’s information screens \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n81 \nThe Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations defines location data as ‘information collected by an app or service \nprovider about where the user’s phone was located at a certain time’. \n82 \nHayden, E. (2012), ‘Informed consent: A broken contract’, https://doi.org/10.1038/486312a  \n\nEnabling Data Sharing for Social Benefit Through Data Trusts: Data Trusts in Climate \n21 \n \nWe arrived at two potential legal forms to incorporate the London Cycling Data Trust and bind trustees to clear \nfiduciary duties to the cyclists. \nFirst, it could be possible to structure it using a ‘true’ legal trust. Research has shown that trusts' origins in \nEngland and Wales make it a suitable jurisdiction for instantiating data trusts through trust law.\n83\n There are \nthree certainties required for the creation of an express trust under English law: certainty of intention; certainty \nof subject matter; and certainty of beneficiaries (objects).\n84\n \nIn the case of the London Cycle Data Trust, there would be clarity in the intention of the trust – for cyclists in \nLondon  to  come  together  to  improve  cycling  infrastructure.  In  this  structure,  the  cyclists  would  be  both  the  \nsettlers, those who come together to create the trust, and the beneficiaries of the trust, those who receive the \nbenefits of the trust, while the ‘trustees’ would have fiduciary duties towards the trust. \nWith regards to the certainty of subject matter, trusts have proven to be flexible in adapting to different types \nof assets across centuries, and have already been established for rights relating to intellectual property.\n85\n The \nlegal literature relating to data trusts suggests that almost any right can be held in trust and that data rights \ncould in principle be held in trust.\n8687\n   However, as yet no examples of trusts holding data rights have been \nestablished.  This  has  been  recognised  in  literature  around  data  trusts.  Questions  also  remain  around  the  \nability of individuals to delegate rights under GDPR according to Paragraph 24 of the draft Data Governance \nAct.\n88\n Participants in our co-design phase indicated that structuring the London Cycle Data Trust as a legal \ntrust could be possible, but that ‘we would not know until a data trust was established and implemented in the \nUK’ in this way.  \nIt  could  also  be  possible  to  create  the  London  Cycle  Data  Trust  using  alternate  legal  form,\n89\n  such  as  \nincorporating it as a company limited by guarantee. Limited by guarantee companies are most often formed \nby non-profit organisations – such as sports clubs, workers' co-operatives and membership organisations – \nwhose owners wish to have the benefit of limited financial liability. For this legal structure to be a ‘data trust’, \nit must meet the essential characteristics of a data trust.

Directors would have fiduciary duties towards the company\n95\n and are regarded as the \ntrustees of their office as well as the subject matter or proceeds of the company\n96\n. They would have separate \nduties to shareholders/members of a fiduciary character.\n97\n  \nBoth of these options could prove feasible vehicles for the creation of the London Cycling Data Trust and data \ntrusts generally; here more than anywhere there is a need for real-world data trusts to prove what is possible. \nSetting up new organisations is difficult.\n98\n A number of participants suggested another option would be for a \nsimilar, active initiative such as Posmo.Coop or the Bike Data Project\n99\n to take on the intended functionality \nof the London Cycle Data Trust. This was on the basis that the main difference between this hypothetical data \ntrust and the other initiatives was their lack of independent trustees and fiduciary obligations (two of GPAI’s \nfive  functional  elements).  Provided  there  was  demand,  attempting  to  layer  on  these functions  could  be  a  \npractical route to instantiating a real-world data trust, rather than starting from scratch in parallel.  \n4.1.6. Potential trustees and decision making within the data trust \nAs data trusts have yet to become operational, the role of trustee of a data trust has not yet existed. While  \nit has been theorised,\n100\n and there may be learnings from trustees in other trusts, from the operationalisation \nof fiduciary duties in other domains, and from the charity sector, this is a novel role which would come with \nnew challenges.  \nThe  role  of  trustee  requires  independence  and  ‘undivided  loyalty  and  dedication  to  the  interests  and  \naspirations of the beneficiaries’.\n101\n Therefore, the London Cycling Data Trust would need to be made up of a \n \n90 \nThe GPAI Data Working Group (2021), ‘Understanding Data Trusts’, https://ceimia.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/2021-07-\n09-GPAI-summary-understanding-data-trusts-updated.docx.pdf  \n91 \nDelacroix, S. & Lawrence, N.

The trustees could include experts on \ndata stewardship, city sustainability, and climate change, as well as the digital economy, law, and technology.  \nIt’s worth noting that the role of a trustee may not be suitable for the settlers of the trust, in this case London \ncyclists, given the legal implications and skills required for the role. A question therefore remains around how \nindividuals can meaningfully  participate in decision making about how data is accessed, used and shared \nwithin a data trust without taking on the role of a trustee. \nThe role of trustee would involve acting on behalf of and furthering the interests of the cyclists. It could include \nmaking granular decisions about who can and cannot access the data brought together and for what purpose, \nand  defining  the  terms  of  data  sharing  agreements  with  third  parties  and  ensuring  they  are  upheld.  The  \ntrustees  could  also  seek  to  leverage  the  negotiating  power  of  the  pooled  rights  to  secure  more  favourable  \nbroader outcomes for the beneficiaries. In this case, this could take the form of advocating for specific changes \nto cycling infrastructure, informed by uses of the data, or for changes to data portability legislation to enable \ncyclists to more easily transfer data from other sources to the London Cycling Data Trust.\n102\n The role of trustee \nof a data trust, including this one, would be specialised and likely more hands-on than that of a trustee of a \n‘regular’  charity.  Ultimately,  data  trusteeship  could  require  professionalisation,  such  as  in  the  form  of  \nqualification, remuneration and defined liability. \n4.1.7. Digital infrastructure and technology \nThere are many mobile apps that collect mobility data, such as Strava, Nike Running and Komoot. It’s even \nrelatively common among existing bottom-up data stewardship initiatives – for example, Posmo.Coop\n103\n is a \nmobility data cooperative that enables people to collect and donate mobility to improve transport planning and \ninvestment, and Tripshift\n104\n helps individuals and businesses to understand their carbon footprint by collecting \ndata about the ways they move around. The digital infrastructure of the London Cycle Data Trust is inspired \nby these services, as well the Bike Data Project and Smart Green Journeys. \nUtilising  services  embedded  in  the  iOS  and  Android  operating  systems,  the  London  Cycle  Data  Trust  app  \nwould  collect  GPS  data  to  capture  how  the  user  is  moving  around\n105\n,  and  motion  data,\n106\n  which helps  to  \ndecipher the form of mobility each journey takes, such as walking, running, cycling and driving. This could be \ncombined with data that the user could manually enter, such as demographic information, route preferences \nor even trip ratings. Another option speculated by design phase participants would be to ingest data originally \ncollected and held by other, similar services. This could be possible through real time connection via an API \n(such as Strava’s) to enable users to ‘port’ data directly, or allowing bulk uploads for data that the user has \nalready downloaded from other services.  \n \n \n \n102 \nStrava (2018), ‘Strava API Agreement’, https://www.strava.com/legal/api  \n103 \nPosmo.Coop, https://posmo.coop/  \n104 \nTripshift, https://tripshift.eco/  \n105 \nApple, ‘CLLocation Manager’, https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corelocation/cllocationmanager  \n106 \nIbid. \n\nEnabling Data Sharing for Social Benefit Through Data Trusts: Data Trusts in Climate \n24 \n \nLocation data is particularly sensitive, as would be the contextual data collected about users by the app. A \nnumber of participants in the design phase argued strongly that the London Cycle Data Trust would need to \ntake a ‘privacy by design’ approach. This could manifest in data collection, whereby for each trip the start and \nend points could be blurred within a 1km radius. Another option would be to limit the granularity of the data \nthat organisations can access, such as allowing for a time lag before sharing. A number of participants argued \nfor the usage of Privacy Enhancing Technologies (PETs), which could help maintain the utility of the dataset \nfor the purposes of AI. When allowing users to access data, techniques like differential privacy, which allows \nthe  generation  of  aggregate  statistics  about  a  dataset  but  obfuscates  individual  records\n107\n,  could  be  used.  \nOne participant described how developing a synthetic dataset (data that is artificially created rather than being \ngenerated by actual events)\n108\n would allow organisations to develop models to apply to the London Cycling \nData Trust data while reducing the risks to privacy of the data subjects; these models could be audited by the \ntrustees of the London Cycling Data Trust to ensure they are within the bounds of the cyclists’ preferences \nbefore being applied to the real dataset. Alternatively, Trusted Research Environments – a secure computing \nenvironment to help keep data secure, whilst making it accessible for researchers to conduct research in a \nsafe way\n109\n– were also posited as an option that would safely allow the data trust to engage with data users.  \n  \n \n107 \nThe Open Data Institute (2019), ‘Anonymisation and Open Data: An Introduction to managing the risk of re-identification’, \nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1CoXniaTnQL_4ZyQuji9_MA_YCEElQjx4z1SEdB08c2M/edit#  \n108 \nDilmengani, C.

(2021), ‘The what & why of trusted research environments’, https://understandingpatientdata.org.uk/news/what-\nwhy-trusted-research-environments  \n\nEnabling Data Sharing for Social Benefit Through Data Trusts: Data Trusts in Climate \n25 \n \n4.1.8. Financial sustainability and scale \nAccess to initial funding, plus the development of a sustainable revenue model, is one of the main challenges \nfaced by bottom-up data stewardship initiatives.\n110\n Given the lack of precedent for data trusts, the amount of \nfunding to establish the London Cycle Data Trust is difficult to estimate. \nRegarding  sources  of  funding,  Transport  for  London  and  the  Greater  London  Authority  have  a  history  of  \nsupporting data initiatives. Other options include philanthropic funders based in the UK – for example, The \nNational   Lottery,   which   supports   a   number   of   community-based   initiatives.   Similarly,   philanthropic   \norganisations with an interest in data stewardship may take an interest in a practical application of a data trust. \nOne participant suggested that bike companies and other mobility providers could be motivated to provide \nsupport, on the basis that the London Cycling Data Trust would improve the cycling experience, and in the \nlong run, possibly even boost cyclist numbers. \nThe  London  Cycle  Data Trust  would  need  to  attract  a  critical  mass  of  users.  It  would  need  to  accumulate  \n(control of) a dataset of a certain size, breadth and/or depth so as to offer something useful to other actors in \nthe ecosystem. One expert articulated that “it’s difficult to put a number on a critical mass of users, because \nit depends not only on how many journeys, but also on the contextual data that explains those journeys”. In \nother words, a dataset of 100 journeys with context (age, ethnicity, gender of the rider, and data about the \nstart and end locations) may be more useful than a dataset of 10,000 journeys which detail a route taken from \nthe same A to B. \nOnce it has such a critical mass of data, the London Cycle Data Trust could attempt to adopt a sustainable \nbusiness model. Revenue could be generated by charging for licences to access the data to organisations \n(which the trustees deem to align with the preferences of the cyclists)\n111\n. Alongside, for public sector access, \nthe approach taken by the High Street Data Project, which aims ‘to provide organisations ongoing access to \nthe best local high streets and town centre data at low cost’\n112\n, could be used. For this, the Greater London \nAuthority purchased access to large datasets from Mastercard and O2 on behalf of the 33 boroughs and then \nused in-house capabilities to analyse the data streams and provide insights back to them. Such a model would \nsuit the London Cycle Data Trust as it takes into account the relative digital skills and capacity of each borough \nto analyse data, and it mimics the current decision-making flow for the development of cycling infrastructure. \nWith  this  differential  approach,  the  London  Cycle  Data  Trust  should  be  able  to  enable  access  to  data  for  \nreduced  fees  (or  even  free)  to  certain  types  of  organisations,  like  academic  institutions  or  civil  society  \norganisations. Further down the line, the London Cycle Data Trust could offer consultancy, insights and other \nservices ‘on-top-of the data’. \n  \n \n110 \nDodds, L. et. al.

Introduction to the domain \nClimate change has had a tremendous impact on agriculture. Higher temperatures lead to a decrease in yield \n(crop production), while encouraging the proliferation of pests and diseases.\n113\n Changes in the frequency and \nseverity of droughts and floods pose challenges for farmers and threaten food safety.\n114\n Through a combined \neffect of increased temperatures and shifts in precipitation cycles, farmers the world over are also now unable \nto harvest crops traditionally grown on their lands, and the nutritional value of many crops is reducing.\n115\n \nAgriculture,  in  turn,  contributes  to  climate  change.  Agriculture  is  one  of  the  greatest  contributors  to  global  \nwarming,  through  greenhouse  gas  emissions.\n116\n  In  2010,  agriculture,  forestry  and  land-use  change  were  \nestimated  to  contribute  20–25%  of  global  annual  emissions.\n117\n  In  2020,  the  European  Union's  Scientific   \nAdvice Mechanism estimated\n118\n that the food system as a whole contributed 37% of total greenhouse gas \nemissions, and that this figure was on course to increase by 30–40% by 2050 due to population growth and \ndietary change. \nWhile populations living in developing countries are already vulnerable and food insecure, they are also likely \nto be the most affected by the impacts of climate change on agriculture, owing to their greater dependence \non agriculture.\n119\n The Asia-Pacific region may also experience the worst effect on wheat and rice (the two \nmain staples in India) worldwide, with crop models indicating average yield levels for wheat and rice in 2050 \nto decrease from 2000 yield levels by 50% and 17% respectively.\n120\n \nSmall and marginal shareholder farmers account for 86% of the total number of farmers in India.\n121\n They are \nhampered by low productivity, due to a combination of being unable to afford advanced machinery and an \ninability  to  implement  modern  farming  practices.  Despite  this,  they  contribute  to  51%  of  India’s  agricultural  \noutput, and 70% of all high-value crops,\n122\n highlighting their importance in the food supply chain. \n  \n \n113 \nNelson, G.C. et. al.

The small shareholder farming ecosystem in India \nSmall  shareholder  farmers  comprise  an  overwhelming  majority  of  the  farmers  in  India,  but  despite  this  \ncontribute to less than 50% of the total cropping area.\n123\n Such farmers tend to hold very small pieces of land \n– around 37% of farm households owned land parcels smaller than 0.4 hectares and 30% had holdings which \nfell between 0.41 and 1.0 hectares.\n124\n Small shareholder farmers in India are typically from rural areas and \nhave low incomes.\n125\n \nIntermediaries, who are referred to in various terms across different regions in India, play a critical role in the \nsmall  shareholder  farming  ecosystem.  These  intermediaries  provide  a  variety  of  services  including  credit  \nlending, transportation, aggregation of produce as well as advisory roles.\n126\n Given the importance of these \nintermediaries  in  obtaining  essential  services,  farmers  tend  to  put  a  lot  of  faith  in  them  and  they  hold   \nsignificant power. \nGiven their small margins, and inability to store and transport crops, small shareholder farmers rely on local \nprivate  traders.\n127\n  These  traders  typically  buy  crops  from  a  number  of  small  shareholder  farmers  to  then  \nstore and sell it further. These traders exist as an option to farmers alongside the APMC ‘mandis’, government \nregulated primary markets which guarantee farmers a minimum sale price.\n128\n \nGovernance of agriculture in India is divided between the central and state governments, set out by Article \n246 of the constitution.\n129\n The central and state governments provide a number of welfare schemes to farmers, \nhowever there is a deficit of trust in many areas of India between farmers and the central government, which \nhas been exacerbated\n130\n by the recently repealed farm laws and protests.\n131\n \nThe Indian Council for Agricultural Research (ICAR)\n132\n and state agricultural research institutions issue \nregular advisories to farmers, including weather-based crop advice\n133\n and manuals that provide guidance on \nwater management,\n134\n land preparation,\n135\n and cultivation of specific varieties of crops.\n136\n \n \n123 \nSubanandhini, D.

In  \naddition to providing the necessary farming materials and equipment, certain private companies also provide \nfarmers with income security. For example, by providing seeds to farmers at a discounted rate, along with \nguidance on how to grow the crop, provided they can buy the harvest directly from the farmers. \nThere are also now a number of agtech companies that are looking to deploy new technologies to improve \nfarming practices in the sector. Climate-smart agriculture,\n137\n for example, is an initiative that looks to adopt an \nintegrative approach to increase productivity (crop yield), enhance crop resilience, and reduce emissions.   \n4.2.3. The opportunity to improve how data is stewarded \nVia  our  co-design  participants,  we  learned  that  current  efforts  to  collect,  use  and  share  data  about  small  \nshareholder farming in India are driven by two main forces. \nThe first is to increase the transparency of supply chains, which is essential for the certification of ‘organic’ or \n‘pesticide free’ produce. In this case, companies selling to end consumers collect information regarding the \ntypes of fertiliser, and insect prevention used by farmers. However, this information is not collected directly \nfrom farmers, but from the local traders from whom the produce is bought by the companies. There is no direct \nbenefit from such data collection being borne to the farmers.  \nThe second is undertaken by the government for multiple purposes such as designing welfare programmes \nand  informing  the  state  of  agricultural  output.  This  data  collection  is  usually  carried  out  through  procured  \npartners and  is  often  paper-based.  Similar  types  of  information  are  collected  by  different  departments  and  \nstored in different formats, fuelled by the lack of prescribed standards within this domain. Over the last few \nyears, the Indian government has shown an increasing interest in digitising the agriculture sector via initiatives \nlike AgriStack\n138\n, which aims ‘to build a National Digital Agriculture Ecosystem, to elevate Indian Agriculture \nSector to higher levels of efficiency and productivity, and to improve the welfare and income of farmers.’\n139\n \nHowever, it is unclear what access farmers will have to the data collected by these initiatives, as well as how \nthey will derive benefits from the activities. Additionally, it is unclear whom their data will be shared with and \nwhat uses it will be put to. \nIn  practice,  these  collection  efforts  do  not  foreground  the  needs  and  concerns  of  the  farmers,  rather  they  \ntypically approach data collection through a lens of either broader public good or private gains. As a result, \nthere is very little-to no benefits accruing to farmers from data collection initiatives. \nThe  participants  of  the  co-design  phase  for  this  domain  showed  interest  in  the  idea  of  bottom-up  data  \nstewardship, as they felt it could help to reverse current data practices, where farmers could take the initiative, \nexert  more  control  over  the  data  about  their  farming  and  benefit  from  its  use.  We  learned  of  bottom-up \ninitiatives in other parts of the word like the Birchip Cropping Group,\n140\n which is a farmer-led organisation in \n \n137 \nWorld Bank (2021), ‘Climate-Smart Agriculture’, https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/climate-smart-agriculture  \n138 \nMinistry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare (2021), ‘Government is in the process of finalising 'India Digital Ecosystem of \nAgriculture (IDEA)' which will lay down a framework for Agristack’,  \nhttps://pib.gov.in/PressReleaseIframePage.aspx?PRID=1741995 \n139 \nIbid. \n140 \nBirchip Cropping Group, https://www.bcg.org.au/  \n\nEnabling Data Sharing for Social Benefit Through Data Trusts: Data Trusts in Climate \n30 \n \nVictoria,  Australia  aiming  to  improve  the  prosperity  of  farmers  and  agricultural  communities  by  providing  \nevidence, support and tools for improving farm management practices and profitability. \nThe  diversity  in  India’s  geology  and  weather  patterns  represent  another  opportunity  to  improve  data  use  \naround  small  shareholder  farming.  One  of  our  participants  described  how  the  highly  varying  nature  of  \nenvironmental conditions across the country renders pan-India standardisation of farming guidance futile. This \nsuggests that local groups of farmers could coalesce to generate hyperlocal datasets, which could be shared \nwith the government, research institutions and agtech firms, in return for services and advice better suited to \ntheir  environmental  circumstances  and  needs  (for  example,  related  to  appropriate  seeds,  efficient  water  \nconsumption, and sustainable land and soil usage). \n4.2.4. The potential of a data trust in this domain \nSmall shareholder farmers could come together to set up a data trust. The data trust could collect data from \nthe farmers, such as farm size, soil type and quality, water usage, types of seeds used, types and quantities \nof fertilisers, insecticides and pesticides used and crop yield.  \nThe data collected could then be aggregated and shared by the trust on privacy respecting terms with relevant \nstakeholders. Privacy is crucial in this context, as a lot of this data could be used to aid private firms’ land \ngrabbing,\n141\n or to introduce farmers into new systems of credit rating that could be potentially exploitative and \nbiased.\n142\n These stakeholders could include the government, research institutions and private sector firms. \nThis  data  could  be  used  by  the  government  and  public  research  institutions  to  gain  a  more  accurate  and  \nhyperlocal  understanding  of  the  agriculture  practices  adopted  by  farmers.  The  sharing  of  data  with  these  \nstakeholders would take place under terms that are in line with the farmers’ preferences as indicated to the \ntrustees.  The  data  could  also  be  used  by  private  sector  firms  to  train  and  fine  tune  smart  agriculture  \ntechnologies, again if permissible under those preferences. \nImportantly, in return, the farmers could access more tailored advice and information on sustainable farming \npractices, which could also help them increase their yield.  \n \n \n141 \nShiva, V. (2011), ‘The great land grab: India’s war on farmers’, https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2011/6/7/the-great-land-\ngrab-indias-war-on-farmers   \n142 \nDhara, T. (2016), ‘Marathwada's drought: Why debt-ridden farmers are deemed least creditworthy’, \nhttps://www.firstpost.com/india/marathwadas-drought-why-debt-ridden-farmers-are-deemed-the-least-creditworthy-\n2731158.html  \n\nEnabling Data Sharing for Social Benefit Through Data Trusts: Data Trusts in Climate \n31 \n \nFigure 4: a potential data trust for small shareholder farmers in India \n \nDuring  the  co-design  process,  we  spent  time  with  stakeholders  that  work  closely  with  small  shareholder  \nfarmers or have experience in establishing new data initiatives in agriculture. In general, these participants \nwere doubtful as to whether this constituted enough of an incentive for farmers to engage with a data trust. \nTo  begin  with,  participants  described  that  many  small  shareholders  farmers  in  India  have  rigid,  traditional \nattitudes towards farming practices and based on negative experiences in the past, would be sceptical of a \nnew data collection effort. \nMoreover, data is unlikely to be high up on small shareholder farmers’ agenda. One farmer we spoke to noted \nthat using data to understand the impact of climate on their farming or to increase the sustainability of their \npractices is not a priority concern. Rather, the main concerns for farmers lie in obtaining access to capital and \nfinding  new  markets  for  their  produce.  While  it  was  suggested  by  one  participant  that  the  data  trust  could  \ningest  financial  information  from  farmers  and  use  it  ‘to  create  creditworthiness  ratings  to  enable  access  to  \ncredit’, this did not feel like a suitable use case to us. This could introduce farmers to a new financial system, \nwhich could be opaque and discriminatory.\n143\n \n \n143 \nAhmed, S. (2020), ‘Alternative Credit Scoring – A Double Edged Sword’, https://vidhilegalpolicy.in/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/12/AlternativeCS_ShehnazA-1.pdf  \n\nEnabling Data Sharing for Social Benefit Through Data Trusts: Data Trusts in Climate \n32 \n \nAnother  issue  we  encountered  were  low  levels  of  digital  access  and  literacy  among  farmers  in  India,  with  \ndigital literacy levels of farmers in rural areas varying from 13% to 26%.\n144\n Taken in tandem with poor data \nconnectivity, this would make it incredibly difficult for farmers to engage with a data trust, even if there was \nsufficient incentive. \nParticipants  in  our  design  phase  suggested  that  an  external  organisation  would  be  needed  to  convey  to  \nfarmers the potential value of engaging and to help ‘onboard’ them. On this basis, we considered that a civil \nsociety organisation, with expertise in establishing new data initiatives, could partner with existing community-\nlevel  farmer  organisations  such  as  a  regional  farmer  producer  or  a  farmer  cooperative  to  drive  the  \ndevelopment of a data trust on behalf of the community. Participants posited the idea of engaging ‘field agents’ \nto help in conducting outreach, building capacity, and collecting data and directing it to the data trust. These \nfield agents could act as an intermediary between the farmers and the data trust, and even share and help \nfarmers interpret the advisories they receive in exchange.  \nFigure 5: Storyboard indicating how a potential data trust in this domain could function \n \n \n \n144 \nMothkoor, V., & Mumtaz, F. (2021), ‘The digital dream: Upskilling India for the future’, \nhttps://www.ideasforindia.in/topics/governance/the-digital-dream-upskilling-india-for-the-future.html  \n\nEnabling Data Sharing for Social Benefit Through Data Trusts: Data Trusts in Climate \n33 \n \n4.2.5. Legal underpinnings of the data trust \nMany of the types of data that could be collected by this data trust – details about framing practices, and soil \nquality, seeds used, water usage, etc – would likely constitute non-personal data under the proposed Data \nProtection  Bill.  The  report  by  the  Committee  of  Experts  on  Non-Personal  Data  Governance  Framework  \n(NPDR)\n145\n outlined certain key principles for governing non-personal data in India, including the recognition \nof community rights over data, and recommended the need for a separate law to govern it. However, this has \nnot yet been acted upon. \nThe data trust could of course also need to steward some personal data about the farmers themselves. India \ndoes  not  have  a  data  protection  legislation,  with  a  bill  to  regulate  data  governance  still  being  debated  in  \nParliament.\n146\n Data protection is therefore regulated in India by the Information Technology Act, 2000 (IT Act) \nand rules made under it.\n147\n The IT Act’s conception of data protection is limited to aspects of consent, access \nand correction rights.\n148\n In addition to this, the Supreme Court of India has recognised a constitutional right to \nprivacy for individuals.\n149\n  \nWithin the Indian agriculture sector, the AgriStack project seeks to digitise the agriculture sector in India and \ncreate an ecosystem for the sharing of agriculture data. However, the only guidance document on this project \ncurrently is a consultation paper, which does not go into specific details about the exact provisions that will \ngovern data sharing within this domain.\n150\n The report by Aapti Institute and the ODI on ‘Enabling data sharing \nfor social benefit through data trusts’ provides a detailed overview of other data sharing initiatives currently \nbeing explored by the Indian government.\n151\n  \nThere are therefore limited legal guard rails for developing this data trust. It could be argued that there is also \nno law that prevents the collection, use and sharing of these types of data in India. However, this could be a \nproblematic route to follow – it could allow for instances of misuse of data, either by trustees or third parties. \nWhile there are fiduciary obligations in the former case, the only recourse in the latter instance would be under \ncontract law, with the terms of the contract dictating the level of remedies available to farmers. \nIn terms of a legal structure for the data trust, it could not be incorporated as a true legal trust under the Indian \nTrusts Act, 1882. This is because Section 8 of the Indian Trusts Act, 1882 is very clear that the subject matter \nof the trust must be property that can be transferred to the beneficiary, and jurisprudence on trust law in India \nis clear that there needs to be property capable of being transferred as a subject matter of the trust, which is \nnot possible in the present case, as arguments for treating data as property are tenuous.\n152\n \n \n145 \nCommittee of Experts on Non-Personal Data Governance Framework (2020), ‘Revised Report of the Committee of Experts \non Non-Personal Data Governance Framework’, https://ourgovdotin.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/revised-report-kris-\ngopalakrishnan-committee-report-on-non-personal-data-governance-framework.pdf  \n146 \nJoint Committee of Parliament (2021), ‘Report of the Joint Committee on The Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019’,  \nhttps://prsindia.org/files/bills_acts/bills_parliament/2019/Joint_Committee_on_the_Personal_Data_Protection_Bill_2019.pdf  \n147 \nThe Information Technology Act 2000,  https://www.indiacode.nic.in/bitstream/123456789/13116/1/it_act_2000_updated.pdf  \n148 \nIbid. \n149 \nJustice K.S.

Directors of a company in India are recognised to have fiduciary duties towards the company (the \ndata  trust  in  this  case).\n155\n  It  could  be  beneficial  to  register  the  trust  as  a  Society,  with  the  fiduciary  \nresponsibilities of the trustees being codified in the memorandum of association of the trust. These are only \nmooted  legal  structures,  as  the  issue  regarding  lack  of  data  protection  in  India  serves  as  an  overarching  \nconcern in this domain, irrespective of the legal structure of the data trust. \n4.2.6. Potential trustees and decision making within the data trust \nIn this context, trustees would play a very critical role in stewarding data on behalf of the small shareholder \nfarmers, owing to the existing power imbalance between the farmers and the actors in the ecosystem, such \nas government and private firms. \nAs we’ve discussed, small shareholder farmers have low levels of digital literacy and are extremely reliant  \non local intermediaries to provide services such as access to credit, provision of machinery and transportation \nof crops to the market. Data held by the data trust would have the potential to provide insights that could be \nused by malicious actors for private gains at the detriment of farmers –for example, bottoming of prices for \ncrops, biased credit rating of farmers and possibly even acquisition of fertile farmland from individual farmers \nat low prices. \nIt would fall on the trustees to ensure they use the highest degree of care in deciding who may access the \ndata and enforce any data sharing arrangements. The data trust could be governed by a board of trustees \nmade  up  of  experts  with  diverse  expertise,  including  data  stewardship,  agriculture,  climate  change,  \ntechnology,  law  and  the  digital  economy.  The  board  could  also  have  a  respected  member  of  the  local  \ncommunity as a trustee.  \nHowever,  there  are  unanswered  questions  around  the  incentives  for  an  individual  to  take  on  the  role  of  a  \ntrustee  within  a  data  trust.  The  role  is  likely  to  be  under  high  pressure,  with  trustees  under  an  increased  \nfiduciary obligation to not only act in the best interests of the beneficiaries, but to also ensure that the data of \nthe  members  of  the  trust  is  not  misused.  There  would  also  likely  be  a  requirement  of  a  minimum  level  of  \nremuneration to the trustees. \n  \n \n153 \nThe Companies Act, 2013 (2013), https://www.indiacode.nic.in/bitstream/123456789/2114/1/A2013-18.pdf  \n154 \nThe Societies Registration Act, 1860, https://www.indiacode.nic.in/bitstream/123456789/2262/1/AAA1860____21.pdf  \n155 \nSingh, V.

Digital infrastructure and technology \nIn our co-design phase, a number of existing technologies that could be used by the data trust were highlighted \nto us. FarmOS, a web-based app for farm management, planning, and record keeping,\n156\n could be used by \nfarmers with access to digital technologies, as well as the trust itself to steward data on their behalf. \nWe had originally considered whether data could be collected by a mobile app, similar to the London Cycle \nData  Trust.  However,  given  the  low  levels  of  digital  literacy  and  digital  access  amongst  farmers,  and  as  \ndiscussed in previous sections, field agents from the local community could be trained to collect data from \nsmall shareholder farmers. Field agents could use tools such as SurveryCTO, Survey Stack or KoboCollect. \nThe advantage of tools such as SurveyCTO is that they enable offline collection of data, which is essential \ngiven the relatively low levels of internet connectivity in rural areas. \nData  collected  by  the  trust  could  be  aggregated  and  stored  on  a  cloud  server  –  for  which  there  are  many  \nproviders. As we discuss in previous sections, the data being collected from farmers would largely be non-\npersonal in nature. However, there may still be risks of harm, and it would be imperative that the data was \nstored securely. Given that the majority of small shareholder farmers are not digitally literate, there will be a \nmassive burden on the trustees to put in place technologies that share data with users securely and in ways \nthat could not be against their interests. \nOne of our participants noted that “this isn’t as much a technology problem as it is a data interoperability and \npolicy problem”. The lack of standards for the types of data considered in this domain means that the data \ntrust  would,  at  least,  have  a  role  to  play  in  cleaning  and  standardising  the  data  if  intending  to  aggregate  it  \nacross farms. In the longer run, it could convene different parties to develop those standards openly\n157\n, so \nthat they work for the different actors in the ecosystem. \nIn terms of disseminating the results of use of data accessed via the data trust, we learned of the need to \nconsider ‘informal’ outputs. The advisories on farming practices supplied to farmers, for example,  could be \nshared via Whatsapp or other popular messaging services. \n  \n \n156 \nfarmOS. https://farmos.org/  \n157 \nThe Open Data Institute (2018), ‘Open Standards for Data’, https://standards.theodi.org/  \n\nEnabling Data Sharing for Social Benefit Through Data Trusts: Data Trusts in Climate \n36 \n \n4.2.8. Financial sustainability \nParticipants highlighted that funding for data initiatives in agriculture in India is hard to come by, and successful \nexamples have largely been fundraised from farmers themselves and/or via online crowdfunding campaigns.  \nIt does not appear that the Indian government would look to fund the set up of a data trust in this context. One \nparticipant with experience of philanthropic funding noted that, historically, philanthropic funders have funded \ninitiatives that collect large amounts of data and unlock them for public value in a relatively short period of \ntime, whereas it may take considerable time for a data trust of this type to gather data at sufficient scale.  \nThe capability of farmers to engage in data collection practices, and the outcomes from data use, also has a \nbearing on the financial sustainability of the data trust. For a data trust to function successfully, a necessary \nprecondition would be to have farmers who are well-funded and motivated enough to be able to implement \nthe new sustainable practices recommended to them. As these would typically involve capital expenditures \non the part of farmers, the data trust would also need to find a way to provide monetary support to farmers – \nit couldn’t exist in a vacuum. Likewise, the use of field agents to accurately collect and upload data would \nrequire an investment in training and ongoing compensation, which would be a significant cost. \nIn order to sustain itself, the data trust could look to adopt a similar differentiated pricing model to the London \nCycle  Data  Trust,  whereby  it  charged  for  licences  to  access  the  data  to  organisations  (which  the  trustees  \ndeem  to  align  with  the  preferences  of  the  farmers),  while  allowing  for  subsidised  or  free  access  for  others  \n(such as the farmers themselves). In terms of a critical mass of farmers to take part in this type of data trust, \nparticipants suggested that it might not be very high, given the current dearth of timely, hyperlocal data in the \necosystem.  Adoption  by  even  100  farmers  from  one  particular  area  may  be  sufficient  for  the  data  to  be  \nmeaningful enough to create valuable tailored advisories.  \nAgain, given that data trusts currently do not exist,\n158\n it is difficult to estimate what financial resources would \nbe required to establish a data trust in this domain.\n159\n  \n  \n \n158 \nAapti Institute and Open Data Institute (2022), ‘Enabling data sharing for social benefit through data trusts’, \nhttps://gpai.ai/projects/data-governance/data-trusts/enabling-data-sharing-for-social-benefit-through-data-trusts.pdf   \n159 \nOne participant suggested that it might be possible to set up a data trust in this context for 100-200 farmers for US \n$1.2million, based on their understanding of the design and experience in setting up other data initiatives. This is only a \nmooted figure, and actual costs could vary dramatically. \n\nEnabling Data Sharing for Social Benefit Through Data Trusts: Data Trusts in Climate \n37 \n \n4.3 A Data Trust for Indigenous Climate Migration in Peru \n \nSummary \n• Context: In South America, Peru has been identified as one of the countries facing the high \nrates of future displacement due to climate change, with indigenous communities in Peru being \nsome of the most vulnerable to these impacts. \n• Key actors: The ecosystem consists of indigenous communities, 55 indingenous nations, \nseveral indigenous representative organisations, the Peruvian Government, small non-\ngovernmental actors, larger multinational organisations and academic institutions. \n• Opportunity: There is a need for data to better identify and understand climate-driven \ndisplacement, and indigenous communities in Peru have been active in establishing greater \ncontrol over their data. \n• Potential data trust: A data trust could act as steward of qualitative data sets related to \nindigenous climate displacement from across Peru, ensuring that the data is shared with \ntrustworthy organisations, and importantly, accessible to displaced communities themselves. \n• Legal form: Peru has some data rights afforded by data protection law and legal trusts,  \nalthough establishing a data trust would involve considerable challenges related to the  \nsensitivity of the data. \n• Governance: The most suitable candidates for trustees, or indeed hosts, of the data trust would \nbe indigenous representative organisations already in operation in the region, building on \ndevelopments in the broader field of indigenous data sovereignty and stewardship. \n• Technology: Qualitative data could be collected through a smartphone app or voice recording \nsoftware, and there may be opportunities to apply natural language processing to identify \npatterns in the data.  \n• Sustainability: Philanthropic funding could be the most realistic option to establish a data trust \nin  this domain, especially given the non-profit nature of the organisations involved.  \n \n \n  \n\nEnabling Data Sharing for Social Benefit Through Data Trusts: Data Trusts in Climate \n38 \n \n4.3.1. Introduction to the domain \nClimate change has a severe impact on human mobility, driving both national and international movement as \npeople flee rising sea levels, increasing temperatures, drought, floods and extreme weather events. In 2020, \nclose to seven million people in 104 countries were living in displacement as a result of disasters, with 98% \nof the new displacements occurring due to weather-related events.\n160\n \nAs climate change continues to worsen, these numbers are predicted to grow, with the World Bank predicting \nthat more than 143 million people could be displaced within their own country by 2050.\n161\n \nIn  South  America,  the  International  Organisation  for  Migration  has  identified  Peru  as  one  of  the  most  \nvulnerable to the impacts of climate change including a significant rise in climate migration, and specifically \ninternal displacement and migration\n162\n. Due to its geographical location, climate and environment, the country \nis at an increased risk of flooding, extreme weather events, food and water scarcity and increased disease \ntransmission. In 2021 alone, intense flooding led to 8,000 new internal displacements, more than doubling the \nnumbers from the previous year.\n163\n  \nThe  Peruvian  government  has  addressed  these  concerns  through  the  implementation  of  its  Framework   \nLaw  on  Climate  Change,  outlining  its  plan  for  tackling  the  adverse  impacts  of  climate  change,  including  \nincreased  climate  migration\n164\n.  Both  the  law  and  associated  report  identified  the  importance  of  indigenous  \nparticipation in the national discussion and set goals for implementing an action plan to address and reduce \nclimate migration.\n165\n  \nIndigenous leaders, advocates, front line defenders and communities have a long history of working to slow \nand  reverse  the  effects  of  climate  change  and  environmental  damage  in  Peru  and  beyond.\n166\n  They  have  \nsuccessfully fought for increased land rights, indigenous land stewardship and stronger legislation\n167\n, forging \ninternational alliances such as Coordinadora De Las Organizaciones Indígenas De La Cuenca Amazónica \nand the Ceibo Alliance.  \n  \n \n160 \nMigration Data Portal (2021), https://www.migrationdataportal.org/  \n161 \nBergmann, J. et al.

The indigenous climate migration ecosystem in Peru \nThere  are  roughly  4  million  indigenous  people  living  in  Peru,  making  up  55  indigenous  nations\n168\n, \naccording to the International Working Group for Indigenous Affairs. \nThere are several well recognised indigenous representative organisations throughout Peru. For example, \nthe Amarakaeri ECA, an indigenous organisation made up of ten native communities, manages and promotes \nthe protection and holistic management of the Amarakaeri Communal Reserve (RCA).\n169\n Associations such \nas the Interethnic Association for the Development of the Peruvian Jungle (AIDESEP) and Coordinator of the \nIndigenous Organisations of the Amazon Basin (COICA), are working towards common goals of protecting \nindigenous  ancestral  land,  promoting  planetary  health  and  guaranteeing  indigenous  rights.\n170,171\n    These \norganisations  have  leadership  boards  consisting  of  representatives  from  each  participating  community,  \nselected by the communities themselves.\n172,173,174\n  \nThe   relationship   between   the   Peruvian   government   and   indegenous   communities   is   undergoing   \nconsiderable  changes,  as  these  communities  organise  and  develop  their  own  governing  bodies.\n175\n  For \nexample,  in  2015,  the  Wampis  People  of  Peru  declared  the  ‘formation  of  the  first  Autonomous  Indigenous  \nGovernment  in  Peru’  with  a  goal  of  preserving  1.3  million  hectare  of  ancestral  territory  and  encouraging  \nsustainability and harmony with the national world.\n176\n The national government has recognised indigenous \npeople  as  extremely  vulnerable  to  the  impacts  of  climate  change  and  at  a  high  risk  of  potential  \ndisplacement.\n177\n  \nThere  are  small,  non-governmental  actors active  in  Peru,  such  as  Hivos\n178\n,  which  provides  support  to  \nindigenous  organisations  through  its  All  Eyes  On  the  Amazon  programme,  and  Climate  Refugees,  an  \norganisation based in New York that provides vital insights into underlying climate drivers of displacement and \nmigration.\n179\n There are also larger, multinational organisations such as the International Organisation for \nMigration  and  the  Internal  Displacement  Monitoring  Centre,  which  support  international  action related  to  \nclimate migration and displacement.  \n  \n \n168 \nInternational Working Group on Indigenous Affairs (2021), ‘Indigenous Peoples of Peru’, https://www.iwgia.org/en/peru.html  \n169 \nECA Amarakaeri (2022), ‘Amarakaeri Communal Reserve: Conservation with Effective Participation of Indigenous Peoples’, \nhttps://amarakaeri.org/conservacion-participacion-pueblos-indigenas  \n170 \nAsociación Interétnica de Desarrollo de La Selva Peruana (2022), ‘What We Want’, http://www.aidesep.org.pe/que-\nqueremos-interno  \n171 \nCoordinadora de las Organizaciones Indígenas de la Cuenca Amazónica (2022), ‘About COICA’, \nhttps://coicamazonia.org/somos/  \n172 \nIbid. \n173 \nECA Amarakaeri (2022), ‘About us’, https://amarakaeri.org/eca-amarakaeri \n174 \nAsociación Interétnica de Desarrollo de La Selva Peruana (2022), ‘About us’, http://www.aidesep.org.pe/quienes-somos-\ninterno \n175 \nCregan, F., Intercontinental Cry (2015), ‘Wampis Nation Establishes The First Autonomous Indigenous Government In \nPeru’, https://intercontinentalcry.org/wampis-nation-establishes-the-first-autonomous-indigenous-government-in-peru/  \n176 \nIbid. \n177 \nMinistry of the Environment, Ministry of Women, Government of Peru (2015), ‘Plan de Acción en Género y Cambio Climático \ndel Perú (PAGCC-Perú)’, https://www.climatelinks.org/sites/default/files/asset/document/2015_IUCN_Climate-Change-Gender-\nAction-Plan-Peru.pdf \n178 \nHivos, & Greenpeace (2022), ‘All Eyes on the Amazon’, https://alleyesontheamazon.org/  \n179 \nClimate Refugees (2022), ‘What We Do’, https://www.climate-refugees.org/foundingvision  \n\nEnabling Data Sharing for Social Benefit Through Data Trusts: Data Trusts in Climate \n40 \n \nSeveral academic  institutions  are  involved  in  the  study  of  climate-driven  internal  displacement.  These  \ninclude programmes such as Stanford Earth, which focuses on researching planned relocation as a form of \nclimate  adaptation,  and  the  University  of  Liège’s  Hugo  Observatory,  an  interdisciplinary  research  centre  \ndedicated to the study of human migration and its relation to environmental changes and policy.\n180,181 \n \n4.3.3. The opportunity to improve how data is stewarded \nClimate as a driver of migration and displacement is notoriously difficult to identify. It was recently discovered, \nfor example, that future migration caused by rising sea levels had been underestimated by a factor of three, \nwith new estimates showing roughly 150 million people at risk of displacement by 2050.\n182\n This difficulty was \nsomething repeatedly expressed by participants in our co-design phase. \nMigrants  will  often  identify  economic  reasons  for  moving,  such  as  low  crop  yields  without  recognising  that  \nslow-onset climate change is a driving factor. As a result of this, one of the most important methods used to \nunderstand  climate  migration  is  qualitative  interviews  with  displaced  people.  At  the  moment,  only  a  few  \norganisations  are  carrying  these  out  with  a  climate  focus,  including  non-governmental  organisations  like  \nClimate Refugees, and academic institutions such as the University of Liège and Stanford. These are typically \nconducted  in  a  semi-structured  format,  with  recorded  verbal  consent.  This  style  of  data  collection  allows  \ninterviewers  to  investigate  underlying  drivers  of  displacement  that  are  easily  missed  on  more  structured  \nmethods such as surveys. \nA number of our participants indicated that, while this type of research provided vital information on climate \ndisplacement, these institutions can hold data away from the indigenous communities and organisations the \ndata  originates  from.  Combined  with  the  fact  that  many  of  these  institutions  are  based  in  the  global  north,  \nrather than in Peru or the wider South American region, some criticised this as ‘data extractivism’.  \nHowever, indigenous groups across the Amazon have begun using data themselves to advocate for increased \nland rights, the application of indigenous land stewardship and stronger climate legislation.\n183\n All Eyes on the \nAmazon,  for  example,\n184\n  alongside  Mapeo  and  Global  Forest  Watch,  have  been  identifying  and  mapping  \ndeforestation, illegal mining and oil production in their territories and indigenous communities have used this \ndata to launch investigations that hold these operations accountable.\n185\n  \n  \n \n180 \nField, C., & Bower, E.

The potential of a data trust in this domain \nIndigenous  communities  and  organisations  could  come  together  to  form  a  climate  and  displacement  data  \ntrust,  electing  representatives  to  act  as  trustees.  The  data  trust  in  this  context  could  act  as  a  steward  of  \nqualitative  datasets  related  to  climate  migration  from  across  Peru,  ensuring  that  the  data  is  shared  with  \ntrustworthy organisations, and importantly, is accessible to displaced people themselves. As we describe in \nlater sections, it could provide a powerful mechanism for indigenous data stewardship. \nSimilar to the Indian small shareholder farming domain, there could be a need for field agents to collect the \ndata, in the form of recording interviews. This is because according to some of our participants, qualitative \ninformation on climate drivers of internal displacement are rare. Additionally, work done by the First Nations \nInformation Governance Centre (FNIGC) has highlighted how data collection designed and conducted by the \nindigenous  people  themselves  can  be  far  more  effective  for  their  causes,  than  methods  designed  and  \ncollected by non-indigenous groups.\n187\n There would also be potential for the data trust to partner with groups \nfocusing on these areas such as academics, humanitarian organisations and migration researchers, to help \ndevelop and facilitate data collection.  \nThe data collected could be aggregated, processed to ensure privacy and security, and shared with relevant \nstakeholders  according  to  the  terms  set  out  by  trust  members.  These  stakeholders  could  include  climate  \nadvocacy  groups,  environmental  defenders,  humanitarian  organisations,  and  academic  and  research  \ninstitutions. These stakeholders could use this data to gain a better understanding of the underlying climate-\ndrivers  of  human  mobility.  Participants  suggested  that  the  datasets  could  also  be  used  to  train  machine  \nlearning  models  to  create  more  accurate  predictive  models  of  future  climate  driven  human  migration  and  \ndisplacement. These models could help governments and communities prepare for changes in their urban \nand rural areas and ensure that resources are funnelled into the regions that need it the most. Most importantly \nhowever, these datasets could be applied by the indigenous nations themselves in cases related to land rights, \nindigenous environmental stewardship and active investigations into illegal mining and deforestation activities \nthat put them at greater risk for climate-driven displacement. \n \n186 \nAsociación Interétnica de Desarrollo de La Selva Peruana (2022), ‘What We Want’, http://www.aidesep.org.pe/que-\nqueremos-interno  \n187 \nFirst Nations Information Governance Centre, ‘Our Impact’, https://fnigc.ca/about-fnigc/our-impact/  \n\nEnabling Data Sharing for Social Benefit Through Data Trusts: Data Trusts in Climate \n42 \n \nFigure 6: a potential data trust for indigenous climate migration in Peru \n \nDuring  the  co-design  phase  for  this  domain,  we  engaged  with  organisations  with  experience  working  with  \nindigenous  groups  in  Peru  such  as  Climate  Refugees,  Hivos/All  Eyes  on  the  Amazon,  International  \nOrganisation for Migration, Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre, International Service for Human Rights \nand Refugees International. \nParticipants in the co-design process, especially those who were working on the ground in direct collaboration \nwith  indigenous  people  in  Peru,  were  confident  that  these  communities  were  highly  motivated  to  establish  \ngreater ownership and control over their data, and to participate in data collection themselves. They described \nthat in response to the impact climate changes are having on their lives – including forced displacement, loss \nof ancestral lands and customs, and adverse impacts on their health and wellbeing – many communities have \nalready developed data-sharing agreements and data-collection programmes, to help advocate for action. \nHowever,  they  indicated  that  a  data  trust  in  this  context  may  need  to  look  different  to  those  in  other  \ngeographical and cultural environments. One participant described how the definitions and interpretations of \nconcepts like ‘bottom-up stewardship’ and ‘data trusts’ may need to be adapted in this context, in recognition \nof  different  perspectives  and  worldviews.  This  is  especially  important  considering  the  number  of  unique  \n\nEnabling Data Sharing for Social Benefit Through Data Trusts: Data Trusts in Climate \n43 \n \nindigenous nations in Peru – each with its own views and requirements for how these concepts should be \napplied to its people, potentially leading to several different interpretations. \n \nFigure 7: Storyboard indicating how a potential data trust in this domain could function\n \n  \n\nEnabling Data Sharing for Social Benefit Through Data Trusts: Data Trusts in Climate \n44 \n \n4.3.5. Legal underpinnings of the data trust \nPeru  first  introduced  the  right  to  data  protection  in  1993,  and  established  the  Peruvian  Data  Protection \nAuthority  to  oversee  both  past  and  subsequent  legislation.\n188\n  Since  then,  it  has  enacted  several  laws  and  \nregulations related to data rights and privacy including Law number 29733 on the Protection of Personal Data, \nLaw number 30096 on Cyber Crime, and Emergency Decree Number 007-2020 which includes measures to \nguarantee confidentiality of information.\n189\n \nWhile these laws provide important legislative protection and rights to personal data, applying a data trust in \nthis domain involves considerable challenges related to the sensitivity of both the data being collected and \nthe  population  it  is  being  collected  from.  In  the  Plan  of  Action  on  Gender  and  Climate  Change  in  Peru,  \ncommissioned by the Peruvian Government, indigenous communities were repeatedly identified as one of the \nmost vulnerable populations to the impacts of climate change.\n190\n These vulnerabilities come from a series of \nfactors including language barriers, access to resources, cultural differences, legislative barriers to land rights \nand indigenous  governance,  and  limited  access  to  education.  Indigenous  Peruvians  have  also  faced  \ndiscrimation from both national and international governments as well as non-idigenous communities in Peru, \nincluding targeted and sometimes lethal attacks on indigenous land defenders.\n191\n \nThis raises significant concerns regarding potential risks to the personal safety of communities from whom \ndata would originate. In general, while we believe that there is an opportunity to improve how data is stewarded \nin this domain, policymakers and other practitioners should seek to apply data trusts – an unproven form of \nstewardship – in other domains first. \nHowever, if it did come to establishing a data trust like this in law, Peru has trust law through law 26702 the \nGeneral Law of the Financial and Insurance Systems and Organic Law of the Superintendence of Banking \nand Insurance. This legislation does allow for settlors to transfer rights, stating ‘the essential requirement of \nvalidity for the constitution of the trust is that the settlor has the power to dispose of the assets and rights to \nbe transferred’.\n192\n In theory, this could support the rights of displaced people to transfer their data rights to a \ndata  trust.  It  is  important  to  note  however,  that  at  this  time,  the  legal  frameworks  around  trust  law  in  Peru  \npertain primarily to the financial and banking systems, leaving significant questions regarding how it may be \napplied to data. Due to this, it is possible that a data trust in this country would need to take on a different \nlegal form, perhaps of a corporation.  \n  \n \n188 \nTovar, T. & Buleje, C.

Potential trustees and decision making within the data trust \nIn  this  domain,  the  most  suitable  candidates  for  trustees  of  the  data  trust  would  be  the  indigenous \norganisations already operating in the region, such as those mentioned in 4.3.2. These groups have extensive \nexperience  working  with  both  national  and  international  organisations,  knowledge  of  data  stewardship  and  \ndrafting data sharing agreements, and a social responsibility of fiduciary-like duties towards their communities. \nAdditionally,  these  organisations  already  have  systems  for  electing  indigenous  representatives  to  the  \norganisations’ boards, indicating that a similar process could be used for selecting organisation members to \nsit on the board of trustees of the data trust.\n193\n \nParticipants in our co-design phase suggested that if any non-indigenous representatives were to sit on the \nboard, they would need to be selected by the indigenous communities themselves, or by the representative \norganisations on behalf of their communities. \nTrustees  would  have  the  responsibility  of  protecting  the  data  and  ensuring  that  any  sharing  and  uses  of  it  \nfurther the objectives laid out by the indigenous communities. This would be especially important during times \nof displacement,  when  communities  are  most  vulnerable.  Many  of  these  indigenous  organisations  have  \nexperience  negotiating  data  sharing  agreements,  collecting  data,  organising  protection  for  data  collection  \nprogrammes  and  applying  data  to  climate  initiatives  and  objectives.\n194\n  Indeed,  it  could  be  that  an  existing  \nidigneous organisation could itself take on the role of the data trust. \nOne  of  our  participants  described  that,  based  on  their  experience,  indigenous  cultures  in  Peru  may  have  \nwholly different understandings and outlooks towards community and decision-making than the practitioners \nand policymakers in the West working on data trusts. In practice, this could mean that decision-making within \nthis context could involve elected representatives discussing data preferences at community meetings and \nthen communicating them to trustees. \nOutside  of  this  domain,  there  is  significant  progress  being  made  in  indigenous  data  governance  and  \nsovereignty, which could inform the design of the data trust’s governance and decision making. Examples of \nindigenous  data  stewardship  across  the  globe  – such  as  the  First  Nations  Information  Governance  Centre  \n(FNIGC) in Canada, the Te Mana Raruanga/the Māori Data Sovereignty Network in New Zealand and the \nGlobal Indigenous Data Alliance – are reference points for how data trusts could be governed\n195,\n. The CARE \nPrinciples  for  Indigenous  Data  Governance  provide  a  starting  point  for  indigenous  communities  seeking  to  \nbuild their own data stewardship and governance models, addressing collective benefit, authority to control, \nresponsibility and ethics.\n196\n \n  \n \n193 \nAsociación Interétnica de Desarrollo de La Selva Peruana, ‘About us’, http://www.aidesep.org.pe/index.php/quienes-somos-\ninterno  \n194 \nÅhrén, M. et al.

Digital infrastructure and technology \nParticipants in our co-design phase suggested that qualitative data could be collected through a smartphone \nor desktop app, or voice recording software. Several indigenous communities are already working with data \ncollection software such as Mapeo and Global Forest Watch, and organisations working on data collection \nwith internally displaced persons have found accessibility to basic technology such as mobile phones and the \ninternet to be common.\n197\n \nA concern presented to us was limited access to technology – such as virtual private clouds – to  securely  \nmaintain and store the data, and capacity to build and deploy it. One participant described how, in some parts \nof Peru, ‘to have information is super expensive’. \nAn area for optimism in this domain was the potential for a data trust to enable access to data at scale sufficient \nto apply natural language processing (NLP). GPAI Responsible AI Working Group’s report on Climate Change \nand  AI  highlighted  the  potential  for  NLP  techniques  to  allow  AI  application  to  qualitative  data  such  as  \ninterviews.\n198\n However, the potential in this context may be limited due to the fact that over 26% of Peru’s \npopulation do not speak Spanish as a first language, and a majority of those individuals are indigenous.\n199\n \nThis  could  provide  an  opportunity  to  create  a  language  corpus,  as  discussed  in  GPAI  Data  Governance  \nWorking Group’’s report on the Role of Data in AI\n200\n, and trustees could choose to donate data to initiatives \nlike Common Voice.\n201\n  \n4.3.8. Financial sustainability \nOur participants found it difficult to pinpoint what a critical mass would look like for a data trust in this context. \nHowever,  due  to  the  qualitative  nature  of  the  data  being  collected,  it  was  suggested  that  the  numbers  of  \ninterviews would likely be quite low. This could mean that a data trust in this context could require fairly small \namounts of investment to get started and begin having impact (although storing audio and related data could \nincrease costs over time).  \nIn discussions of potential funding sources, most experts agreed that philanthropic investments were the most \nrealistic  route  for  establishing  a  data  trust  in  this  context,  especially  given  that  the  types  of  organisations  \nseeking  to  use  data  stewarded  by  the  data  trust  would  include  non-profits –  including  legal  agencies,  \nhumanitarian organisations, academic and research institutions and environmental advocates. However, this \nfunding route would need to be approached with caution to ensure that it didn’t jeopardise the integrity of the \ntrust (such as by influencing the decisions made by trustees). \n  \n \n197 \nSánchez, N.

Assessing the Feasibility of Data Trusts for These Domains  \nBased on the information generated through our co-design phase and documented in this section, we assess \nthe feasibility of data trusts for the three domains as follows: \nCriteria \nA data trust for \ncycling in London  \nA data trust for small \nshareholder farming \nin India \nA data trust for \nindigenous climate \nmigration in Peru \n1. Is there an \nincentive for the \ncommunity to come \ntogether to create  \na data trust? \n+ There is demand  \nfor improved cycling \ninfrastructure among \nthe London cycling \ncommunity and \ncoalescing around  \na data trust has the \npotential to advocate \nfor and impact that. \n-  We could not identify  \na clear incentive for \nsmall shareholder \nfarmers in India to come \ntogether to form a data \ntrust, especially in the \ncontext of other pressing \nchallenges and priorities.  \n+ There is demand  \nfor increased control \nand use of data by \nindigenous communities \nin Peru for a number  \nof different purposes, \nincluding to advocate \nfor increased land \nrights. \n2. Do members  \nof the community \nhave the capacity  \nto engage in the \ndevelopment and \nrunning of a data \ntrust? \n+ Londoners generally \nhave a high level  \nof digital literacy,  \nand some cyclists are \nalready generating \nand using mobility \ndata through mobile \napps and other \nservices (although \nlevels of capability will \nnot be uniform and \nmay vary by area  \nof London). \n-  There is a distinct  \nlack of digital literacy  \nin the Indian farmer \ncommunity, and limited \ninternet connectivity  \nalso poses a significant \nchallenge to data \ncollection, sharing  \nand use. \n± There is growing use \nof data by indingenous \ncommunities in Peru, \nhowever specific \nindigenous nations  \nand communities may \nhave lower levels of \ndigital literacy.  \n3. Is there a person, \ngroup or organisation \nwho can credibly \ndrive the \ndevelopment of  \na data trust with  \nthe community? \n± We encountered \norganisations keen  \nto support the \ndevelopment of a data \ntrust to help improve \ncycling infrastructure, \nincluding Transport  \nfor London and the \nLondon Cycling \nCampaign). \n± In theory,  \ncommunity-level farmer \norganisations and civil \nsociety organisations \ncould take up the task  \nof working with farmers \nto take the idea forward.  \n+ There are \norganisations with \nexperience in  \ndata collection  \nand indigenous \nrepresentation that \ncould take the lead on \nbuilding (and potentially \nhosting/ operating)  \na data trust. \n\nEnabling Data Sharing for Social Benefit Through Data Trusts: Data Trusts in Climate \n48 \n \n4. Is there demand \nfor the data among \nprospective users, \nwith clearly bound \nuse cases for it? \n+ There is high \ndemand for mobility \ndata from those \nundertaking modelling \nand making decisions \nabout London’s \ncycling infrastructure, \nas well as startups, \nadvocacy \norganisations  \nand academia. \n± There is some  \ndemand for more local \nfarming data from \nresearch institutions  \nand AgTech firms, \nincluding to develop \ntailored advisories and to \nsupport AI development.  \n-  There is some \ndemand from civil \nsociety organisations \nseeking to use the data \nto better understand \nmigration patterns,  \nand from indigneous \ncommunities \nthemselves (but  \nlimited in the context  \nof developing/ \ndeploying AI).  \n5. Are there  \ndata rights in the \njurisdiction that \nindividuals from the \ncommunity could \ndelegate to the  \ndata trust? \n± The UK GDPR \nrecognises individual \nrights over data, but it \nremains to be proven \nwhether those rights \ncan be delegated to  \na data trust. \n-  There is no data \nprotection legislation  \nin India and therefore  \nno rights that could be \ndelegated to a data trust, \nand limited guardrails  \nto experiment safely  \nwith this form of  \ndata stewardship. \n-  The current legislation \nregarding data rights \nand transfer is not \nsubstantial or clear \nenough to confidently \nsupport the transfer  \nof rights.  \n6. Are there legal \ninstruments in the \njurisdiction that could \nbe used to construct \na data trust and \nestablish fiduciary \nobligations to the \ncommunity? \n+ There are a number \nof organisational \nforms that could be \nused to construct the \ndata trust such as the \nCompany Limited by \nGuarantee, and the \nuse of ‘true’ legal \ntrusts could also  \nbe tested. \n± While legal trusts  \nin India are not suitable \nas a legal structure for \ndata trusts, other \norganisational structures \nsuch as registered \nsocieties could provide  \na suitable basis to set up \na data trust. \n± Trust law exists in \nPeru, however it is \nunclear if this could be \napplied to construct  \na data trust. \n7. Is it \ntechnologically \npossible for the  \ndata trust to exert \ncontrol over the  \ndata it would be \nresponsible for? \n+ A mobile app could \nbe used to collect \nGPS and motion data, \nsimilar to the way that \nother mobility services \nfunction (and porting \ndata from other \nservices/apps could \nalso be possible). \n± Tools like SurveyCTO \nto enable offline \ncollection of data in \nareas of low internet \nconnectivity, although \ninteroperability driven by \na lack of common data \nstandards could inhibit \nefforts to aggregate and \nmake use of the data.  \n± The qualitative data \ncould be collected \nthrough a smartphone \napp or voice recording \nsoftware, although \naccess to virtual private \nclouds to securely \nmaintain and store the \ndata may be a barrier. \n\nEnabling Data Sharing for Social Benefit Through Data Trusts: Data Trusts in Climate \n49 \n \n8. Is there access  \nto sufficient funding \nto set up the data \ntrust, and options to \nensure its continued \nsustainability? \n± Options for funding \ninclude philanthropic \nfunders interested in \ncommunity initiatives \nand/or data \nstewardship, and  \na data trust could \nexperiment with \ndifferent revenue \nmodels if it needed  \nto sustain itself. \n-  We struggled to identify \npotential funding sources \nfor a data trust, \nespecially given that \nfunding for data \ninitiatives in agriculture  \nin India is limited in \ngeneral. \n± Philanthropic funding \ncould be a route for \nestablishing a data trust \nin this context, although \nit’s unclear whether \nthere would be ways for \nit to become self-\nsustaining. \n \nWe came to the conclusion that applying the London Cyclist Data Trust would be the most feasible – largely \non  the  basis  of  there  being  a  clear  incentive  for  the  community  of  cyclists  to  engage,  high  levels  of  digital  \ncapacity in the community, an ecosystem of credible organisations interested in supporting its development, \nand clear uses for the data it would seek to bring together.  \n\nEnabling Data Sharing for Social Benefit Through Data Trusts: Data Trusts in Climate \n50 \n \n5. A Roadmap for Operationalising a Climate Data Trust \nThis roadmap is based on our design of the London Cycling Data Trust, but could be used to take forward a \nsimilar  data  trust  in  other  locations\n202\n.  It  is  not  exhaustive,  but  we  hope  it  serves  as  a  useful  reference  for  \npractitioners seeking to implement a climate data trust. \nIt is intended to be undertaken by a person or organisation who can credibly drive the development of the \ndata trust with the given community (for example, in the context of the London Data Trust this could be the \nLondon Cycling Campaign), with sufficient funding. \nWhile the steps are highly interrelated, we set them out across five streams: \n \nFigure 8: Five streams to operationalise a data trust \nCommunity: \n•   Conduct extensive engagement and user research with the cyclist community to develop  \na detailed understanding of their expectations and needs from the data trust. \n•   Evaluate and adjust for the variation in capacity and levels of engagement within the citizen group \n(for instance – how do the concerns and interests differ by gender, ethnicity or location?). \n•   Engage with prospective data users to understand the potential use cases and the data needed  \nto undertake them, as well as the technological means of access they require. \n•   Consider how value and impact will be communicated back to the community as a result  \nof the data collection and use (for instance, communicating when cycle lanes have been  \nbuilt or improved). \n•   Develop mechanisms for ongoing participation and decision making with the cyclist group \nregarding the overall nature and direction of the data trust. \n  \n \n202 \nBuilding on previous work on the implementation of bottom-up data stewardship, including by the Data Trusts Initiative. See: \nhttps://datatrusts.uk/blogs/creating-a-  pathway-to-successful-real-world-data-trusts. \n\nEnabling Data Sharing for Social Benefit Through Data Trusts: Data Trusts in Climate \n51 \n \nCapacity: \n•   Identify and recruit for (or engage delivery partners with) the different skills required to set up and \nrun the data trust, such as those with specialist knowledge and experience in compliance, \noperations, finance, technology, design, data stewardship and community engagement. \n•   Identify and recruit trustees, considering the diversity and balance of perspectives and interests to \nbe represented to ensure responsible data stewardship.  \n \nLegal and governance: \n•   Further evaluate the potential legal forms the data trust could take, such as a legal trust  \nor company limited by guarantee. Consider whether an existing organisation could host/take  \non the role of the data trust. \n•   Consider how the fiduciary responsibilities of the trustees can be made contextual and explicit,  \nand sufficient in safeguarding the interests of the cyclists. \n•   Undertake appropriate privacy impact assessments, as well as consider the ethical implications  \nof the data trust’s activities (for example, using tools like the ODI Data Ethics Canvas\n203\n  \nor Consequence Scanning\n204\n). \n•   Design a detailed set of terms for how the data trust will make different types of decisions  \n(for example, granular decisions about which third parties can access the data it stewards,  \nas well as strategic decisions about the revenue models it might need to adopt). \n•   Address the question of whether and how the delegation of data rights is possible (for example,  \nin the context of the London Data Trust, if UK GDPR permits cyclists to delegate rights  \nto the data trust).  \n•   Develop legal agreements to use to constrain third parties’ use of the data, and means  \nof enforcement and redress.  \n•   Register/incorporate the chosen legal form (for example, by registering the company limited  \nby guarantee with Companies House and completing statutory documentation).  \n \n \n \n \n \n203 \nThe Open Data Institute (2021), ‘The Data Ethics Canvas’, https://theodi.org/article/the-data-ethics-canvas-2021/  \n204 \nDoteveryone (2021), ‘Consequence Scanning – an agile practice for responsible innovators’ \nhttps://doteveryone.org.uk/project/consequence-scanning/  \n\nEnabling Data Sharing for Social Benefit Through Data Trusts: Data Trusts in Climate \n52 \n \nTechnology: \n•   Develop, test and refine prototypes of the data trust’s interface (in the case of the London  \nData Trust, building on the initial wireframes for the Positive Cycling app). \n•   Build back-end systems to securely ingress, host and combine data, if required.  \n•   Build appropriate mechanisms to enable third parties, as deemed appropriate by trustees,  \nto access the data (for example, using Trusted Research Environments or deploying Privacy \nEnhancing Technologies to restrict access). Consider means of auditing and enforcement to \nensure data use are in line with the preferences of the community and as agreed by trustees. \n•   Explore different technological functions the data trust could itself take on, such as undertaking \nanalysis or developing data visualisations. \n \nScale and sustainability: \n•   Identify (and if required, implement) approaches to generating revenue, such as charging  \nsome users for access to data. \n•   Undertake a campaign to make cyclists aware of the data trust and encourage them to get \ninvolved (for instance, in the case of the London Cycle Data Trust, to launch and advertise  \nthe Positive Cycle mobile app). \n•   Begin to consider options for scaling the data trusts, such as by increasing its geographical \ncoverage or ability to responsibly steward other data types. \n \n \n\nEnabling Data Sharing for Social Benefit Through Data Trusts: Data Trusts in Climate \n53 \n \n6. Conclusion \nIn the course of this research, we have identified several themes and reached conclusions about data trusts \nas a form of data stewardship: \n1. On the feasibility and next steps for the three climate domains: \nWe’re  optimistic  about  the  potential  for  a  London  Cycle  Data  Trust  and  other,  similar  data  trusts  to  \nemerge  to  enable  communities  to  use  data  to  advocate  for,  and  inform  the  design  of,  sustainable  \ntransport  infrastructure.  Existing  initiatives  such  as  Posmo.Coop  and  the  Bike  Data  Project  show  that  \nthere  is  interest  and  motivation  among  communities  and  that  there  are  defined  uses  for  data  in  this  \ncontext, as well as momentum behind the idea.  \nWhile  the  feasibility  of  data  trusts  for  small  shareholder  farming  in  India  or  for  indigenous  climate  \nmigration in Peru is less certain, there are clearly opportunities to improve how data is collected, used \nand shared in these areas and we hope this work serves to highlight them. \n2. On the process of co-designing data trusts: \nWe set out to involve diverse groups of stakeholders in the co-design of the three data trusts. We were \nable to include participants with different perspectives and interests, and from different parts of the world. \nWe  hope  that  the  combination  of  research  and  design  methods  we’ve  used  will  help  to  move  the  \ndiscussion of data trusts from the theory (with the common placeholder of ‘it depends’) to a more specific \ndiscussion, anchored in tangible descriptions of how they could look and function in practice. \nHowever, we're aware of the limitations of this co-design process. Given the timescale of the project,  \nwe used desk research and expert interviews to select the domains, rather than an open call. We did  \nnot  pursue  direct  communication  with  London  cyclists  and  displaced  indigenous  communities  in  this  \nproject, and had limited exposure to smaller shareholder farmers in India. Therefore the three designs \nare  based  on  the  needs  of  these  communities  as  documented  in  literature  or  as  understood   \nby stakeholders who work closely with them. We recommend that practitioners exploring data trusts in \nthese  domains  –  and in  general,  researching  or  designing  data  trusts  –  consider  more  participatory  \napproaches over a longer period. \n3. On the general feasibility of data trusts: \nData  trusts  differ  from  other  approaches  to  bottom-up  data  stewardship  by  having  a)  independent  \ntrustees with b) explicit, contextual fiduciary obligations. We feel the significant discourse around possible \nlegal instruments to apply these functions can distract from other important conditions necessary for data \ntrusts  to  emerge.  As  our  feasibility  criteria  describe,  a  clear  incentive  for  a  community  to  mobilise,  \ncapacity for them to do so and appropriate leadership are vital.  \nWe’re conscious that the concept of data trusts can sometimes become detached from existing bottom-\nup  data  stewardship  initiatives,  such  as  those  we  list  in  Section  2.  Their  existence  shows  that  \ncommunities can be empowered around their data without the need for trustees with this particular type \nof duty. Therefore these functions are not only difficult to fulfil, but the need for them also remains to be \nproven. To do so, we perhaps not only require a real-world data trust to provide a comparison, but also \nfor  that  data  trust  and  a  similar  initiative  to  ‘go  wrong’  to  then  be  able  to  analyse  the  comparative  \noutcomes (and validate that having trustees with fiduciary obligations provides increased protections). \n\nEnabling Data Sharing for Social Benefit Through Data Trusts: Data Trusts in Climate \n54 \n \nThis  may  be  a  long  way  off,  potentially  enabling  data  trusts  to  exist  as  a  rich  theoretical  debate  that  \ndetracts from the pragmatic and impactful work of real-world initiatives.     \n4. On other approaches to responsible data stewardship for AI: \nExperimentation  around  data  trusts  and  other  forms  of  bottom-up  data  stewardship  is  important.  \nHowever, data can be stewarded responsibly without requiring this level of individual control, which will \nnot work for everyone. In general, as with this research, we are still exploring the contexts where these \napproaches to data are viable and useful. \nEven where they are, such as in the case of the London Cycle Data Trust, data trusts are likely to grow \nslowly,  and  the  collective  dataset  the  cycling  community  creates  may  not  ever  meet  AI  practitioners'  \nneeds for data at scale. For policymakers and other actors interested in data stewardship as a means of \nsupporting  the  development  and  application  of  AI,  we  recommend  considering  other  approaches  \nalongside  data  trusts.  For  example:  platforms  that  enable  people  to  donate  data  to  create  new  data  \nassets  at  scale  (see  Mozilla’s  Common  Voice\n205\n);  hubs  that  provide  infrastructure  that  enable  \norganisations  to  come  together  to  share  data  with  researchers  securely  (see  INSIGHT  Health  Data  \nResearch Hub\n206\n); or organisations publishing data that can be used to train AI models (see Waymo’s \nautonomous vehicles sensor data\n207\n). \n5. On the role for GPAI and other policymakers: \nWe  appreciate  GPAI’s  commitment  to  exploring  new  forms  of  data  stewardship.  Based  on  our  \nexperiences with this research, we recommend that the GPAI Data Governance Working Group: \n•   undertakes work to imagine (and assess the feasibility of) other new forms of data stewardship,  \nto inspire data governance practitioners and demonstrate the array of options open to them.  \n•   documents initiatives that already steward data responsibly for AI development and application,  \nto amplify best practices and bridge the gap between forward-looking research and the real world. \n•   provides access to long-term funding and other resources, to enable practitioners to attempt to \nimplement data trusts (such as the London Cycle Data Trust) and other forms of data stewardship. \nOther policymakers helping to advance the understanding and practice of responsible data governance \nmay also consider these proposed next steps.   \n \n205 \nCommon Voice, https://commonvoice.mozilla.org/en  \n206 \nINSIGHT Health Data Research Hub, https://www.insight.hdrhub.org  \n207 \nWaymo, https://github.com/waymo-research/waymo-open-dataset  \n\nEnabling Data Sharing for Social Benefit Through Data Trusts: Data Trusts in Climate \n55 \n \nMethodology \nSelecting Climate Domains to Focus on \nIn  October  2021,  we  initiated  this  research  which  aimed  to  assess  the  feasibility  of  data  trusts  for  climate  \naction.  We  undertook  a  review  of  climate  literature  and  conducted    interviews  with  experts  to  deepen  our  \nunderstanding of the field and generate a longlist of climate challenges to start from. \nThe  literature  review  examined  scientific  and  grey  literature.  The  goal  of  the  review  was  to  gain  a  broad  \nunderstanding  of  the  key  issues  in  climate  change,  and  how  data  and  AI  were  being  deployed  to  address  \nthem.  We  undertook  17  interviews  with  experts  in  this  phase  to  supplement  our  review,  with  interviewees  \nselected for their expertise in the areas of data stewardship, climate, data science and analysis, and artificial \nintelligence.  The  research  team  created  topic  guides  to  steer  the  interviews,  and  each  interview  lasted  \nbetween 45 minutes and one hour. \nFollowing this initial process, we generated the following, non-exhaustive longlist of climate challenges: city \nmobility; energy use; agriculture; community resilience; climate  migration; water use; wildlife conservation; \nand air quality. \nRather than focusing on one challenge or trying to design one general-purpose climate data trust to tackle all \nchallenges,  we  chose  to  narrow  down  to  three  domains.  Using  domains  as  case  studies  was  intended  to  \nincrease the likelihood of a data trust ultimately being built (that is, to ‘spread our bets’), as well as broaden \nthe range of things we would learn about data trusts as an approach to data stewardship. We developed a set \nof four criteria to aid the selection of three domains: \n1. Can data play a critical role in tackling the challenges faced in this domain?  \n2. Can data from this domain be used to develop or deploy artificial intelligence? \n3. Are there opportunities in this domain for bottom-up approaches that empower individuals to play \na role in stewarding data?  \n4. Would focusing on this domain help us to explore privacy (and other rights)  \nenhancing technologies?  \nWe  applied  these  criteria  using  RAG (Red-Amber-Green)  ratings,  using  the  information  generated  through  \nour co-design process to summarise favourable (Green), neutral (Amber) and unfavourable (Red) values. We \nused the RAG ratings to inform the following decisions: \nTo combine the city mobility, water use, energy use and air quality domains under a new  \ndomain of ‘city sustainability’. This change was made after recognising overlaps between several  \nof the associated data types and systems, and the potential to focus the application of a data  \ntrust within a particular city or urban environment, which came through as a common theme  \nin our expert interviews. \n\nEnabling Data Sharing for Social Benefit Through Data Trusts: Data Trusts in Climate \n56 \n \nTo narrow the agriculture domain to ‘small shareholder farming’. This choice was made after feedback from \nseveral stakeholders that the agriculture domain was too broad and that ‘big agriculture’ (encompassing \nlarge commercial farms owned by corporations ) would offer  \nlimited opportunities to explore bottom-up data stewardship. \nTo select the climate migration domain. Our research suggested that data trusts could represent a powerful \ntool for climate migrants that would ensure the data collected about them was protected and used in their \ninterests, which unfortunately isn’t always the case currently.  \nWe also sought to explore these domains through different geographic and jurisdictional lenses, to assess the \nfeasibility of data trusts in diverse socio-economic and legal contexts. The following choices of locations also \ntook into account practical considerations, such as the networks developed and prior research conducted by \nthe ODI and Aapti Institute: \nWithin the city sustainability domain, London was chosen as the ODI has a deep understanding of and \nconnections with the data ecosystem. Additionally, prior research conducted by Aapti Institute showed that \ntrusts' institutional and legal origins in England and Wales make them the most suitable for instantiating data \ntrusts through trust law.\n208\n  \nWithin the small shareholder farming domain, India was chosen due to Aapti Institute’s prior experience in \nevaluating the impact of data governance policies on the agriculture sector in  \nIndia\n209\n. This choice was also aided by India's legal system having a well documented and robust \njurisprudence of various legal structures – such as trusts, societies, and companies – which could be \nleveraged to set up a data trust. \nWithin the climate migration domain, Peru was chosen because of its geographical location, climate and \nenvironment, which make it extremely susceptible to climate migration. Furthermore, while both the UK and \nIndia have common law systems, Peru provided us with the opportunity to explore legal structures for data \ntrusts in a civil law jurisdiction. \nAt  the  end  of  October  2021,  GPAI’s  Data  Governance  Working  Group  confirmed  the  domains  and  their  \ngeographical   locations:   city   sustainability   (London);   small   shareholder   farming   (India);   and   climate    \nmigration (Peru). \n  \n \n208 \nAapti Institute and The Open Data Institute (2022), ‘Enabling data sharing for social benefit through data trusts’, \nhttps://gpai.ai/projects/data-governance/data-trusts/enabling-data-sharing-for-social-benefit-through-data-trusts.pdf  \n209 \nKapoor, A. et al.

The purpose of using a co-design methodology was \nto discover unique and varied perspectives, in recognition of the need to explore and develop participatory \ndata  stewardship  initiatives  in  a  collaborative  way.  As  part  of  the  process,  we  drew  from  frameworks  for  \ndeveloping data trusts provided by Aapti Institute and Data Trusts Initiative.\n210\n \nWe convened three sets of co-design participants, one for each domain. This included expert interviewees \nfrom our previous phase; respondents to our open call for participation\n211\n; and people and organisations we \nhad encountered in our research or who had been referred to us.  \nWe sought to balance domain expertise – those with an understanding of that climate area, such as its causes, \nchallenges,  main  actors  and  current  blockers  to data  collection,  use  or  sharing  –  with  expertise  in  data  \nstewardship – those  with  knowledge  of  data  trusts  and  other  approaches  to  bottom-up  data  stewardship;  \nhands-on experience in building technological systems to store data or using data to generate insights; or an \ninterest  in  the  use  of  different  legal  frameworks  to  underpin  data  stewardship.  The  full  list  of  co-design \nparticipants for each domain can be found in the Acknowledgements appendix. \nTo facilitate the discussion and input of our co-design participants, we set up a series of design templates on \nMiro,  a  digital  whiteboard  software.  This  structure  was  used  in  both  of  the  co-design  workshops  and  \nparticipants were also able to contribute to the whiteboard independently. We used a variety of templates and \ndesign techniques within the Miro boards, including stakeholder mapping, logic modelling and data ecosystem \nmapping. The Miro boards – for city sustainability\n212\n, small shareholder farming\n213\n and climate migration\n214\n – \nremain open for further contribution. \nWe undertook three main methods of co-design during this process: \nWorkshops. Workshops were held online at the end of January 2022 – one for each domain –  \nand ran for two hours with an average of 12 stakeholders participating. These workshops used  \nthe Miro boards and curated design frameworks. The agenda for the workshops was tailored to each \ndomain but broadly covered activities to improve stakeholders’ understanding; identify the potential \nproblems that a data trust could address; and design how it could function. These workshops also \nhighlighted potential issues and barriers to the development of such a data trust. We also used  \nAapti’s Stewardship Mapper\n215\n and Stewardship Navigator\n216\n, and guidance and other materials  \nfrom the Data Trusts Initiative, to brief, provide context and set some parameters for our participants.  \n \n210\n Montgomery, J.

Following the co-design workshops, we followed up with workshop attendees  \nto undertake individual discussions and co-design sessions using Miro. These sessions were recorded  \nand analysed using thematic coding. \nIndependent work. The team also undertook independent research and design work. We engaged  \na member of the ODI’s technology team to explore the high-level data architectures for data trusts;  \nand a member of Aapti Institute’s team with legal expertise, who considered the appropriate legal  \nforms for each of the developing designs. \nAs a bottom-up form of data stewardship, data trusts should interact with the individuals from the community \nwhose  data  they  are  to  steward.  This  interactive  component  of  data  trusts  is  often  overlooked  in  favour  of  \ndiscussion of their potential legal, technological or governance aspects. We sought to design what the user \njourneys and interfaces could look like for the data trusts, so worked with specialist user interface designers. \nFor the city sustainability domain we developed speculative designs for a smartphone app that would interact \nwith cyclists; whereas for small shareholder farming and climate migration we developed storyboards showing \nhow communities could engage with a data trust. \nThis process produced designs for a hypothetical data trust in each domain. Ultimately, each is the product of \ndifferent design choices, inspired by our interactions with participants and our research. \nDeveloping and Applying the Feasibility Criteria \nWe had originally set out to first undertake the co-design of the data trusts, and then develop and apply criteria \nto  assess  their  feasibility.  In  practice,  this  was  a  more  iterative  process  whereby  we  learned  about  the  \nelements of feasibility as we engaged with the domains and their co-design participants. For example, the \nneed for a strong financial, reciprocal or altruistic incentive for a community to come together around a data \ntrust became apparent as we learned about the reasons for individuals taking part in parallel city sustainability \ninitiatives like Posmo Coop. \nWe therefore developed the feasibility criteria through the co-design process, and in February 2022, made \nconclusions about each domain’s feasibility described in Section 4.4 . We applied the criteria using RAG (Red-\nAmber-Green)  ratings,  using  the  information  generated  through  our  co-design  process  to  summarise  \nfavourable  (Green),  neutral  (Amber)  and  unfavourable  (Red)  values.  Our  assessment  of  each  domain’s  \nfeasibility was then confirmed by GPAI at a red-teaming session\n217\n. This methodology could be adopted by \nsimilar projects wishing to explore the application of data trusts in a given context; in other, longer projects, \neach criteria could be the subject of extensive study. \nReport Drafting \nThis  report  was  drafted  in  February  and  March  2022,  and  launched  for  public  consultation  at  AI:UK  on  23  \nMarch 2022.  \n \n217 \nInvolving ‘the practice of rigorously challenging plans, policies, systems and assumptions by adopting an adversarial \napproach,’ https://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/red-teaming  \n\nEnabling Data Sharing for Social Benefit Through Data Trusts: Data Trusts in Climate \n59 \n \nEndnotes \nAbout Aapti Institute, the Open Data Institute, Data Trusts Initiative and \nGlobal Partnership for AI \nAapti  Institute  is  a  public  research  firm  that  works  at  the  intersection  of  technology  and  society,  building  \npolicy-relevant and actionable insights on the digital economy.
