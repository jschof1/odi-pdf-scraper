This  project  set  out  to  help  realise  the  potential  of  data  trusts  as  a  \nmechanism for trustworthy data sharing, by advancing research and practice that supports the creation of \nreal-world data trusts. \nData  trusts  are  a  type  of  data  institution  that  allows  individuals  or  groups  to  pool  resources,  tasking  an  \nindependent ‘trustee’ to manage those resources for the benefit of the trust’s members. While the specific \nmotivations of those setting up a data trust will vary in different contexts, data trusts are characterised by \ntheir focus on: \n● enabling  data-driven  innovation  for  social  and  economic  benefit,  by  creating  a  trustworthy  \nenvironment for data sharing. \n● re-balancing power asymmetries in data exchanges, by encouraging and empowering the originators \nof the data to play an active role in setting the terms of data use –   and the distribution of the value \nthat creates –   and providing a platform for collective negotiation; and \n● anticipating,  preventing,  and  managing  the  vulnerabilities  associated  with  data  use,  through  \nprofessional data stewardship. \nIn a statement earlier this year, GPAI set out some of the core functions of data trusts, based on discussions \namongst Working Group members.\n1\n This explored the distinctive contribution that data trusts can make to \ndata stewardship: by offering a vehicle for individuals or groups to choose how they want data about them to \nbe used and engaging a trustee to act for their benefit, data trusts can provide a mechanism for bottom-up \nengagement that empowers individuals and communities in decisions about data use. That statement also \nhighlighted  some  of  the  challenges  associated  with  creating  real-world  data trusts:  from  identifying  \ncommunity needs to creating strategies for implementation.  \nT\no  help  understand  current  strategies  for  operationalising  data  trusts  and  the  role  of  different  legal  \nframeworks  enabling  their  development,  GPAI  has  commissioned  the  Aapti  Institute  and  the  Open  Data  \n                                                      \n1 These functions are: provide a platform for collectives to establish desirable terms and conditions of data use, setting the constitution of a trust; appoint expert \ntrustees (professional managers) to take responsibility for the stewardship of the trust’s assets, create a regime of strong fiduciary responsibilities to bind the trustees \nto act in the interests of the trust’s members; negotiate use of trust assets in accordance with agreed terms and conditions, facilitating safe and controlled data use; \nand establish safeguards and oversight mechanisms to prevent data misuse and to take remedial action in the event of the trust’s terms and conditions being \nbreached. \n\n5 \n \nInstitute  (ODI)  to  produce  two  new  reports,  now  published  for  consultation.  A  survey  of  current  data  trust  \nprojects by the ODI and Aapti Institute collates experiences from 45 practitioners and researchers, presenting \ntheir views on what functions data trusts are delivering and what operational strategies help deliver them. In \nparallel, the Aapti Institute’s review of legal frameworks synthesises recent legal and policy developments \nsurrounding data trusts, comparing the experiences of 11 different jurisdictions.  \nWe  hope  these  reports  will  contribute  to  a  continuing  conversation  about  the  potential  of  data  trusts  in  \nenabling data sharing for social benefit. To support that dialogue, this summary presents key messages from \nthese two interim outputs.  \nLessons from current practice \nA  community  of  research  and  practice  is  already  growing  around  data  trusts.  This  community  is  trialling  \nalternative approaches to data stewardship, with the aim of empowering individuals and communities. It is \nalso changing and growing at pace, as new projects start up and grow –   80% of projects surveyed were less \nthan 5 years old or yet to be operational –   and as research and policy debates evolve. \nWhile the last few years might have been characterised by a proliferation of projects using the term ‘data \ntrust’  in  different  ways,  survey  responses  suggest  that  the  community  is  moving  towards  a  shared  \nunderstanding  of  what  data  trusts  are,  and  how  they  differ  from  other  forms  of  stewardship.  82%  of  \nrespondents agreed with the definition of data trusts that GPAI proposed in our statement earlier this year\n. \nThose disagreeing raised helpful questions about how terms like ‘data producers’ and ‘fiduciary duties’ will \nbe  interpreted  in  different  contexts,  but  were  broadly  in  alignment  with  the  idea  that  data  trusts  play  a  \ndistinctive  role  in  creating  an  environment  for  enhanced  accountability,  while  empowering  individuals  and  \ncommunities. \nThe review of working practices produced by the ODI and Aapti Institute highlights a range of innovations in \nstewardship practice that are being used by different initiatives to operationalise data trusts: \n● Practitioners  are  using  different  legal  frameworks,  including  limited  companies,  foundations,  non-\nprofits,  and  cooperatives,  adapting  to  the  opportunities  and  challenges  associated  with  the  legal  \nenvironment in which they operate. \n● Technologies being deployed to manage data vary across projects, with examples of data ‘pods’, \n‘vaults’, ‘personal data stores’ and distributed ledger-based services playing a role in operationalising \ndata management strategies. Practitioners also highlighted the role that Application Programming \nInterfaces play in helping connect data across organisations and the potential for privacy enhancing \ntechnologies to support the wider data sharing ecosystem.  \n● Different business models are emerging from efforts to make current projects financially sustainable \nover  the  long-term.  While  many  early-stage  projects  are  reliant  on  philanthropic  funding,  public  \nfunding,  private  investment  – or  other  non-earned  revenue  streams  – other  emerging  business  \nmodels use membership fees, data access fees, or data insights packages to generate revenue.  \n● With the aim of facilitating bottom-up engagement in decisions about data use, initiatives have been \ndeveloping different forms of participatory and delegated decision-making. These span a spectrum \nfrom  individual-focused  (for  example,  seeking  consent  from  individual  members  to  include  – or \nwithdraw –   their data from specific use cases), to cooperative negotiations.  \nThis  diversity  of  practices  is  allowing  projects  to  deliver  many  of  the  core  functions  of  a  data  trust,  while  \nadapting to local conditions. Projects included in this review typically reported delivering four or five of the six \ncore  data  trust  functions,  with  many  focusing  on  providing  a  platform  to  pool  data  while  establishing  \nsafeguards  and oversight  mechanisms  around  data  use.  In  one  area,  however,  a  clear  gap  is  emerging  \nbetween theory and practice: the role of trustees in enabling data stewardship remains a difficult aspect of \ndata  trusts  to  operationalise.  With  trustees  expected  to  play  an  important  role  in  increasing  accountability  \nand enforcing safeguards around data use, this gap has implications for both how data trusts can work today, \nand how the field might develop in future.  \n \n \n\n6 \n \nImplications for policymakers \nThe Aapti Institute’s review of global legal frameworks also highlights a diversity of policy approaches towards \ndata stewardship across the globe. Countries differ in: the extent to which their current legislation provides \ndata rights for individuals or communities, the ways in which those rights – where they exist –   can be enacted \nthrough data institutions; and in their ability to support or enforce fiduciary relationships between parties in a \ndata sharing arrangement.  \nExamining how legislation can facilitate data stewardship and bottom-up empowerment, this interim report \nidentifies three legislative building blocks for data trusts and other data intermediaries. These are: \n● Data rights and protections: Data trusts are a tool to help citizens enact their rights; a prerequisite \nfor their operationalisation is the existence of clear and robust data rights within a jurisdiction. These \nrights  might  include  data  portability,  findability,  and  accessibility  – legal  provisions  that  give  \nindividuals  rights  over  use  of  data  about  them  – and  may  need  to  be  extended  to  include  rights  \naround community data or co-generated data. If data trusts are to operate effectively, these rights \nalso need to be managed in a way that allows the trustee to act on behalf of the trust’s members, \nraising legal questions about how to delegate or mandate rights to a trust.  \n● Data  sharing  policies:  A  range  of  different  legal  agreements  and  frameworks  play  a  role  in  \nsupporting the data sharing ecosystem in which data trusts operate. Some of these are explored in \nthe  interim  report,  including  data  standards,  data  formats,  sector-specific  policy  frameworks  and  \nother data sharing agreements. The ability of data trusts to facilitate data use will depend in part on \nthe effectiveness of this wider environment.   \n● Fiduciary obligations: Definitions of fiduciary responsibilities vary across countries. Under common \nlaw, fiduciary duties can be used to create safeguards around data trusts –   they would require data \ntrustees to act in the best interests of the trust’s members, and are associated with high levels of \naccountability and loyalty for those trustees. In other jurisdictions, different strategies will be needed \nto implement such requirements, ensuring data trusts remain trustworthy. Such actions may include \nregulation, opportunities for judicial intervention, or other policy action. \nRecent years have already seen attempts by governments to develop policy or regulatory frameworks that \ncan facilitate the development of data intermediaries. While the framework presented in the Aapti Institute’s \nreport is still in development, policymakers can look to these building blocks as a framework for assessing \ndata trust-readiness. Important questions to consider in the next phase of developing the policy environment \nwill include: \n● Are existing data rights sufficient?  \n● What types of data sharing infrastructure are needed to underpin data trusts? \n● Do existing legal frameworks provide sufficient safeguards to ensure data trusts remain trustworthy? \n \n \n\n7 \n \nNext steps \nTogether, these interim reviews show both the progress that has been made in advancing data trust research \nand practice over the last five years, and the progress that is needed to operationalise the vision behind data \ntrusts. They raise interesting questions at the interface of data trust research and practice, including: \n● What support do practitioners need to operationalise real-world data trusts? What new operational \nstrategies can help deliver all the core functions of data trusts? \n● In  what  areas  are  there  significant,  unrealised  opportunities  for  creating  data  trusts  that  benefit  \npeople and society? \n● What data rights and data sharing infrastructures must be in place to enable data trusts to operate? \nWhere legal interventions are not available, what alternative strategies can work in their place? \n● What  interventions  can  help  ensure  that  data  trusts  remain  trustworthy?  As  our  understanding  of  \ncore  concepts  – like  fiduciary  responsibilities,  co-generated  rights  and  collective  interests  around  \ndata use –   evolves, what changes to legal or operational frameworks might be needed?  \nPart of the appeal of data trusts as a stewardship model is their flexibility –   their ability to adapt to local needs \nand opportunities. The diversity of working practices and policy approaches explored in the interim reports \nthat GPAI is publishing today in collaboration with the Aapti Institute and ODI offer opportunities for taking \nstock of what the data trusts community has learned so far, and how it might continue to develop in future.  \nThese reports are the first outputs from GPAI’s data trusts workstrand. In the coming months, we’ll continue \nto work with the Aapti Institute and the Open Data Institute to refine their findings and identify the lessons \nthat can inform future practice and policy development. We hope they can start a conversation with the data \ntrusts community –   if you’d like to provide feedback on the reports, please get in touch via info@ceimia.org. \nIf successful, data trusts could fill an important gap in the data stewardship landscape. By providing a space \nfor meaningful community engagement and participation, they could help connect our aspirations for data \nsharing for social good with the imperative to avoid the harms associated with untrustworthy data use. We \nlook forward to hearing your views about what we can learn from experiences of creating data trusts so far, \nand how the community might develop in future.  \n \n \n \n\n8 \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOutput 1: Data trusts global survey \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nProduced by: \n \n \n \n \n \nIn collaboration with: \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n\n9 \n \nTable of Content \n \nExecutive Summary ................................................................................................................ 11 \nThe emergence of data trusts ................................................................................................ 12 \n1.1.

Who shares data, for what purposes and \nunder what conditions will therefore shape the development of AI and the challenges it is put to.  \nHowever, many organisations currently regard data as something to hoard, causing it to be inaccessible to \nthose who could otherwise use it to create new products or insights. At the same time, a lack of involvement \nof individuals and communities in shaping how data is used will deny beneficial uses of data, due to \npeople withdrawing their consent -  in the broad sense - f  or its collection and sharing. \nIn response, data stewardship has emerged as a responsible, rights-preserving and participatory concept. \nIt  aims  to  unlock  the  economic  and  societal  value  of  data,  while  upholding  the  rights  of  individuals  and  \ncommunities to participate in decisions relating to its collection, management and use. \nIn this context, this research set out to understand global knowledge, attitudes and practices of data \ntrusts. It  was  undertaken  for  the  Global  Partnership  on  AI  (GPAI)  by  Aapti  and  the  Open  Data  Institute  \nbetween  August  and  October  2021,  using  a  combination  of  literature  review,  survey  and  case  studies.  It  \nadopted the GPAI’s Data Governance Working Group interpretation of data trusts as: \n \n“a form of data stewardship that supports data producers to pool their data (or data rights) with the \naim  of  collectively  negotiating  terms  of  use  with  potential  data  users,  through  the  oversight  by  \nindependent  trustees,  with  fiduciary  duties,  and  within  a  framework  of  technical,  legal  and  policy  \ninterventions that facilitate data use and provide strong safeguards against mis-use”. \n \nThe project’s literature review (Section 2) found significant theory, interest and experimentation around new \nforms  of  ‘bottom-up’  data  stewardship  that  seek  to  empower  people  to  participate  in  the  process  of  data  \ncollection, use and sharing. The analysis frames data trusts as a particular, evolving form of bottom-up data \nstewardship. It found emerging consensus on distinctive features of data trusts and that practitioners deploy \na variety of operational strategies to realise its functions. \nA survey (Section 3) was completed by 45 people building or running data trusts and similar bottom-up data \nstewardship initiatives, or who are working on data stewardship and related topics. Analysis of the survey \n(summarised in Section 5) found that: \n● today’s data stewardship projects deliver many of the functions associated with data trusts, \nbut delivering all the functions attributed to a data trust, as per the GPAI Data Governance Working \nGroup’s interpretation, remains a challenge \n● there  is  general  optimism  about  the  potential  of  data  trusts  among  people  working  on  data  \nstewardship. \n● the interest in data trusts as a form of data stewardship seems to be concentrated in Europe and \nNorth America. \n● There are a number of real-world initiatives that demonstrate multiple routes to realising bottom-up \ndata stewardship that do not follow the data-trust definition or deliver all of the functions associated \nwith data trusts. \n● The purpose for bottom-up data stewardship can differ significantly, from supporting altruism \nto generating commercial return and this defines how models design their governance mechanisms. \nThe  case  studies  (Section  4)  document  three  bottom-up  data  stewardship  initiatives:  Driver’s  Seat,  Open  \nHumans and MIDATA. They represent real-world examples of how groups can be empowered around \ndata they’ve generated and are actively making available data for broad societal benefit. \nThe intent is for this report to act as a reference point on the subject of data trusts for practitioners seeking \ninspiration, as well as policymakers, funders and other enabling actors considering how to support the field. \n\n12 \n \n \nThe emergence of data trusts\n \n● This section presents a review of literature on data stewardship and the evolution of the \nconcept of data trusts, discussing the work of Sylvie Delacroix and Neil Lawrence, Sean \nMcDonald and other scholars, and organisations such as the Mozilla Data Futures Lab and \nthe Ada Lovelace Institute. \n● The review documents significant theory, interest and experimentation around new forms \nof ‘bottom-up’ data stewardship that seek to empower people to participate in the process \nof data collection, use and sharing. \n● The review frames data trusts as a particular, evolving form of bottom-up data stewardship, \nand found rapid proliferation around the use of the term among practitioners and scholars \nof stewardship.   \n● While  there  is  divergent  opinion  from  around  the  world  on  how  data  trusts  could  be  \nconstructed,  the  stewardship  community  is  nevertheless  working  to  consolidate  their  \nunderstanding of the term. \n1.1. Data stewardship \nThe effective collection, use and sharing of data can help address the pressing challenges of our time -  from \nsurfacing remedies for climate change\n2\n to improving public health\n3\n. \nThe transformative power of data is best explained through the lens of examples such as the Human Genome \nProject, undertaken between 1990 and 2003.\n4\n Led by the US Government’s National Institute of Health, the \nProject made available data on DNA sequencing within 24 hours of its discovery. The consequent availability \nof  that  data  for  research  and  development  has  not  only  saved  lives,  but  also  generated  $796  billion  in  \neconomic  impact  and  supported  over  300,000  jobs  in  2010  alone.\n5\n  More recently,  the  same  data  sharing  \nnorms  established  by  the  Human  Genome  Project  (the  ‘Bermuda  principle’”)\n6\n  were  adopted  in  the  \ndevelopment  of  vaccines  against  SARS-COV-2.\n7\n  A  lab  in  China  released  the  genome  sequence  of  the  \ncoronavirus  in  January  2020,  which  was  subsequently  used  by  researchers  around  the  world  to  develop  \nantidotes, even without access to physical genomic samples of the virus.  \nH\nowever, despite the positive benefits of data, the emergence of new approaches to its collection, use and \nsharing -   particularly  driven  by  developments  in  machine  learning\n8\n  -    is  underpinned  by  two  disconcerting  \ntrends.  \n                                                      \n2 Szasz, Open Data Institute (2020), “Tackling Climate Challenges through Data Access: Microsoft and the ODI”, https://theodi.org/article/tackling-climate-change-\nchallenges-through-data-access-microsoft-and-the-odi/  \n3 Harper, International Journal of Infectious Diseases (2016), “Sharing Public Health Data Saves Lives”, https://www.ijidonline.com/article/S1201-9712(16)31285-1/fulltext  \n4 See https://www.genome.gov/human-genome-project/What  \n5 Tripp and Greuber, Batelle Memorial Institute (2011), “Economic Impact of the Human Genome Project”, https://www.battelle.org/docs/default-source/misc/battelle-\n2011-misc-economic-impact-human-genome-project.pdf?sfvrsn=6  \n6 See https://dukespace.lib.duke.edu/dspace/handle/10161/7407  \n7 First and Collins, Forbes (2021), “NIH Director Dr. Francis Collins: Connecting The Dots From The Human Genome Project To The COVID-19 Vaccine”, \nhttps://www.forbes.com/sites/billfrist/2021/01/20/nih-director-dr-francis-collins-connecting-the-dots-from-the-human-genome-project-to-the-covid-19-\nvaccine/?sh=738447175438 [Podcast] \n8 Expert Panel, Forbes Technology Council (2019), “15 Social Challenges AI Could Help Solve”, https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2019/09/03/15-social-\nchallenges-ai   -could-help-solve/?sh=76e9dd973533  \n\n13 \n \nFirst, the market-driven imperatives of corporations have helped create digital enclosures\n9\n that hampers the \nability to use data for broad-based social benefit. Much of the current data economy is defined by a paradigm \nof  extraction\n10\n,  whereby  the  role  of  individuals  and  communities  as  the  generators  of  data  goes  \nunrecognised.\n11\n  This  process  of  has  been  described  varingly  as  the  “attention  economy”,\n12\n  “surveillance \ncapitalism”\n13\n and “computational capitalism”\n14\n, with corporations’ use of data existing beyond the control of \nthose individuals and communities.\n15\n For instance, patients signing-up to digital health applications have little \nknowledge  of  who  has  access  to  their  data  and  how  it  will  be  used,\n16\n  just  as  rideshare  drivers  in  the  gig  \neconomy are excluded from the management of algorithms that govern their work.\n17\n \nSecond, a lack of consideration of ethics and equity, and a lack of engagement with those affected by data’s \nuse, undermines trust in the process of data sharing. In the UK, the Government came under scrutiny for its \nGP Data for Planning and Research (GPDPR) proposal, which would facilitate access to the health records \nof 55 million people.\n18\n The proposal has been indefinitely postponed, having been subject to criticism for not \ngiving patients a meaningful say in how the system should work.\n19\n Equally, high profile data breaches such \nas the 2017 Equifax data breach, where an unauthorized third party gained access to data on as many as \n143 million Americans, serve to erode the trust we have as consumers in the processing of data about us.\n20\n  \nThese  trends  have  given  rise  to  inter-related  phenomena  - ‘data  hoarding’  and  ‘data  fearing’\n21\n.  ‘ Data \nhoarding’ relates to a scenario where organisations restrict access to data due to misperceptions about its \nvalue to their operations or the risks associated with data sharing. The benefits of data collection and use \nwould only be enjoyed by a few, while the negative impacts of its use would affect society as a whole.\n22\n On \nthe other end is the scenario of ‘data fearing’, where data might not be collected or used to the extent it could, \ndue to concerns about the harm that it can cause people being left unaddressed. People might avoid using \nservices, or withdraw consent for data to be collected, which means that we end up missing data and the \nuses of it that could support human flourishing. \nThe concept of data stewardship is a response to these ‘data hoarding’ and ‘data fearing’ scenarios. Data \nstewardship  can  be  understood  as  an  approach  to  data  governance  that  is  responsible,  rights-preserving \nand  participatory  in  nature\n23\n.  In  effect,  data  stewardship  aims  to  unlock  the  societal  value  of  data,  while  \nupholding the data rights of individuals and communities to participate in decisions relating to its collection, \nmanagement and use.\n24\n  \n \n \n                                                      \n9 Andrejevic (2009), Amsterdam Law Forum, “Privacy, Exploitation and the Digital Enclosure”, \nhttps://www.researchgate.net/publication/228226821_Privacy_Exploitation_and_the_Digital_Enclosure  \n10 Morozov, E., (n.d.), Council of Europe, “Digital Intermediation of Everything: At the Intersection of Politics, Technology and Finance”, https://rm.coe.int/digital-\nintermediation-of-everything-at-the-intersection-of-politics-t/168075baba  \n11 Manohar, Kapoor and Ramesh (2020), Aapti Institute, “Data Stewardship: A Taxonomy”, https://thedataeconomylab.com/2020/06/24/data-stewardship-a-taxonomy/  \n12 Beuno (2017), London: Rowman and Littlefield International, “The Attention Economy: Labour, Time and Power in Cognitive Capitalism” \n13 Zuboff (2018), New York: PublicAffairs, “The Age of Surveillance Capitalism: The Fight for  Human Future at the New Frontier of Power” \n14 Beller (2018), London: Pluto Press, “The Message is Murder: Substrates of computational capital” \n15 Lawrence (2016), The Guardian, “Data trusts could allay our privacy fears”, https://www.theguardian.com/media-network/2016/jun/03/data-trusts-privacy-fears-\nfeudalism-democracy  \n16 Sur (2021), Medianama, “Online medical platforms are playing fast and loose, collecting patient data”, https://www.medianama.com/2021/09/223-india-digital-health-\nmedical-platforms-data-consent-records/  \n17 O’Connor (2016), Financial Times, “When your boss is an algorithm”, https://www.ft.com/content/88fdc58e-754f-11e6-b60a-de4532d5ea35  \n18 Vallence (2021), BBC News, “GP Data Sharing: What is it and can I opt out?”, https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-57555013  \n19 Crouch (2021), Digital Health, “GP Data September implementation data is scrapped”, https://www.digitalhealth.net/2021/07/gpdpr-september-implementation-date-\nscrapped/  \n20 Forbes (2017), “Equifax Data Breach Impacts 143 Million Americans”, https://www.forbes.com/sites/leemathews/2017/09/07/equifax-data-breach-impacts-143-\nmillion-americans/#6f6ed8d3356f  \n21 Open Data Institute (2021), “What are data institutions and why are they important?”, https://theodi.org/article/what-are-data-institutions-and-why-are-they-important/   \n22 Newman (n.d.), Federal Trade Commission, “How Big Tech enables harms to consumers, especially to low-income and other vulnerable sectors of the population”, \nhttps://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/public_comments/2014/08/00015-92370.pdf  \n23 Ada Lovelace Institute (2021), “Disambiguating data stewardship”, https://www.adalovelaceinstitute.org/blog/disambiguating-data-stewardship/  \n24 Manohar  (2019),  Aapti  Institute,  “Responsible  data  sharing  for  public  good:  Theoretical  bases  and  policy  tools”,  https://thedataeconomylab.com/2020/07/31/data-\nsharing-for-public-good-theoretical-bases-and-policy-tools/  \n\n14 \n \n1.2. Bottom-up data stewardship \nCorporations, governments and civil society organisations find themselves occupying powerful positions in \ndetermining how data is put to use. However, within most current mechanisms for data collection, use and \nsharing, the involvement of individuals and communities is non-existent. \nIn response, a more empowering paradigm of ‘bottom-up data stewardship’ has emerged. It builds on the \nideals of data stewardship, recognising individuals and communities as more than recipients of information - \nor  mere  providers  of  consent  -   about  how  data  about  them  is  used\n25\n,  and  seeks  to  empower  them  to  \nparticipate in the process of data collection, use and sharing.  \nA\nn ecosystem of research and practice has emerged around this concept of ‘bottom-up data stewardship’. \nThe MyData Global community, for example, is set out “to empower individuals by improving their right to \nself-determination regarding their personal data”\n26\n. The Mozilla Data Futures Lab was launched in 2021 to \nsupport experimentation around “new approaches to data stewardship that give greater control and agency \nto people”\n27\n. The Ada Lovelace Institute advocates for ‘participatory data stewardship’, where people whose \ndata is used or about which data decisions are taken are meaningfully involved.\n28\n Aapti Institute’s work at \nthe  Data  Economy  Lab\n29\n  aims  to  empower  individuals  and  communities  to  play  a  bigger  part  in  data  \ngovernance, and it has documented numerous examples of this in practice.\n30\n \nR\nesearch suggests that the bottom-up data stewardship initiatives emerging from this  ecosystem can be \nfunctionally  very  different,  especially  in  terms  of  the  types  of  involvement  they  afford  to  individuals  and  \ncommunities\n31\n.  Some  initiatives  - such  as  Bitsabout.me\n32\n  - enable  people  to  make  granular,  individual  \ndecisions about who has access to data about them, for what purposes and in exchange for what;\n33\n other \ninitiatives -  such  as  Salus.coop\n34\n  and  others  described  below  - enable  people  to  participate  in  collective  \ndecision-making as part of a community;\n35\n and a few initiatives -  such as Jumbo\n36\n -   enable people to delegate \nanother  party  to  mediate  data  collection  and  use.\n37\n  Research  on  bottom-up  data  stewardship  has  also  \ndemonstrated  the  array  of  other  ways  such  initiatives  can  differ.\n38\n    Aapti’s  Stewardship  Mapper\n39\n,  which  \ndraws on interviews and analysis of 100+ bottom-up data stewardship initiatives, describes nine categories \nof ‘design choices’ practitioners can make in constituting them, from business models to technical features. \nI\nn particular, a number of promising initiatives have emerged to enable groups to generate or repurpose data \nabout them, and exert collective control over it for a common purpose. For instance: \n● Variant Bio\n40\n works with historically marginalised populations to facilitate people-driven therapeutics. \nCommunities  are  engaged  prior  to  the  beginning  of  research  projects;  their  data  is  then  collected  \nand used within a framework that focalises community concerns. \n                                                      \n25 Ada Lovelace Institute (2021),”Participatory data stewardship: A framework for involving people in the use of data”, \nhttps://www.adalovelaceinstitute.org/report/participatory-data-stewardship/  \n26 MyData (n.d.).

Consequently, the ways in which data is processed by \ncorporations and governments affect not only the organisation of information, but also people’s \naccess to services and ultimately, their autonomy itself. \nScholars such as Linnet Taylor\n51\n have draw attention to the “structural dicrimination” inherent to \nintensifying  datafication,  such  that  institutions  of  the  state  (through  population  databases  and  \nsurveillance)  and  corporations  (as  dominant  entities  with  accumulated  data  and  processing  \nabilities)  function  to  amplify  exclusion  and  disempowerment  of  individuals  and  communities.  \nElsewhere, Lina Dencik and Anne Kaun\n52\n illustrate the debilitating impact of datafication on the \nwelfare state, leaving citizens with limited bargaining power and agency to control the use of their \ndata.  \nI\nn such a milieu, reconstituting the conventional agenda of social justice becomes crucial to forge \nethical pathways to regulate datafication. Data justice is an expression of this impulse, making \n“fairness  in  the  way  people  are  made  visible,  represented  and  treated  as  a  result  of  their  \nproduction  of  digital  data”  as  crucial  considerations  that  should  guide  policy  and  regulation  on  \ndata.  \n1.3. Data trusts: an evolving conceptual framework \nThe  concept  of  ‘data  trusts’  has  evolved  from  this  backdrop  of  bottom-up  data  stewardship.  The  idea  of  \nextracting  value  from  data  and  restructuring  its  distribution  through  the  use  of  data  trusts  was  posited  by  \nProfessor Neil Lawrence in 2016,\n53\n whereby data trusts could act as “power brokers” to mediate the use of \ndata for public benefit, without compromising the rights of data subjects to whom the data relates.  \nS\nubsequently, Delacroix and Lawrence articulated ‘bottom-up data trusts’ in 2019\n54\n as a tool of collective \nengagement  used  by  communities  to  decide  on  how  their  data  is  used  and  shared  by  third  parties.  They  \ndescribed  how  trustees  could  be  bound  by  fiduciary  obligations  of  undivided  loyalty  and  care  towards  its  \nbeneficiaries, defining the terms for purpose-led data sharing. It set out use cases to outline the advantages \nof the approach in different contexts. For example, in the context of social media and financial information, \ndata trusts could have a role to play in negotiating terms on behalf of data subjects to ensure data could be \nmade available for research and public policy purposes. \nT\nhe  Data  Trusts  Initiative  builds  on  this  conception  of  data  trusts.  It  describes  them  as  a  “mechanism  for  \nindividuals  to  pool  their  data  rights  into  an  organisation”\n55\n,  with  i)  independent  stewardship  of  the  pooled  \nrights, ii) fiduciary responsibilities, iii) operations guided by a framework of institutional safeguards and iv) \nthe  facilitating  of  collective  action.\n56\n    This  conception  of  the  data  trust  seeks  to  rebalance  the  respective \ncontrol  that  corporations  and  individuals  have  over  personal  data,  and  provide  a  legal  mechanism  to  \nempower data subjects to choose to appoint others to make those decisions on their behalf.

Their work \ndescribes  the  potential  for  data  trusts  in  consumer  protection  and  fiduciary  governance  for  the  data  \neconomy.\n61\n  It  argues  that  the  data  trust,  a  legal  arrangement  where  a  trustee  is  appointed  with  fiduciary  \nobligations towards a specified beneficiary, is suited to creating predictable data supply chains with increased \naccountability. \nA\ns a model of bottom-up data stewardship, data trusts represent a compelling instrument to unlock data for \npublic benefit uses within a framework of fiduciary duties, such that data sharing decisions are compliant with \nthe interests and rights of communities.\n62\n As the Global Partnership for AI has itself described, they offer the \npotential to “expand access to data for innovation while putting citizen interests at the heart of stewardship”.\n63\n  \n1.4. Differing interpretations of data trusts  \nThere has been a lack of consistent, global interpretation of data trusts among scholars, policymakers and \nother actors, reflecting the nascent nature of the research and practice of bottom-up data stewardship. \nIndia’s proposed framework for the governance of non-personal data recommends the appointment of data \ntrustees as representatives to steward community data and channel its use for socially beneficial purposes \nsuch  as  entrepreneurship,  innovation,  research  and  policymaking.\n64\n  Similarly,  Ontario  state  authorities  in  \nCanada are exploring legal mechanisms to establish data trusts that would enable ‘privacy-protective data \nsharing’.\n65\n \nThe  European  Commission’s  proposed  Data  Governance  Act,  2020  outlines  a  framework  for  “data  \nintermediaries” -  entities which provide “data sharing services” that “contribute to the efficient pooling of data \nas well as to the facilitation of bilateral data sharing”.\n66\n   Although the Act does not explicitly identify a specific \ncategory or type of data intermediary, scholars have put forth data trusts as possible mechanisms to promote \nenfranchisement and meaningful realisation of data rights of subjects within the EU.\n67\n \n                                                      \n57 Ruhaak (2019), Mozilla Foundation, “Data trusts: Why, what and how”, https://medium.com/@anoukruhaak/data-trusts-why-what-and-how-a8b53b53d34  \n58  Manohar (2019), Aapti Institute, “Trust Law, Fiduciaries and Data Trusts”, https://thedataeconomylab.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/DataTrustsPpr_SM.pdf  \n59 Certain scholars have demonstrated that data lacks the requisite quality to be considered and treated as “property” in law.

Using this interpretation, the ODI undertook pilot projects to generate insights on the potential \napplication of data trusts in the contexts of food waste management, wildlife poaching and urban mobility.\n69\n \nIt  has  also  observed  UK  Biobank,  OpenCorporates  and  Oversight  Board  as  examples  of  independent,  \nfiduciary stewardship of data applied in practice\n70\n. \nThis interpretation is adopted elsewhere. Based in the US, PLACE describes itself as a data trust for creating, \nstoring and accessing mapping data, governed by independent trustees drawn from different geographies \nand sectors\n71\n. Johns Hopkins Medicine has similarly been described as having ‘a data trust administrator’, \nresponsible for  retaining    patient  privacy  while  enabling  medical  records  to  be  used  to  improve  care  and  \nfacilitate research\n72\n. Toronto’s experience with a proposal to set up a ‘civic data trust’ is another example \nthat worked to this interpretation.\n73\n In 2019, Sidewalk Labs proposed setting up a civic data trust to govern \ndata generated by sensors and cameras around the neighbourhood that would be developed. Ultimately, the \nproject was abandoned in 2020 citing unprecedented economic uncertainty but perhaps mostly due to local \nopposition to the development plans. \nT\nhis research works to a definition based on the Global Partnership for AI’s consensus statement, whereby \na data trust is “a form of data stewardship that supports data producers to pool their data (or data rights) with \nthe aim of collectively negotiating terms of use with potential data users, through the oversight by independent \ntrustees, with fiduciary duties, and within a framework of technical, legal and policy interventions that facilitate \ndata use and provide strong safeguards against mis-use”. This interpretation is aligned with the concept as \nput forward by Lawrence and Delacroix in their paper on ‘bottom-up data trusts’ and as adopted by the Data \nTrusts Initiative. It marries the conception of groups of individuals coming together to contribute data within \nthe framework of independent fiduciaries duties. \n1.5. Institutionalising data trusts and codifying fiduciary responsibilities \nThere has been significant discussion around the challenge of institutionalising the data (or data rights) to be \nheld and managed by data trusts, and codifying the fiduciary responsibilities of trustees. \nEstablishing data trusts involves the pooling of data, or data rights, and the exertion of control over these \ndata  (rights)  by  a  trustee.  Data  rights  enshrined  within  legislation  are  therefore  a  prerequisite  for  their  \ndevelopment.\n74\n Over the past decade, we have seen the introduction of significant new data protection laws \nglobally that represent the basis of a data rights framework. Jurisdictions in Canada have implemented data \nprotection legislations at the federal\n75\n and provincial levels,\n76\n with Ghana close behind in enacting its Data \nProtection Act, 2012.\n77\n The most significant step towards articulation of data rights is the EU’s General Data \nProtection Regulation, 2016\n78\n which sought to impose controls on data processing, rooted in principles of \nindividual harm, rights and privacy. This has spurred a flurry of personal data protection regulations that have \n                                                      \n68  Hall and Pesenti (2017), “Growing the Artificial Intelligence Industry in the UK”, \nhttps://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/652097/Growing_the_artificial_intelligence_industry_in_the_UK.pdf  \n69 Open Data Institute (2019), “Data trusts: lessons from three pilots”,  https://theodi.org/article/odi-data-trusts-report/   \n70 Hardinges (2020), The Open Data Institute, “Data trusts in 2020” https://theodi.org/article/data-trusts-in-2020/  \n71 Verhulst et al (n.d.), PLACE, “Establishing a data trust: From concept to Reality”, https://www.thisisplace.org/blog-1/introducingplace/establishing-a-data-trust  \n72 Dell Technologies (2019), “Lessons from a user-trusted data trust”,  https://www.delltechnologies.com/en-us/perspectives/lessons-from-a-user-trusted-data-trust/  \n73 Tusikov (2019), Centre for Free Expression, ““Urban Data” and “Civic Data Trusts” in Smart Cities”, https://cfe.ryerson.ca/blog/2019/08/%E2%80%9Curban-\ndata%E2%80%9D-%E2%80%9Ccivic-data-trusts%E2%80%9D-smart-city  \n74  Data Trusts Initiative (2021), “Data trusts: international perspectives on the development of data institutions”, \nhttps://static1.squarespace.com/static/5e3b09f0b754a35dcb4111ce/t/603ce3325e1da817afe6b193/1614603061204/WP+2+-+DTI+-+global+perspectives.pdf  \n75 The Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act, 2004 \n76 To date, Alberta, British Columbia and Quebec have provincial laws to govern processing of personal information. Additionally, Ontario, Newfoundland and \nLabrador, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick have enacted independent legislations on health information processing.  \n77 The Data Protection Act, 2012 (Act 843) \n78 Regulation (EU) 2016/679 - General Data Protection Regulation \n\n19 \n \nbeen introduced or implemented in multiple jurisdictions outside Europe, such as India,\n79\n Kenya,\n80\n Brazil,\n81\n \nSouth Africa,\n82\namong others. \nHowever,  despite  alignment  between  some  regions,  there  remain  significant  variations    in  the  data  rights  \nafforded by different jurisdictions. In addition to these variances, it is important to note that the manner in \nwhich  specific  rights  - such  as  the  right  to  data  portability,  which  is  crucial  to  support  bottom-up  data  \nstewardship -  are enforced differ across legal regimes. Further complications arise for jurisdictions that do \nnot have an operative data protection legislation and consequently, provide little clarity on the data rights of \ncitizens.\n83\n Therefore, the feasibility of data trusts will be a function of the extent and nature of data rights \nafforded by the relevant legal jurisdiction, and the way those rights are enforced. This dynamic is explored \nfurther in legal research undertaken by Aapti in parallel to the research described by this report. \nEnabling data sharing for social benefit through data trusts: Legal review \nIn addition to the present research, Aapti was commissioned by GPAI to examine the existing and \nnecessary legal mechanisms required to develop data trusts. To do so, the researchers undertook \na rigorous process of comparative legal analysis across 11 jurisdictions to draw out variations in \ndata protection laws and rights, data sharing frameworks and fiduciary obligations -  all of which \nconstitute essential legislative underpinnings of a data trust.  \nThe resultant comparative analysis throws up several key insights that demonstrate disparity in \nmaturity  of  legal  landscapes  for  data  trusts  around  the  globe,  and  point  to  the  need  for  \nadministrative and legislative investments in data governance in several countries. Further, it was \nfound  that  for  legal  systems  which  do  not  embed  fiduciary  duties  matching  common  law  \nstructures,  there  may  be  a  need  to  explore  diverse  structures  for  enabling  human-centric  data  \ngovernance. Key takeaways from this research have been summarised below: \n● Disparity across nations and lack of digital infrastructure: Given the diversity -  both \neconomic  and  political  - of  the  jurisdictions  analysed,  it  was  found  that  the  maturity  in  \narticulating  rights  over  data  varied  significantly.  This  includes  regulatory  measures  like  \nstandardisation of data formats or sharing purpose, enabling interoperability, or introducing \ndigital public infrastructure.  \n● Personal data rights and building for autonomy: Even within some of the countries with \nmore robust digital infrastructures, the absence  of certain personal data rights -  such as \naccess,  portability  and  erasure  -   pose  challenges  in  creating  a  sustainable  data  trust  \necosystem. For instance, Canada, Australia, and South Korea, while faring well on digital \ninfrastructure, have yet to recognise clear data portability rights.  \n● Legislative  implementation  and  regulatory  oversight:  Legal  concepts  which  may  be  \ncommon  across  jurisdictions  are  not  always  implemented  uniformly.  For  instance,  the  \nextent of adoption of trusts in Kenya and South Africa -  countries with common law origins \n-  is not as crystalised as compared to jurisdictions such as England, which extensively use \ntrusts for a variety of commercial and non-commercial purposes.  \n● A ‘data trust conundrum’ for stewardship: It is evident that the conception of data trusts \nis  most  fundamentally  rooted  in  English  trust  law.  Based  on  this  analysis,  even  in  \njurisdictions  that  have  common  law  influence  and  recognise  trusts,  the  evolution  of  its  \nconcepts have not mirrored the English experience.  \n \n                                                      \n79 The Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019 \n80 The Data Protection Act, 2019 \n81  Lei Geral de Proteção de Dados, 2019 \n82 Protection of Personal Information Act, 2013 (came into force, partly, in 2020) \n83 For more information on the status of data protection and privacy legislations across the world, refer to the UNCTAD’s remarkable tracker available at https://unctad.org/page/data-\nprotection-and-privacy-legislation-worldwide  \n\n20 \n \nIn the past, the role of fiduciaries in the context of data stewardship has generally been limited to ensuring \ncompliance -  that is determining whether grounds for processing of data are in accordance with applicable \nregulations.\n84\n However, this conception of ‘trustees’ holding broader and more explicit fiduciary duties that \ncompel  them  to  act  in  the  best  interests  of  data  producers  has  started  to  be  discussed  within  the  data  \ngovernance ecosystem. This renewed approach to the duties of “trustees” has its roots in the stewardship of \ncommon  pool  resources,  such  as  Scotland’s  ports  trusts.\n85\n  With  myriad  activities  - from  fisheries  \nmanagement  to  renewable  energy  generation  -   being  undertaken,  the  ports  are  managed  through  a  trust  \nframework  set  through  an  act  of  law  of  the  Parliament.  These  trust  ports  are  governed  by  a  stakeholder-\nrepresentative board comprising users of the port, members of the local community, government agencies \nand follows a democratic model of decision-making. The trust framework helps balance various perspectives \nand interests while generating valuable income for regional and national economies; at the heart of the trust \nport model is the fiduciary duty of loyalty and care which mandates trustees to act in the best interest of its \nstakeholders.\n86\n \nSean McDonald\n87\n has expanded on the application of explicit, contextual fiduciary duties to the governance \nof data, describing data trusts as a tool to hold companies accountable for their decisions and the promises \nmade to users. In this view, data trusts offer a credible legal container for articulating fiduciary accountability \nand establishing processes to enable the right of redress.  \nT\nhe  concept  of  information  fiduciaries\n88\n  proposed  by  Balkin  also  provides  a  seminal  analysis  of  fiduciary  \nduties. It has, however, been subject to criticism,\n89\n chiefly in that the approach fails to take cognisance of the \nentrenched  business  models  that  drive  diverging  interests  between  end  users  and  data  processors.  \nAccording to this criticism, users are not adequately equipped by platforms and data processors in order to \nexpress  and  act  on  their  interests,  which  is  not  changed  by  the  imposition  of  fiduciary  duties  on  data  \nprocessors. Also, as fiduciary obligations are normally settled by courts, the cost of solving each dispute on \nviolation of fiduciary obligations may prove to be too much for users as well as the legal system to bear.\n90\n \nDivergent  views  have  also  been  expressed  as  to  the  legal  forms  most  suitable  for  data  trusts  to  take  to  \n‘house’ the data (rights) contributed by data subjects, and to codify the fiduciary responsibilities of its trustees. \nIn the UK, the ODI worked with a legal consortium on its initial pilots who argued that the mechanism of trust \nlaw was ‘inappropriate’ for constructing data trusts, largely on the basis that data cannot be made the property \nof  a  trust  under  existing  law\n91\n.  This  statement  was  subsequently  challenged  by  the  legal  community.  In  \nOctober  2019,  Professor  Ben  McFarlane  of  University  of  Oxford  questioned  this  finding,  suggesting  that  \npeople’s rights over data, such as those conferred by the General Data Protection Regulation, rather than \ndata itself, could be made the property of a legal trust and asserted collectively by its trustees.\n92\n A similar \nargument has been made by Sylvie Delacroix and Neil Lawrence, who have suggested that while there are \nchallenges, they ‘do not constitute reasons to doubt that data rights can be held under a legal Trust’. A paper \npublished in the National University of Singapore Faculty of Law’s journal similarly found that ‘the traditional \ntrust, the historical creation of English Equity jurisprudence and now found around the world, is a perfectly \nsensible vehicle for the management of data’.\n93\n \n                                                      \n84 Bailey and Goyal (2019), Data Governance Network, “Fiduciary relationships as a means to protect privacy: Examining the use of the fiduciary concept in the draft \nPersonal Data Protection Bill, 2018”, https://datagovernance.org/files/research/NIPFP_Rishab_Trishee_fiduciaries_-_Paper_4.pdf  \n85 Transport Scotland (n.d.).

For example, Germany does not have a trust law framework, but nonetheless has \ninstitutional forms such as the Sparkassen (cooperative or not-for-profit banks) that carry fiduciary obligations \nascribed to the common law trust. And in Quebec, a civil law jurisdiction, the Quebec trust enables data rights \nto  be  pooled  and  administered  by  a  trustee,  which  has  sparked  widespread  excitement  around  the  \nopportunity.\n94\n These examples indicate the difference in legal structures being experimented with in different \nlegal jurisdictions in order to facilitate the development of data trusts.\n \n  \n                                                      \n94 Hulin (2021), Data Trusts Initiative, “How can civil law jurisdictions support data trusts?

International  knowledge,  attitudes  and  practices  of  data  \ntrusts \n● This  section  describes  the  results  of  a  survey  to  understand  knowledge  (awareness  and  \nunderstanding), attitudes (perspective) and practices (implementation) of data trusts around \nthe world. \n● Respondents  included  those  operating  data  trusts  or  similar  bottom-up  data  stewardship \ninitiatives, and organisations working on the topic of data stewardship. \n● The survey: surfaced awareness of and optimism towards the concept of data trusts; found \ngeneral agreement with the definition put forward by GPAI; found no projects delivering all the \nfunctions of real-world data trusts through one vehicle but a number of similar bottom-up data \nstewardship initiatives that were delivering many of the functions; and encountered a variety \nof legal forms and technologies used to construct the different initiatives.  \n \n2.1. Context \nThis  section  describes  the  results  of  a  survey  undertaken  to  understand  the  knowledge  about,  attitudes  \ntowards and practices of data trusts from around the world.  \nThe survey was divided into four sections. The first covered basic information about the respondent: their \ncountry of work, role and organisation name. The second sought their current understanding of data trusts, \nand included questions about the definition of data trusts and other forms of data stewardship. The survey \nthen split into two parts, with one for completion by practitioners (people building or running data trusts, or \nsimilar bottom-up data stewardship initiatives) and the other for experts working on data stewardship and \nrelated topics. Practitioners were asked questions about how their initiatives work and whether they identified \nthemselves as data trusts. Experts were asked about their perceptions of the current state of data trusts, and \ntheir thoughts about the future of the movement. In general, the survey combined structured and open-ended \nquestions designed to enable quantitative analysis as well as space for respondents to elaborate their ideas. \nThe survey was initially distributed by Aapti and ODI to around 100 practitioners and experts. It was also \ndisseminated  through  social  media  platforms  and  newsletters,  the  GPAI  Working  Group,  and  snowballed  \nthrough respondents sharing the survey themselves. At the close of the survey there were 45 responses. \nThere was an even split between practitioners and experts, 22 and 23 respectively. Responses were heavily-\nweighted towards Europe (and in particular from the UK), with nearly ¾ of all the respondents working there. \nThe sectors that respondents described working from were technology and data, health and research. \n \n \n\n23 \n \n2.2. Awareness and understanding \nThe concept of data stewardship was a familiar topic for the respondents of the survey, as you might expect \nfrom practitioners and experts. Respondents were slightly less familiar with the idea of data trusts. \n \n \nFigure 1: Respondents familiarity with data stewardship and data trusts \n \nBeyond data trusts, our respondents were aware of a variety of other forms of data stewardship -  the most \nfamiliar  being  data  trusts,  data  commons,  and  data  exchanges.  The  familiarity  with  data  trusts  was  \nunsurprising  given  the  focus  of  this  project.  Respondents  also  shared  examples  of  data  stewardship  that  \nwere not listed as prompts, such as statistics agencies and national bodies. \nAs  the  literature  review  details,  there  are  varying  interpretations  of  data  trusts.  In  this  case,  82%  of  \nrespondents agreed with the GPAI definition of data trusts as “a form of data stewardship that allow data \nproducers to pool their data (or data rights) and facilitate collective negotiation of terms of use with potential \ndata  users,  working  through  independent  trustees  who  are  bound  by  strong  fiduciary  duties,  within  a  \nframework of technical, legal and policy interventions that facilitate data use and provide strong safeguards \nagainst mis-use”. The respondents who did not agree with the definition offered a variety of interesting ideas \nand opinions. \nA  number  of  respondents  disagreed  with  the  language  used  in  the  GPAI  definition.  In  one  case,  the  \nrespondent felt that the who the trustees have a fiduciary duty to was missing, preferring the language of \ntrustees “acting on behalf of the data subjects”. The respondent also described the need for data trusts to be \nworking  towards  a  specific  purpose  and  felt  this  should  be  reflected  in  the  definition.  Other  respondents \nquestioned the use of the term “data producer” and requested that the legal mechanism intended to create \nthe fiduciary duties should be documented.  \nA further contention made by respondents was whether the definition reflected a feasible reality. In particular, \nrespondents questioned whether the imposition of fiduciary duties and technical, legal and policy safeguards \nwas an ideal, and too high a bar to be met. One respondent preferred to talk about ‘data intermediaries’ and \nanother described there not to be a need for an independent trustee. These responses perhaps represent \nsomething deeper than varying ideas for the definition of data trusts, and instead reflecting the existence and \nneed for various forms of bottom-up data stewardship. \n  \n\n24 \n \nWhen asked to list examples of data trusts, respondents responded in three ways: \n● They gave examples of similar bottom-up data stewardship initiatives (the difference between these \nand data trusts is discussed below).  \n● They gave theoretical examples of data trusts. \n●    They stated that they were not aware of any practical examples of data trusts. \nA number of examples given by respondents -  including Swash\n95\n and MIDATA\n96\n -   did not appear to have all \nof  the  functions  of  a  data  trust  set  out  by  the  GPAI  definition.  In  particular,  none  appeared  to  have  \nindependent trustees with fiduciary responsibilities. Other examples were not yet active, like the Liverpool \nCivic Data Cooperative\n97\n. Other examples were theoretical or abstract, such as ‘a Health Bank’, a theoretical \ndata trust of residents of a housing block and mentions of the examples put forward by Sylvie Delacroix and \nNeil Lawrence’s paper\n98\n.   \n2.3. Practices \nTo find out about the practices of data trusts, part of the survey was targeted specifically to practitioners who \nare building or running data trusts. \nThese questions focused on understanding how each initiative identified itself, their function and purpose, \nand included practical questions on their approach to data stewardship. There were 22 respondents to this \npart of the survey.  \nIn terms of identifying their initiatives, around a third of practitioners did not identify as data trusts. Within \nthese  respondents,  we  observed  two  main  types  of  organisations.  The  first  consist  of  organisations  like  \nSchluss & digi.me, who see themselves as the creators of infrastructure onto which data trusts can be built - \nfor example by creating the technology for users to collect their data in a pod or vault. The second was formed \nof  organisations  with  similar  aims  to  the  concept  of  data  trusts,  as  put  forward  by  GPAI,  but  function  \ndifferently.  For  example,  Swash  described  having  “built-in  trustless  structures”  rather  than  fiduciary  \nresponsibilities to achieve the outcome of empowering people with their data, and CSIRO detailed how they \nwork to enable the aggregation of data for the common good but unlike data trusts, participating actors control \nwhat happens to the data rather than trustees. \nThe survey asked practitioners to select which of the 6 functions, as per the GPAI definition of data trusts, \ntheir initiatives undertake, as follows: \n1.   Provide a platform for people to pool data. \n2.   Provide a platform for people to establish desirable terms and conditions of data use. \n3.   Negotiate  use  of  the  data  in  accordance  with  agreed  terms  and  conditions,  facilitating  safe  and  \ncontrolled data use. \n4.   Appoint expert trustees to take responsibility for the stewardship of the data. \n5.   Create a regime of strong fiduciary responsibilities to bind the trustees to act in the interests of the \ndata trust’s members. \n                                                      \n95 Swash, (2021).

(2019, October 1). Bottom-up data Trusts: disturbing the ‘one size fits all’ approach to data governance. International Data Privacy Law. \nRetrieved October 26, 2021, from https://academic.oup.com/idpl/article/9/4/236/5579842.  \n\n25 \n \n6.   Establish safeguards and oversight mechanisms to prevent data misuse and to take remedial action \nin the event of the trust’s terms and conditions being breached. \nOn average, the respondents stated that they had between four and five of the functions, with responses \nranging from just one to the full six. \n \n \nFigure 2: “Which of the following functions does your initiatives have?” - question to data stewardship practitioners. \n \nThere was a relatively even distribution across five of the six roles, with one function outlying: Appoint expert \ntrustees to take responsibility for the stewardship of the data. This may reflect that the requirement to appoint \nexpert trustees to oversee the stewardship of data may be one of the more difficult functions to achieve in \npractice. Conversely, providing a platform to pool data, and establishing safeguards over that data, appear \nsome of the more common and achievable functions in practice.  \nSeven respondents said their initiatives had all six of these functions, appearing to determine them as data \ntrusts.  However,  of  these  seven:  the  name  of  one  of  these  was  not  given  (N/A);  two  were  not  yet  active  \n(PLACE, Donate your Data Foundation); two instead develop technology for data trusts (Sightline Innovation, \nPolyPoly); and one preferred not to define as a data trust (DataYogi). This left one for us to examine further \n(Worker Info Exchange). \nWorker Info Exchange is a non profit organisation dedicated to helping workers access and gain insight from \ndata collected from them at work.\n99\n The project is relatively early stage, but is active and currently stewards \ndata on behalf of gig workers. On their website, there is clear evidence they are providing a platform to pool \ndata  and  establish  desirable  terms,  they  are  negotiating  safe  usage  of  their  users  data,  and  establishing  \nsafeguards  to  prevent  data  misuse.  However,  it  is  unclear  as  to  whether  there  are  any  data  trustees  and  \nwhether those trustees have fiduciary responsibilities to act in the best interests of their members. The lack \nof evidence means that for the purposes of this report, Worker Info Exchange is not considered a data trust. \n                                                      \n99 Worker Info Exchange, (2021). Retrieved from: https://www.workerinfoexchange.org/  \n\n26 \n \nDespite not meeting the GPAI definition, Worker Info Exchange is an excellent example of bottom-up data \nstewardship in practice\n100\n. \nThe survey also asked experts about the frequency that they had seen the six functions of data trusts in their \nwork.  \n \n \nFigure 3: “In the data stewardship initiatives you have come across in your work, please select the frequency that you \nsee the following features” - question to data stewardship experts. \n \nTwo thirds of the experts had frequently seen initiatives providing a platform for individuals and groups to \npool their data. The other 5 functions were rarely observed in a practical setting.  \nThe  survey  explored  how  bottom-up  data  stewardship  initiatives  function,  asking  respondents  to  describe  \nlegal forms, technical systems and business models. \nData  trusts  have  been  conceptualised  as  being  constructed  using  trust  or  common  law,  but  only  one  \nrespondent specified that they had given thought to this (they had undertaken some research to understand \nhow trust law could be applied in their context). Respondents described a wide range of legal approaches \nused to underpin their initiatives. Limited companies, foundations and nonprofits were the most frequent legal \nforms, with constructs such as cooperatives also mentioned. A number of respondents alluded to the fact \nthat different legal forms were suitable in different circumstances. \nAs well as the legal form of their initiative, respondents also commented on the wider legal conditions around \nthem.  Respondents  cited  the  General  Data  Protection  Regulation  as  a  legislation  or  law  that  has  been  \n‘specifically helpful or harmful to your initiative’. Other similar laws, such as the CDPR in California and the \n“Law for a digital republic in France” were also mentioned. \n                                                      \n100 This project reached out to Worker Info Exchange to respond to this analysis, Worker Info Exchange agreed with our description of the initiative not currently meeting the GPAI definition, \nbut described how the team was currently exploring whether becoming a data trust of this nature was a feasible undertaking. \n\n27 \n \nThe  technologies  adopted  by  the  respondents  were  also  varied.  Some  organisations  described  using  \nblockchain, while the development of ‘pods’ or ‘vaults’ for personal data were also described. Blockchain was \ndescribed  as  being  useful  by  initiatives  working  towards  creating  a  ‘trustless’  structure,  in  which  the  \ndistributed technology was seen as replacing the need for trustees to make decisions. The ‘pods’ and ‘vaults’ \nwere  described  by  initiatives  seeking  to  help  users  to  have  more  control  over  data  about  them  on  an  \nindividual, rather than group, basis. There was also discussion of privacy enhancing technologies to ensure \nthe safety of users' data, as well as Application Programming Interfaces to facilitate access to the data being \nbrought together by the initiatives. \nRespondents also shared information about their business models. Most of the respondents described being \nfunded by non-earned revenue streams, such as philanthropic funding, public funding or private investment. \nThe predominance of unearned revenue reflects the relative infancy of bottom-up data stewardship initiatives \nand finding them early in their quest for sustainability\n101\n. A quarter of respondents described earned revenue \nstreams, including membership fees for the users of the initiative, selling access to data to third parties and \nanalysing and packaging the data into insights.  \nI\nn terms of the scale and maturity of the initiatives, 50% of the respondents had 1,000 members or less, and \n80% of the initiatives are less than 5 years old (or are yet to be operational).  \n2.4. Attitudes towards data trusts \nThe survey also sought to understand the respondents’ attitudes and perspectives on data trusts. \nA number of survey respondents, both experts and practitioners, were positive about the potential of data \ntrusts. By increasing the control people have over data about them, a number of respondents thought that \ndata trusts could help to rebalance the power asymmetry in the data economy. One respondent stated that \nthrough data trusts, people’s data could be better safeguarded from private interests, avoiding ‘abusive data \nrelationships’.  Respondents  felt  data  trusts  could  also  work  towards  a  future  where  there  was  increased  \naccess to and usage of data for public benefit. They described how data trusts could be designed to tackle \n“problems in which individuals are interested in combining their data to get a broader analysis of a specific \nchallenge, or where individuals benefit from pooling their data”. \nSome respondents described the lack of practical examples of data trusts holding the concept back. There \nwas a strong desire, verging on impatience, among some of the experts to see an operational data trust, \neven to the point where some described that the concept had become ‘somewhat of a fantasy’. Others were \nconcerned that the focus on an approach to bottom-up data stewardship that only exists as a concept may \ndetract from other similar -  but importantly, operational -  approaches (such as those featured as case studies \nin this report). Some respondents were also concerned about the potential uptake of data trusts as and when \nthey  became  functional,  feeling  that  the  demand  for  them  originates  largely  from  experts  and  reaching  a  \ncritical  mass  of  users  would  require  a  dramatic  shift  in  culture,  understanding  and  skills  across  the  data  \neconomy. \n \n \n \n \n                                                      \n101 Dodds, L., Szász, D., Keller, J., Snaith, B. and Duarte, S.

Case studies \n● This section consists of three case studies of bottom-up data stewardship initiatives: Driver’s \nSeat, Open Humans and MIDATA. \n● They represent real-world examples of how groups can be empowered around data they’ve \ngenerated, and are actively making available data for broad societal benefit. \n● They  have  been  selected  on  the  basis  of  their  community-centrism  and  maturity,  and  the  \nstudies unpack the purposes for their formation, their stakeholders served, their legal structure, \ntheir internal data governance principles and the technical safeguards used to mediate access \nto data. \n3.1. Criteria and selection \nThis section of the report consists of three case studies of bottom-up data stewardship initiatives. They are \nintended to shed light on the practical considerations involved in designing such an initiative, and to surface \nperspectives from practitioners operating them. \nThe  case  studies  rely  on  secondary  research  in  the  form  of  Aapti  and  the  ODI’s  internal  interview  notes,  \nanalysis and videos. The cases were selected using the two criteria: \n1. Maturity -   There are many interesting proposals and theoretical models for data  trusts and bottom-\nup data stewardship initiatives. However, for the purposes of the case studies, we skewed towards \nthose that are operational (i.e. actively supporting data to ‘flow’ between actors). \n2.   Community-centrism -    Empowering people to exercise meaningful control over data takes many \nforms. We have chosen cases that adopt a collective, participatory approach to data stewardship, \nsuch that their members dictate how their data is used, by whom and for what purposes. \nIdeally, Aapti and the ODI would have liked to feature initiatives that responded to the survey as case studies. \nHowever, the researchers found that Driver’s Seat,  Open Humans and MIDATA\n not just satisfy the above \nmentioned  criteria  more  so  than  respondents,  but  are  perhaps  some  of  the  most  promising  examples  of  \nbottom-up data stewardship in general. \nAs well as showing the variety of design choices available, the case studies, albeit anecdotal, highlight the \nvirtues of bottom-up stewardship. \n\n29 \n \n \nFigure 4: Snapshot of insights from case studies (Source: Aapti/ODI analysis) \n3.2 Driver’s Seat \nOverview \nDriver’s Seat enables workers in the gig economy to gain control over their data and access analytics that \nhelp them earn more from their labour. \nFounded in 2019 in Colorado, USA, the platform was developed over conversations with Uber and Lyft drivers \nwhose work was mediated by the ‘extraction, processing and delivering of data’ via algorithms that tended to \ndeny workers of their agency and a voice in negotiating their working conditions.\n102\n Driver’s Seat also aids in \nthe monetisation of driver’s mobility data by selling access to public authorities and local governments that \nuse  these  insights  in  policy  making  and  resource  allocation.\n103\n  Consequently,  the  entity  unlocks  societal  \nvalue by directing data use towards public benefit, while simultaneously compensating the members of its \ncooperative for their role in generating this data.  \n \n                                                      \n102 Witt, Hays [Aapti Institute] (2021). “Data Economy Lab | Tracking Stewardship: Driver’s Seat - Empowering gig workers through data” [Video].

Additionally,  the  platform  presents  opportunities  for  monetisation  of  aggregated  \nmobility data and its insights by selling it to public transportation agencies.\n104\n This information provides crucial \ninputs for policy making in areas such as pollution control and congestion management. In fact, municipal \nauthorities  are  afforded  visibility  into  rideshare  operational  patterns  and  analytics  that  are  otherwise  \nchallenging to access or comprehend.  \nStructure \nDriver’s  Seat  is  registered  as  a  for-profit,  limited  cooperative  association  in  Colorado,  USA.  The  primary  \nbeneficiaries of this platform are rideshare and delivery workers who have signed up to become members of \nthe cooperative. It adopts a delegated cooperative structure that is governed by a representative board, with \nat least 51% of the board members drawn from the larger community of workers.\n105\n This structure is quite \nunlike  MIDATA,  considered  below,  which  instead  adopts  a  ‘one  member,  one  vote’,  approach  to  internal  \ngovernance.  \nR\nideshare  and  delivery  workers  who  are  a  part  of  Driver’s  Seat  share  data  with  the  application,  which  \nfunctions as a data storage and analytics platform. Insights and visualisations created on the platform not \nonly enhance the agency of gig workers by placing data in their control, but also provide crucial information \nthat  enables  them  to  optimise  for  higher  wages  and  better  working  conditions.  Moreover,  Driver’s  Seat \nenables this data to be shared with local government transit operators, promising to improve the reach and \neffectiveness of citizen service delivery and experience.\n106\n \nMembership fee, grant money and private investments are the intended funding streams for Driver’s Seat. \nHowever, monetisation of insights and aggregated data sold to public authorities is currently its sole source \nof revenue.\n107\n \n \n                                                      \n104 Dickey (2020),TechCrunch, “Coop helps Uber, Lyft drivers to use data to maximise earnings”, https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/06/co-op-helps-uber-lyft-drivers-use-data-to-maximize-\nearnings/  \n105 Stewardship Navigator (2021), Aapti Institute, https://thedataeconomylab.com/ (pending publication) \n106 Ibid.  \n107 Ibid. \n\n31 \n \nStakeholders \nThe primary stakeholders served by Driver’s Seat are gig workers: rideshare and delivery drivers employed \nby Uber, Lyft, DoorDash, Uber Eats, Amazon Flex and Postmates operating within the US. These workers \nalso constitute the data generators whose mobility information and personal data is managed by the platform. \nData users include local government and transportation agencies that use analytics and aggregated mobility \ndata supplied by Driver’s Seat as a part of urban policy and planning.\n108\n \nThe representative board governing the cooperative is the designated decision-making body that authorises \nall data sharing and selling activities. \nGovernance principles \nThe  data  stewarded  by  Driver’s  Seat  includes  members’  personal  data  as  well  as  anonymised  mobility  \ninformation. The data rights are vested in the cooperative board, with individual members retaining only the \nright to revoke consent for data use. \nSignificantly, data sharing and selling decisions are authorised through the cooperative board in which gig \nworkers  hold  at  least  51%  representation  and  voting  rights.  Further,  the  members  are  also  entitled  to  a  \nminimum  51%  of  the  share  of  profits  generated  by  Driver’s  Seat.  The  twin  features  of  representation  and  \nshare in profits are mandated by the Colorado Uniform Limited Cooperative Association Act, 2012.\n109\n  \nMembers of the cooperative participate in data decisions by electing representatives to the board. Individual \nconsent for data access, processing and sharing is obtained at the point of on-boarding to the Driver’s Seat \napplication. Lastly, members can revoke consent for any of these functions and request deletion of their data \nvia email.\n110\n \nPrivacy controls \nDriver’s Seat anonymises the data contributed by drivers and shares only aggregated datasets and insights \nwith  its  data  users  once  approved  by  the  board.\n111\n  Personalised  analytics  and  visualisation  derived  from  \nindividual members’ data is not shared with third parties. \nAnalysis \nMonetisation of aggregated data and insights by Driver’s Seat performs two functions -  one, it contributes to \nthe income of gig workers who are profit-participants in the entity and two, creates a viable source of revenue \nthat contributes to the financial sustainability of Driver’s Seat. Delegated representation afforded through the \nentity’s  cooperative  board  upholds  participation  of  data  generators  in  decision-making  as  a  core  of  its \noperating principles.  \nThe experience of Driver’s Seat holds interesting insights for data trusts and data trust-like initiatives that \nhope to facilitate effective purpose-driven data sharing. Additionally, the social value element can be fulfilled \nby identifying appropriate stakeholders, in this case public transit agencies, who stand to benefit from the \nuse  of  the  data  stewarded  by  the  initiative.  Delegated  representation  and  decision-making  through  the  \ncooperative board could potentially reduce the burden on beneficiaries to evaluate granular considerations \non data sharing, while simultaneously availing valuable advisory services from the board. \n \n \n                                                      \n108  Witt,  Hays  [Aapti  Institute]  (2021).  “Data  Economy  Lab  |  Tracking  Stewardship:  Driver’s  Seat  - Empowering  gig  workers  through  data”  [Video].

Open Humans \nOverview \nOpen Humans is a not-for-profit that allows individuals and communities to donate personal data for use in \nresearch, education and health projects. \nEstablished  in  2015  in  the  US,  the  platform  helps  individuals  access  and  understand  their  personal  data  \nthrough an Open Humans account and donate it for projects that align with their values or goals. The entity \nfacilitates public benefit data sharing while providing granular and dynamic controls, creating opportunities \nfor bottom-up decision-making and data governance. \nOpen  Humans  differs  from  Driver’s  Seat  on  two  fronts:  Open  Humans  supports  granular  decision-making \nfunctions by allowing each member to approve or disapprove use of their data in a specific project, and the \nincentive to participate is altruistic as the entity does not stand to make any profits or generate revenue from \nits sharing activities. \n \n \n Figure 6: Structure of Open Humans (Source: Open Humans website)  \nPurpose  \nOpen Humans is designed to empower individuals and communities around their personal information, by \ncombining technology and community governance of data to advance an open, participant-centric approach \nto human subjects research.\n112\n It has built a platform for collaboration between communities and researchers, \ndirecting  data  to  projects  or  purposes  that  fulfill  the  data  donors'  personal  expectations.  The  entity  also  \nfacilitates citizen science and subject participation in health research. Open Humans currently has 12,364 \nmembers.\n113\n  \n  \n                                                      \n112 Ball, Mad [Aapti Institute] (2021). “Data Economy Lab | Tracking stewardship: Open Humans - Empowering citizens, patients and researchers through data” \n[Video]. Youtube. https://youtu.be/L9GHP-u0gK4  \n113 As on 20 September, 2021, reported on the organisation’s website.  \n\n33 \n \nStructure \nOpen  Humans  is  registered  as  a  501(c)(3)  nonprofit  organization  in  the  US\n114\n.  In  addition  to  providing  a  \nplatform for collaboration and data sharing, Open Humans allows individuals to run analytics on their personal \ndata and understand it through free and open source “notebooks” that can be embedded in one’s browser. \n115\n  The  entity  is  funded  through  grants  from  Robert  Wood  Johnson  Foundation,  Knight  Foundation  and  \nShuttleworth Foundation.\n116\n  \nStakeholders \nIndividuals who have signed up as members of the Open Humans community are the data producers, while \nacademic  institutions,  citizen  scientists  and  researchers  comprise  the  data  requestors  and  users.  Data  \nsharing decisions are made by individuals who can agree to sharing their personal data, particularly health \ndata, for a specific project. Therefore, consent is specific to a project and can be revoked at any point.\n117\n \nGovernance principles \nThe members of Open Humans are the primary decision-makers. They retain full control over their personal \ndata  and  authorise  its  use  through  granular  controls  on  a  project-to -project  basis.\n118\n  Individuals  and  \ncommunities willing to donate their data for research are encouraged to examine the purpose and value of a \nparticular project before agreeing to share their data.  \nS\nimilarly,  any  member  of  Open  Humans  - irrespective  of  their  academic  background  -   can  create  \nprojects/research studies about a specific theme. This is best demonstrated through the many citizen science \nprojects hosted on the platform.\n119\n All projects undergo a community review process, performing a role akin \nto the ethics or internal review board within academia. The review is an open and public process in which \nevery member can participate. Communities can de-platform a project as a part of the review process.\n120\n  \nPrivacy controls \nData may or may not be anonymised or pseudonymised before it is shared; it is dependent on the nature of \nresearch involved.\n121\n Member data is centrally stored on the Open Humans platform and a copy in shareable \nformats is made available to third parties who have been authorized to access the data.\n122\n Analytics, insights \nand visualisation accessed by individuals through personalised “notebooks” and such tools hosted on the \nplatform are not shared with third parties, unless otherwise consented to by an individual.  \nAnalysis  \nOpen  Humans  presents  a  unique  use  case  of  a  bottom-up  data  steward  that  is  explicitly  concerned  with  \nfacilitating data sharing for social benefit. Individuals and communities are invited to become a part of the \nentity and participate actively in research projects that appeal to them personally, exploring themes that are \notherwise  often  marginalised within  conventional  academic  discourse.  For  instance,  a  project  on  the  \ndynamics and perceptions of the neovagina is currently being hosted on the Open Humans platform. It allows \nmembers to deliberate on the research methodology and frame questions that should be addressed as a \npart  of  this  study.  In  essence,  the  platform  embeds  health  research  within  a  strong  framework  of  citizen-\ndriven science and community interests.  \n                                                      \n114 Open Humans Foundation (n.d.).

MIDATA \nOverview \nMIDATA is a member-owned cooperative that provides an open source technical platform for account holders \nto store their personal data and share it with researchers and service providers. \nDeveloped by ETH Zurich and Bern University of Applied Sciences, MIDATA Switzerland was established in \n2015  and  the  entity  supports  the creation  of  other  regional  or  national  cooperatives  that  use  MIDATA’s  \ntechnical infrastructure.\n123\n MIDATA account holders can control who has access to their data and direct its \nuse in specific clinical studies. \n \n \nFigure 7: Structure of MIDATA (Source: MidData website) \n \nPurpose \nThe  cooperative  was  established  to  fulfill  two  objectives:  to  enable  citizens  to  gain  control  over  health  \ninformation and to amass valuable aggregated health data for use in medical research.\n124\n MIDATA allows \nindividuals to engage with health research projects and determine if they wish to contribute their data to a \ncertain study. Thus, it facilitates active participation of data subjects in medical research.\n125\n \nStructure \nMIDATA  is  a  non-profit  cooperative,  registered  under  Article  828  of  the  Swiss  Code  of  Obligations.\n126\n  It’s \nprimary   function   includes   the   development,   deployment   and   maintenance   of   a   common   technical   \ninfrastructure  that  allows  MIDATA  data  account  holders  and  members  to  store  their  personal  data.  \n                                                      \n123 Ibid.  \n124 Ibid. \n125 MIDATA (2021). Retrieved from https://www.MIDATA.coop/en/partners/  \n126 Corporate law of Switzerland is primarily contained within the Swiss Code of Obligations, from Article 552 to 1186. Cooperatives such as MIDATA are governed as \nper provisions under Article 828 to 926.  \n\n35 \n \nSignificantly, members of the cooperative govern the use of data through a system of rights vested within \nArticle 4 of MIDATA’s Articles of Association.\n127\n \nMembers  of  the  cooperative  are  required  to  pay  a  one-time  fee  of  CHF  40  to  cover  administration  and  \noperational  costs  incurred  for  managing  the  cooperative.\n128\n  Private  investments,  including  grant  money,  \nseem to constitute its primary source of funding.  \nStakeholders \nIndividuals who hold an account on the MIDATA platform and members of the MIDATA cooperative are the \nprimary data producers in this context. The nature of data stored and managed through the MIDATA platform \nis primarily personal data, including sensitive health information such as genomic data and medical records. \nThey consent to share their data on a per-project basis with pharmaceutical companies, research institutions \nand other interested third parties that make up the category of data requestors.\n129\n  \nGovernance principles \nData  sharing  decisions  undergo  two  levels  of  review  and  authorisation.  First,  every  proposal  containing  a  \nrequest for data is reviewed by MIDATA’s Data Ethics Review Board.\n130\n The board may choose to admit a \nproposal, depending on the nature and purpose of research involved. Creating value for MIDATA’s members \nand  data  account  holders  whilst  contributing  to  society’s  knowledge  on  a  particular  health  condition  is  a  \ncrucial consideration in the process of review. Second, the proposal that has been vetted by the Board is \nthen sent to the general assembly of members for further authorisation. The general assembly follows a ‘one \nmember, one vote’ model typical of cooperatives and a simple majority vote is necessary to gain approval \nfor a proposed project.\n131\n \n \n \nFigure 8: Governance mechanism of MIDATA (Source: MIDATA website) \nIndividual members and data account holders on the platform may consent to independently and exclusively \nshare their personal data (or a specific subset therein) with other account holders, the cooperative itself or \nthird parties requesting data.\n132\n Consent collection is digitally-mediated and obtained through the MIDATA \n                                                      \n127 The original MIDATA Article of Association, published in German, can be accessed here - https://www.MIDATA.coop/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/08/MIDATA_Statuten_20190626.pdf ; an unofficial English translation is also available on the website, viewable on \nhttps://www.MIDATA.coop/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/MIDATA_Statuten_20190626_EN.pdf  \n128 MIDATA (2021).

Data producers (i.e. individuals) reserve the right to revoke consent for data use through the process \nof research and beyond.\n133\n \nPrivacy controls  \nAll data on the MIDATA platform is stored centrally on servers in Switzerland and follow multi-level encryption \nand ‘a perfect forward secrecy protocol’.\n134\n Individual data may or may not be anonymised or pseudonymised \nprior to sharing, varying on the proposal under consideration and the nature of data required to undertake \nresearch. Third party data requestors are granted access to granular datasets of individuals who consent to \nsharing data for a specific project, after obtaining necessary authorisation for the project from the Data Ethics \nReview Board and the general assembly. \n135\n \nAnalysis  \nMIDATA is founded on traditional cooperative principles that have been transposed onto the current data-\ndriven world. It creates an environment for cooperative members to pool their data and use it in pursuit of \ntheir  collective  desires.  Sophisticated  standards  for  health  data  interoperability  followed  by  MIDATA  \ncombined with a direct democracy approach to data sharing help achieve transparency and utomost technical \nsafeguards  for  responsible  bottom-up stewardship.  Authorisation  layers  in  the  nature  of  MIDATA’s  Data  \nEthics  Review  Board  help  ensure  compliance  with  community  interests  and  that  the  members  of  the  \ncooperative are involved at every step of the data value chain. Lastly, the not-for-profit nature of MIDATA \navoids  any  conflict  of  interests  that  may  arise  when  financial  imperatives  are  posed  against  public  good  \nsolutions.\n136\n \n3.5 Insights from case studies \nThe  experiences  of  Driver’s  Seat,  Open  Humans  and  MIDATA  chronicled  in  this  section  surface  valuable \nreference points on the subject of data trusts and data trust-like initiatives. Although there exists significant \ndifferences in their structure -  MIDATA and Driver’s Seat are data cooperatives while Open Humans is a non-\nprofit -   the  three  use-cases nonetheless  deliberately  focalise  community  empowerment  as  the  underlying  \npurpose of their initiatives. \nBy  examining  real-world  case  studies,  the  research  demonstrates  the  multiplicity  of  avenues  and  design  \nchoices  that  are  available  to  builders  of  data  trusts  and  data  trust-like  initiatives  to  actualise  bottom-up \nmechanisms  for  stewardship.  Further,  it  illustrates  how  initiatives  managing  the  use  of  data  can  embed  \nparticipation  of  data  generators  as  a  cornerstone  of  their  governance  principles.  This  marks  a  crucial  \ndeparture  from  the  current  disempowering  paradigm  of  data  sharing  that  is  opaque,\n137\n  extractive\n138\n  and \nmarginalises the role of individuals and communities in data decisions.\n139\n  \nT\nhese case studies highlight the virtues of bottom-up stewardship. Data sharing decisions within the use-\ncases considered go hand-in -hand with respect for agential rights of individuals and creation of social benefit \nthrough the use of data. Responsible data stewardship makes available data for social benefit in ways that \nare  democratic  and  privacy-preserving,  while  balancing  complex  considerations  of  market  incentives  and  \npublic  welfare.\n140\n  Thus,  upcoming  data  trusts  and  data  trust-like  initiatives  should  embody  participatory  \n                                                      \n133 Ibid.  \n134 Ibid. \n135 Ibid. \n136 Kapoor, Aapti Institute (2021), “Rethinking data monetisation”, https://thedataeconomylab.com/2021/06/14/rethinking-data-monetisation/  \n137 Engler, Brookings (2021), “Tech cannot be governed without access to its data”, https://www.brookings.edu/blog/techtank/2020/09/10/tech-cannot-be-governed-\nwithout-access-to-its-data/  \n138 Sadowski, The Reboot (2021), “The Internet of Landlords Makes Renters of Us All”, https://thereboot.com/the-internet-of-landlords-makes-renters-of-us-all/  \n139 Medina, The Conversation (2021), “NHS data gathering: government plans to collect and share health records are hugely concerning – here’s why”, \nhttps://theconversation.com/nhs-data-gathering-government-plans-to-collect-and-share-health-records-are-hugely-concerning-heres-why-162699  \n140 Tenisson, et al., Open Data Institute and Bennett Institute for Public Policy (2020), “The value of data: Policy implications”, \nhttps://www.bennettinstitute.cam.ac.uk/media/uploads/files/Value_of_data_Policy_Implications_Report_26_Feb_ok4noWn.pdf  \n\n37 \n \nmechanisms for stewardship that can engineer effective outcomes for all stakeholders -  communities, private \nentities and the public at large.  \n4. Key findings and takeaways \nThe research generated the following key findings and takeaways on the global state of data trusts: \n1.   While there is emerging consensus around what functions a data trust should deliver, there remain \nquestions about the specific operational strategies which can deliver these functions in practice.\n141\n \nHowever, the research encountered a plurality of bottom-up data stewardship initiatives that enable \ngroups to engage in data sharing for social benefit and embody features that are nonetheless similar \nand attributed to data trusts. \n2. The\nre is general optimism about the potential of data trusts among people working on data \nstewardship. Both practitioner and expert respondents to the survey described a positive outlook \non data trusts as an approach to data stewardship. Indeed, many were eager -  and in some cases \nimpatient -  to see  real-world examples to begin to test the considerable theory behind them. \n3. The interest in data trusts as a form of data stewardship seems to be driven from Europe and \nNorth America. The response to the survey -  with 37 of the 45 respondents based in Europe and \nNorth America -  suggests a relative maturity in terms of imagining new forms of data stewardship. \nThis may be due to the existence of data protection regulations that afford data rights, such as the \nright to access and potability, which are prerequisites to actualise bottom-up initiatives (such as the \nones featured here as case studies).This means the maturity of the data rights landscape needs to \nbe borne in mind while recommended data trusts in different jurisdictions.  \n4. The purpose for bottom-up data stewardship can differ significantly. The examples examined \nin  this  research  are  markedly  different  in  their  purpose,  and  subsequently  their  legal  forms,  \ngovernance  processes  and  business  model.  Initiatives  such  as  MIDATA  and  Open  Humans  are  \ndriven by altruistic motivations for data sharing. On the other hand, initiatives such as Driver’s Seat, \nSwash  and  Digi.me  seek  to  financially  compensate  those  that  have  contributed  data  by  charging  \ninterested parties for access. \n5. There  are  a  number  of  real-world  initiatives  that  demonstrate  multiple  routes  to  realising  \nbottom-up data stewardship. The survey findings and case studies exhibit a diversity of initiatives \nunited in their efforts to empower individuals and communities to steward data. This highlights that \nthere is no ‘one-size-fits-all’ framework for operationalising participatory forms of data stewardship. \n \n \n \n                                                      \n141 Data Governance Working Group (2021), Global Partnership for Artificial Intelligence, “Understanding data trusts”, https://ceimia.org/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2021/07/2021-07-09-GPAI-summary-understanding-data-trusts-updated.docx.pdf  \n\n38 \n \n5. Endnotes \n5.1 About Aapti, ODI, and GPAI \nAapti  Institute is  a  public  research  firm  that  works  at  the  intersection  of  technology  and  society,  building  \npolicy-relevant and actionable insights on the digital economy. It was founded in 2019 in Bangalore, India. \nThrough its Data Economy Lab, a flagship effort to rebalance power in the digital economy, Aapti supports \nresearch, conversation and experimentation around the practice of data stewardship. \nThe Open  Data  Institute works  to  make  data  work  for  everyone  by  working  with  businesses  and  \ngovernments  to  build  an  open,  trustworthy  data  ecosystem.  It  is  independent,  nonprofit  and  nonpartisan,  \nfounded in 2012 by Sir Tim Berners-Lee and Sir Nigel Shadbolt. From its headquarters in London and via its \nglobal network of startups, members and nodes, the ODI offers training, research and strategic advice for \norganisations looking to explore the possibilities of data. \nThe Global  Partnership  on  Artificial  Intelligence  (GPAI)  is  a  multi-stakeholder  initiative  which  aims  to  \nbridge the gap between theory and practice on AI by supporting cutting-edge research and applied activities \non  AI-related  priorities.  Built  around  a  shared  commitment  to  the  OECD  Recommendation  on  Artificial  \nIntelligence, GPAI  brings  together  engaged  minds  and  expertise  from  science,  industry,  civil  society,  \ngovernments, international organisations and academia to foster international cooperation. \n5.2 Authors \nThis report was written by Astha Kapoor & Soujanya Sridharan from Aapti Institute and Jack Hardinges and \nJoe Massey from the Open Data Institute. The report was written in collaboration with the GPAI Data Working \nGroup, whose insight and expertise helped to shape the direction, content and focus of this report. \n5.3 Report drafting \nThis report was written in the autumn of 2021, with the research taking place over the summer. The survey \nwas developed in July and distributed over the month of August which was followed by analysis and drafting \nof the report in September. The first draft of the report was reviewed by GPAI in late September.    \n5.4 Acknowledgements \nWe would like to thank GPAI for giving us the opportunity and funding to conduct this research and write this \nreport, and for supporting the research with their knowledge and passion. We also thank the respondents \nwho gave their time to answer the survey -  their insights form the basis of this report. \n  \n\n39 \n \n6.

This work takes a focussed look at the existing and necessary global \nlegal landscape needed to enable data trusts. It aims to canvas global jurisdictions to assess their legislative \ndata  regimes,  and  provide  a  framework  by  which  to  evaluate  the  feasibility  of  data  trusts  in  selected  \njurisdictions.  In  the  conversation  to  enable  data  sharing  and  governance  mechanisms  that  feed  societal  \nvalue, data trusts have been a focal point, particularly due to the degree of accountability that fiduciary duties \nin common law trusts can enable. To implement data trusts, however, numerous aspects require untangling \n-  one of these is the legal applicability of trust law to the context of data, and related ecosystem-level needs, \nthe focus of this report.  \nBeginning with a literature review that encompasses the bases and evolution of data trusts as a structure for \nhuman-centric  data  governance,  this  report  posits  the  legal  challenges  foreseen  in  transmuting  trusts  for  \ndata. In order to carry out a global legal review, we developed a framework for necessary legal enablers as \nwell as gating criteria for the jurisdictions considered in the analysis. This process and the challenges within \nit have been documented in this report. While the aim has been to encompass common law, civil code, and \nmixed legal systems - marrying them in a composite analysis framework is complex, as trust law and fiduciary \nduties feature most firmly and fundamentally in common law. Beyond the contours of fiduciary obligations, \ndata rights, protection and sharing frameworks were also foregrounded as key enablers for data trusts -  and \neach region has been evaluated upon these. Consequently, all eleven jurisdictions have been measured for \ntheir ‘preparedness’ to enable data trusts, and analysis for each has been detailed as well. While it is helpful \nto  understand  the  data  trust  fertility  across  these  regions,  it  has  been  a  delicate  balance  to  provide  \nassessment  while  allowing  for  subjective  interpretations  of  these  legal  landscapes,  and  the  myriad  \n(sociological, political and economic) nuances embedded in each region. Given this, the framework deploys \na  scale  that  moves  from  ‘poorly  defined’  to  ‘robust’.  It  must  be  noted,  however,  that  each  of  these  data  \nregimes are dynamic and evolving -  implicitly, the analysis holds potential to be built upon and populated \nfurther. In many cases, our analysis has featured not only enacted legislation, but policy directives and other \nindicators of potential legal approaches to data governance.  \nThis  legal  review  has  brought  forth  numerous  insights  - on  parity  across  jurisdictions,  the  need  for  robust  \ndigital infrastructure, and the potential to embed different models of data stewardship, optimised for different \ncontexts. Beyond the scope of legal analysis, challenges in implementing data trusts still remain. Building \ntrust, establishing sustainable and beneficiary-oriented incentive structures, solving for notions of community \ndata rights, and embedding meaningfully participatory governance in data trusts are a few of the questions \nthat have followed from this research. It is hoped that the ecosystem of academics, policymakers, builders \nand  civil  society  actors  will  build  upon  these  questions  and  analyses,  as  data  regimes  and  pathways  to  \nsocietal value crystallise in the coming years.  \n  \n\n50 \n \nINTRODUCTION \nThe  role  of  data  in  solving  for  some  of  the  world's  most  pressing  societal  challenges  -  whether  through  \nhealthcare, climate, mobility or scientific research -  has become increasingly clear. Innovation is increasingly \npredicated in data-driven processes, and the success and conception of most artificial intelligence is defined \ntoo by data access and usability. In the shadow of this potential value, however, is a status quo reflecting \nstark  inequities  within  the  data  economy  - power  is  skewed  toward  large  corporations  and  governments,  \nwhile  individuals  and  communities  retain  little  visibility  or  agency  into  their  datas  journey,  usage  or  \ngovernance.  \nAs countries move to govern their data, regulation has shown a pronounced focus on the individual -  on data \nprotection,  building  robust  consent  frameworks  and  in  some  cases,  instituting  mature  data  rights  like  \naccessibility  or  portability.  As  this  process  unfolds  across  the  globe,  it  is  time  to  begin  unpacking  another  \nimportant goal -  empowering communities and enabling collectivisation to accrue the latent societal value of \ndata. In recent years, scholars and practitioners have explored data trusts as a form of stewardship -  one \nwhich envisions accountable and rights preserving pathways to both agency, and innovation-oriented value. \nWhile data stewardship has seen numerous instantiations, it has equally faced challenges of implementation. \nThere  is  a  need  here,  to  examine  how  legislation  may  best  enable  community  governance,  and  human-\ncentric modes to manage our data.  \nIn particular, data trusts are conceptualised upon existing common law pillars of trust law, and accountability \ninstilled  through  fiduciary  obligations.  While  this  may  present  a  compelling  framework  for  delegated  \nnegotiation, collectivised leverage and responsible, streamlined data sharing -  there are numerous lacunas \nin relying on trust law for data. It is in this context that we undertake an exercise in legal landscaping. The \naim of this research, while nascent and largely unaccompanied by any sibling literature, is to provide a useful \nstarting  point  and  evaluation  to  understand  the  legal  mechanisms  that  can  enable  data  trust  initiatives.  \nFurther, we analyse various global jurisdictions for their preparedness across these mechanisms -  working \nthrough common and civil law systems, Global North and South countries, and countries at various stages \nin  their  data  policy  journeys.  The  breadth  of  this  exercise  has  landed  us  at  various  permutations  and  \ncombinations of preparedness, historical, legal and technical contexts across these regions. Thus, it is hoped \nthat  this  analysis  will  serve  as  early  literature  to  a  growing  body  of  work  - how  can  data  policy  effectively  \nenable trusted intermediaries and social benefit?  \nThe following study adopts a function-first approach -  using the actionable features assumed of a data trust \nto arrive at their corresponding legal pathways. At the outset, we establish the need for data stewardship, \nconfine  the  term  ‘data  trusts’  to  a  single  definition,  and  assess  the  foreseeable  legal  hiccups  in  \nimplementation of the same. The weight of this work has been in its processes and comparative analysis - \nbuilding a working framework for legal analysis by treading from roles of a trust, to functions, and arriving at \nnecessary  legal  enablers.  Beyond  this,  the  selection  of  jurisdictions  for  analysis,  and  the  application  of  a  \nuniform framework to the vast global variety threw up a number of challenges -  all of which we have attempted \nto chronicle in this report. While the analysis itself has yielded valuable insights, it is the authors’ intention for \nthis work to be built upon and multiplied -  as the approaches and upshots of global data regimes steadily \nmake themselves known.  \n  \n\n51 \n \nSECTION 1 \n \nThe report's introductory section traces data trust's theoretical and legal underpinnings, especially \nits reliance on common law trust frameworks. This has been carried out by a literature review, \ndrawing on the works of various academics, practitioners, and organisations. The introduction is \nprefaced by discussions on the existing power imbalances in the data economy and the need to \ndevelop human-centric approaches to data governance.  \nFinally,  building  on  these  discussions,  the  final  part  of  the  section  lays  the  foundations  for  the  \nmethodology  and  framework  by  outlining  the  various  challenges  that  are  foreseen  in  the  \nimplementation  of  data  trusts.  The  key  insights  from  the  discussions  in  this  section  were  as  \nfollows: \n● Given  the  marked  imbalances  in  the  data  economy,  there  is  a  growing  realisation  for  the  \nneed to recognise data stewards that can preserve and advance the rights and interests of \nindividuals. \n● While there are different models of stewardship that can mediate these relationships, relying \non trust law frameworks, data trusts represent a model of stewardship that places fiduciary \nresponsibility at its heart. \n● However, fitting data trusts in existing structures give rise to multiple challenges across legal \nsystems that need to be explored.  \n1.1 The need for human centric approaches to data governance \nIn recent years, the rapid advancement of data-driven innovations and the computational tools that facilitate \nthem  has  led  to  the  development  of  a  vast  data  economy.\n142\n  At  the  core  of  which  lies  the  individual  data  \nsubject; generating both personal data and non-personal community data.\n143\n However, the status quo of this \neconomy  reflects  a  fundamental  power  imbalance  in  the  kinds  of  value  being  derived  from  such  data  \ndrivenness. Value has been directed largely by market-first, profit oriented motives from private corporations, \nlimiting not only the actualisation of data’s societal value, but access to data itself. Consequently, individuals \nand communities are disadvantaged, unable to wield meaningful control over or partake in the governance, \nmanagement  and  usage  of  their  data.  This  asymmetry  is  both  compounded  by  and  symptomatic  of  the  \natomisation  present  in  the  data  economy  today  - a  fragmentation  that  creates  no  digital  conception  of  \ncommunities.  Data  is  relational,  and  shared  lived  experiences  are  often  used  in  tandem  to  facilitate  the  \nweaponization of data. Further, it is now omnipresent in increasingly consequential decisions about users, \nworkers, citizens, environmental and other resources, and the broader public. In many ways, data presents \nthe new tool of exploitation.\n144\n \nT\nhere  has  been a  steady  global  policy  shift  toward  more  privacy-oriented  and  rights  preserving  data  \ngovernance -  one that hopes to rebalance power toward the individual. With the EU’s GDPR acting often as \na median for other nations to build robust data protection, mature data rights like accessibility and portability \nare slowly finding voice. This has been simultaneous (though not necessarily equivalent) with the advent of \ncommunity-oriented  data  intermediaries  - data  stewards.\n145\n  A  data  steward  can  be  defined  as  a  trusted \nintermediary acting on behalf of data subjects or data generators, in their relationship with data requestors. \n                                                      \n142McKinsey Global institute (2011), “Big Data : The next frontier for innovation, competition and productivity “, \nhttps://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/McKinsey/Business%20Functions/McKinsey%20Digital/Our%20Insights/Big%20data%20The%20next%20frontier%20for%20innovati\non/MGI_big_data_exec_summary.pdf  \n143 In the context of this work, however, personal data trusts remain a primary focus.  \n144  Andrejevic (2009), Amsterdam Law Forum, “Privacy, Exploitation and the Digital Enclosure”, \nhttps://www.researchgate.net/publication/228226821_Privacy_Exploitation_and_the_Digital_Enclosure  \n145 Manohar, Kapoor and Ramesh (2020), Aapti Institute, “Data Stewardship: A Taxonomy”, https://thedataeconomylab.com/2020/06/24/data-stewardship-a-taxonomy/  \n\n52 \n \nAs a body that acts in the interest of data subjects, stewards work to enable greater agency, transparency \nand protection for subjects, negotiate with data requesters, and seek avenues for societal benefit from data. \nThus,  the  role  of  a  steward  is  dual:  both  rights  preserving  and  value  generative.  Stepping  beyond  the  \nparadigm of individual protection, stewardship strives to empower and circularise value chains\n146\n -   not only \nfor those who most crucially drive the data economy, but to use data as a leveller for pre-digital vulnerabilities \nin society. However, data is difficult to govern -  its value is defined most critically by how it is used, this value \nis  often  dynamic  over  time,  and  different  data  types  necessitate  different  rights,  needs  and  management.  \nGiven these challenges, data stewardship embodies a diverse set of structures, most of which are problem-\nled, and seek to responsibly solve for sectoral or purpose driven goals. Many of these are currently being \nimplemented in practice, and they are being robustly analysed as they evolve.\n147\n Section 1.2 introduces the \nconcept of trusts as a potential legal framework for data. \n1.2 Data trusts as a legal framework that can be transmuted for data  \nSome  models  for  data  stewardship  draw  from  existing  legal  frameworks  to  implement  various  modes  of  \ncommunity  governance  over  different  data  types.  For  example,  an  increasingly  prevalent  stewardship  \nstructure, data cooperatives map to the traditional cooperative model. Members typically partake in decision \nmaking in a democratic one-member-one-vote structure, pool their resources (in this case data) and work to \nfurther a common societal or other goal. The Driver’s Seat\n148\n cooperative provides platform workers on ride \nsharing platforms with useful analytics on their data, enabling greater transparency and agency over their \ndaily wages -  which are typically informed by this data but not shared with drivers. Once aggregated, these \ninsights are also sold to local governance and transport agencies, the revenue from which is divided amongst \nthe cooperative members.  \nD\nata trusts present another model that relies on an existing legal framework -  based most foundationally in \nthe concept of fiduciary responsibility. This will be elucidated further in this study. While common law trusts \nmost broadly denote a transference or delegation of rights, ownership or some kind of property to a fiduciary \n(trustee), the structure for data trusts has differed across many thinkers and this discourse remains dynamic. \nFor the purpose of this research, data trusts are defined as ‘A form of data stewardship that supports data \nproducers to pool their data (or data rights) to collectively negotiate terms of use with potential data users, \nthrough  the  oversight  by  independent  trustees,  with  fiduciary  duties,  and  within  a  framework  of  technical,  \nlegal and policy interventions that facilitate data use and provide strong safeguards against misuse.’ \n149\n  \nThere are other approaches to data stewardship, such as Data Commons, which are not embedded in law \nbut only in practice. However, the focus on legal perspectives, and particularly on data trusts, is informed by \nthe high levels of accountability that law can provide. In this context, we explore the conception of data trusts \nand how it has evolved -  beginning at the notion of information fiduciaries, and the possibility of heightened \naccountability for data controllers.  \nA fiducial view of data governance \nScholars  like  Balkin\n150\n  and  Tuch\n151\n  identify  an  increasing  dependency  and  vulnerability  toward  big  \ntechnologies as functionally similar to traditional fiduciary relationships that individuals have with doctors and \nlawyers. Fiduciary relationships typically involve some exercise of discretionary power over the interests of \nthe recipient/beneficiary. This power is authorised through consent, unilateral undertaking or legal decree.\n152\n \nTo  address  this  imbalance  between  individuals  and  technology  corporations,  they  rely  on  conventional \nfiduciary  principles  to  propose  recognising  big  technological  corporations  that  depend  on  data-driven \n                                                      \n146 Mc Donald,S (2019), Centre for International Governance Innovation, “ The Fiduciary Supply Chain “, https://www.cigionline.org/articles/fiduciary-supply-chain/  \n147 The Data Economy Lab, Aapti Institute, “Tracking Stewardship”, https://thedataeconomylab.com/tracking-stewardship/  \n148 See https://driversseat.co/  \n149Data Governance Working Group (2021), Global Partnership for Artificial Intelligence, “Understanding data trusts”, https://ceimia.org/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2021/07/2021-07-09-GPAI-summary-understanding-data-trusts-updated.docx.pdf\n \n150 Balkin, Jack M ( 2016), UC Davis Law Review, ,”Information Fiduciaries and the First Amendment”, Available at SSRN: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2675270 \n151 Tuch, Andrew F( 2020), Washington University Law Review 1897 (2021),” A General Defense of Information Fiduciaries”, Available at SSRN: \nhttps://ssrn.com/abstract=3696946  \n152 Miller, P (2014), Oxford University Press, “ The Fiduciary Relationship” \n\n53 \n \nalgorithmic processing as ‘information fiduciaries’.\n153\n Depending on the nature of their relationship with users, \nthese  information  fiduciaries,  Balkin  argues,  ought  to  be  bound  by  fiduciary  duties  to  impose  a  higher  \nstandard of care -  one that ensures the prevention of harm towards consumers.\n154\n  \nBalkin's   classification   of   information   fiduciaries   gathered   support   from   academics,   lawmakers,   and   \ntechnology companies. However, attempts to embed these ideas of trust and fiduciary duty in regulating data \nrights\n155\n, have failed to define obligations that address these imbalances. For instance, the Indian Personal \nData  Protection  Bill’s  conception  of  a  data  fiduciary -   which  is  the  GDPR  equivalent  of  a  data  controller  -  \nexcept when dealing with children’s data, does not require data fiduciaries to make decisions that prioritize \nthe data subjects' interests.  \nH\nowever, scholars like Khan, Pozen, and Grimmelman - while in agreement with the underlying recognition \nof  the  asymmetry  of  information  and  control  - are  critical  of  this  approach.  Khan  and  Pozen  contend  that  \nimposing  a  higher  standard  of  care  on  corporations  -   owing  to  their  divided  loyalties  to  shareholders  and  \nconsumers -   is antithetical to fiduciary law.\n156\n   Grimmelmann further adds to this shortcoming by noting that \ndefining the contours of loyalty for information fiduciaries has its limitations; it either risks being too rigid or \ntoo broad.\n157\n  \nAddressing the concerns posed by Khan et al., Delacroix and Lawrence, rely on the common law conception \nof trusts -envisaging data trusts as a form of bottom-up data governance wherein data subjects pool their \ndata rights for a common purpose.\n158\n Part of the reason why legal trusts have captured current discourse \naround  data  stewardship,  when  thinking  about  accountability,  is  because  of  the  fiduciary  obligations  that  \ntrustees have towards their beneficiaries.  While the exact nature of fiduciary duties vary across jurisdictions, \nat the heart of it, fiduciaries must act with utmost loyalty towards the beneficiaries. The common law notion \nof trust involves the administration of privately owned assets by independent trustees who act on behalf of \nthe beneficiaries identified by the asset owner.\n159\n  \nData trusts propose the appointment of independent trustees -  which owe a fiduciary duty to these subjects \n-   to  make  impartial  decisions  on  the  collectivized  pool  of  rights.  Fiduciary  duty  entails  a  high  level  of  \naccountability, particularly because there is a disparity in power between trustees and beneficiaries. In most \ncases, this also means that courts are enabled to intervene in the functioning and structure of a trust at a \nnormative level, allowing greater oversight to the benefit of subjects. The trustee, therefore, cannot use the \nasset  for  their  own  personal  gain.  These  structures  seek  to  enhance  individual  control  over  personal  \ninformation.\n160\n  \nWhile the conception of data trusts draws from principles of equity and trusts, the use of data trusts so far \nhas been theoretical, and the legal and regulatory frameworks on which data trusts may stand on are yet to \nbe defined. Any policy intervention, therefore, requires a granular identification of the mechanisms that can \ninstantiate data trusts. At the outset of such an exercise, it is important to first identify the existing gaps and \nchallenges in implementing the features of trust law within the context of data. \n \n \n                                                      \n153 Balkin 2016 (n 4) \n154 ibid. \n155US Senator for Hawaii Brian Schatz (2018), “Schatz Leads Group of 15 Senators In Introducing New Bill To Help Protect People’s Personal Data Online” Available at  \nhttps://www.schatz.senate.gov/news/press-releases/schatz-leads-group-of-15-senators-in-introducing-new-bill-to-help-protect-peoples-personal-data-online \n156 Khan L ,and Pozen D (2019), Harvard Law Review, “A Skeptical View of Information Fiduciaries” \n157 Grimmelmann J(2019), Law and Political Economy Blog, “When All You Have is a Fiduciary “ Available at https://lpeproject.org/blog/when-all   -you-have-is-a-fiduciary/ \n158 Delacroix S., and Lawrence N (2019), International Data Privacy Law,  “Disturbing the “ One Size fits All” approach to Data Governance: Bottom -up Data Trusts.”   \n159 Knight v Knight (1840) 49 ER 58 \n160  Mc Donald,S (2019), Centre for International Governance Innovation, “Reclaiming Data Trusts” Available at Reclaiming Data Trusts - Centre for International \nGovernance Innovation (cigionline.org) \n\n54 \n \n1.3  Challenges foreseen in implementation of data trusts  \nIn  order  to  assess  the  possible  implementation  of  data  trusts,  we  have  examined  and  distilled  the  key  \nchallenges  that  are  likely  to  arise,  which  this  section  details.  From  a  legal  perspective,  these  range  from  \nconceptions of fiduciary duty and means for accountability to the subject matter and assignment of data rights \nto  trustees.  Beyond  these,  there  remain  other  challenges  to  implementation  around  sustainability  and  \nincentive structures. While these are pertinent questions, they do not feature in this review, which is limited \nto foundational legal tools that may facilitate data trusts.  \na)   Fiduciary duties  \nCentral to the idea of bottom-up data trusts is the management of the rights of the data holders in the interests \nof data providers. Trustees are, therefore, bound by a fiduciary responsibility that is underpinned by undivided \nloyalty  towards  their  beneficiaries.\n161\n  Undivided  loyalty  requires  the  fiduciary  to  place  the  beneficiary’s  \ninterests over their own and not have any interests that come in conflict with this.\n162\n It is important to note \nthat the identification of fiduciary relationships is context specific and jurisdiction specific.\n163\n The nature of \nfiduciary responsibility may also vary according to the relationship; the fiduciary duty owed by a lawyer to a \nclient  may  vary  from  the  one  owed  by  a  trustee  to  its  beneficiary.  And,  across  common  law  jurisdictions,  \nfiduciary duty has a higher expectation of good faith than the common law conception of ‘reasonable care’.\n164\n \nG\niven the historical distinction in common law between courts of law and courts of equity, fiduciary principles \ndeveloped distinctly as a product of equity. Civil law systems do not make this distinction.  Any exploration \nof the legal frameworks for data trust, needs to be wary of the limitations in relying solely on the common law \nconception  of  trusts.  Notwithstanding  a  few  civil  jurisdictions  that  have  either  ratified  the  Hague  Trust  \nConvention\n165\n or codified trusts within their legal systems, most civil law jurisdictions do not recognise legal \ntrusts.   Envisaging   data   trusts   in   these   settings   will   require   careful   consideration   of   the   fiduciary   \nresponsibilities that data trusts seek to represent and identify functional equivalents of fiduciary-like principles \nof trustee-beneficiary relationships across these different legal systems. \nb) A\nccountability Mechanisms  \nThe recognition of a fiduciary relationship under trust law also ensures accountability mechanisms within the \ndesign of these trusts. A fiduciary relationship is essentially “one in which one party (the fiduciary) exercises \ndiscretionary power over the significant practical interests of another (the beneficiary)”.\n166\n Within legal trusts, \nbeneficiaries  hold  trustees  to  account  by  bringing  claims  against  trustees  if  they  feel  treated  unfairly  or  \ndishonestly.\n167\n  \nSimilarly,accountability mechanisms can also be located in corporate structures through company's annual \ngeneral meetings and provisions that allow the removal of directors. However, in most instances, directors \nowe fiduciary duties towards the company and not the shareholders. \nFurthermore, in legal trusts, the court's equitable jurisdiction gives it broader powers to redress harms arising \nin  fiduciary  relationships.However,  it  needs  to  be  explored  how  such  functional  frameworks  can  be  \ntransposed to or identified in jurisdictions that do not have such legal structures.  \nc)   Identifying the subject matter of the trust \nEven  within  the  current  discourse  on  building  data  trusts  in  common  law  systems,  there  are  differing  \nviewpoints on the reliance of legal trust structures to instantiate data trusts. The ODI’s report on legal and \ngovernance considerations contends that subject-matter requirements for legal trusts impede the conception \nof  data  trusts  within  the  existing  legal  framework.  The  report  asserts  that  data  is  not  capable  of  being  \n                                                      \n161 Delacroix and Lawrence (n 12) \n162 Bristol & West Building Society v Mothew  per Millet LJ \n163 Miller, Paul B (2018), the Oxford Handbook of Fiduciary Law, “ The Identification of Fiduciary Relationships” , Available at SSRN: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3119136 \n164 Clarry, D(2014), International and Comparative Law Quarterly, Fiduciary Ownership And Trusts In A Comparative Perspective.” doi:10.1017/S0020589314000463 \n165 Hague Trust Convention is a multilateral treaty that harmonizes a trust's definition and clarifies the choice of law and applicable rules for governing trusts. Currently, \n14 countries have ratified the convention. \n166Miller, P (2014), Oxford University Press, “ The Fiduciary Relationship” \n167 See Keech v Sandford where the court found  the trustee liable for acting in conflict of interest. \n\n55 \n \nconstituted as property “in the legal trust sense” and, therefore, ‘cannot form the basis of a legal trust’.\n168\n \nHowever, Delacroix and Lawrence, and Lau, Penner, and Wong, in their responses point out that even if this \nassertion of data not being property is made owing to its intangible nature, it does not hold ground as common \nlaw jurisdictions recognise intangible trade assets and bank accounts (the right to payment against a bank) \nas a subject matter of trusts.\n169\n \nMcFarlane  makes  a  larger  point  on  how  it  is  inconsequential  as  to  whether  data  is  property  or  not.\n170\n \n‘Property’  in  the  legal  sense  reflects  different  ideas  in  different  contexts,  and  when  imagining  legal  \nframeworks for data trusts, rather than examining whether a thing is data or not it is important to unbundle \nthe scope rights over different data. McFarlane illustrates this through a scenario where B is owed a certain \namount of money from A arising out of a contract between the two. In this context, the contractual right in \nitself is not a property. However, the rights to receive the money owed are perfectly capable of being held in \ntrust. Unlike rights that define individuals by virtue of their identity as a right holder -  for instance a professional \nlicense  or  a  qualification  - data  rights  are  not  intrinsically  linked  to  a  particular  individual  in  the  same  \nmanner.\n171\n  \nTherefore, under English law, the question of what can be held in data trusts depends on the type of data \nand  the  range  of  positive  rights  available  over  it.  This  also  raises  questions  on  how  these  pooled  rights  \ninteract with each other, and the extent to which they can be disaggregated.  It is important to note that even \nin jurisdictions that recognise trusts, the conception of what can be held as the subject-matter of trusts varies. \nd) Delineating the duties and interests of trustees and beneficiaries of the trust \nThere  are  also  challenges  to  how  one  defines  beneficiaries  (and  their  interests)  and  trustees  (and  their  \nobligations).  The  scope  of  definitions  of  who  or  what  group  constitutes  a  beneficiary  has  implications  on  \nfiduciary actions.\n172\n The ODI report asserts that sharing data for public benefit could be a breach of fiduciary \nduty as trusts in English law requires “the trustees to allow data to be shared only for the benefit of a defined \ngroup  of  beneficiaries”.  The  only  exception,  the  report  notes,  are  charitable  trusts,  which  can  operate  for  \npublic benefit. However, the report falls short of exploring them as it would only be “suitable for a minority of \ndata  trusts”.\n173\n  However,  it  is  worth  noting  that  charitable  trusts  in  commonwealth  jurisdictions  such  as  \nEngland, India and Australia are exempt from the beneficiary principle, i.e., they do not need to have identified \nbeneficiaries, and can operate for the general benefit of the public in furtherance of an (abstract) purpose. \nT\nhe ODI Report also observes that trustees’ obligations not to use the property of the legal trust in a manner \nthat  benefits  themselves  can  create  hurdles  for  beneficiaries  (data  providers)  to  be  trustees.  This  is  not  \nentirely accurate as trustees –   under common law -  can also be beneficiaries of a trust if they are not the \nsole  beneficiary.\n174\n  Trustees,  in  fact,  can  be  remunerated  for  their  services  insofar  as  they  are  not  \nunauthorised or secret profits obtained because of their position.  \n  \n                                                      \n168 Reed C (2019),  BPE solicitors and Pinsent Masons,” Data trusts: Legal and Governance Considerations”  Available at https://theodi.org/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/04/General-legal-report-on-data-trust.pdf \n169 Lau Jia Jun, J., Penner, J., and Wong,B (2019), NUS Law Working Paper,”The Basics of Private and Public Data Trusts”Available at SSRN: \nhttps://ssrn.com/abstract=3458192 or http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3458192 \n170  McFarlane, B (2019), University of Oxford,Data Trusts and Defining Property” Available at https://www.law.ox.ac.uk/research-and-subject-groups/property-\nlaw/blog/2019/10/data-trusts-and-defining-property  \n171Delacroix and Lawrence (n 12) \n172 Mc Donald,S (2019), Centre for International Governance Innovation, “Reclaiming Data Trusts” Available at Reclaiming Data Trusts - Centre for International \nGovernance Innovation (cigionline.org) \n173  Reed C (2019) ,BPE solicitors and Pinsent Masons,” Data trusts: Legal and Governance Considerations” Available at https://theodi.org/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/04/General-legal-report-on-data-trust.pdf \n174 Lau, Penner, and Wong (n 20) \n\n56 \n \ne)   Assigning data rights to third parties  \nIn  most  jurisdictions,  individual  rights  relating  to  data  are  sourced  from  data  protection  laws  and  the  \nrecognition  of  fundamental  rights  within  the  constitution.\n175\n  Data  protection  laws  such  as  the  GDPR,  the  \nLGPD,  and  the  CCPA  recognise  certain  positive  rights  around  access,  use,  erasure,  and  data  portability.  \nWhether current data protection laws allow the assignment of these rights to a third-party (the data trust) is \nan area which remains to be explored.  \nC\noncurrently, personal data protection laws will also have a bearing on data trusts that fall within a specific \njurisdiction. The plurality of bottom-up data trusts and the flexibility in the governance structures of these data \ntrusts mean that the obligation and compliance requirements of a data trust will be dictated by the objects of \nthe  specific  data  trust  and  the  definitions  used  under  the  relevant  personal  data  protection  laws\n176\n.  The  \nGDPR, LGPD, and PDPB for instance, make a distinction between a data controller\n177\n who determines the \npurpose and means of processing; and a data processor who merely “processes personal data on behalf of \nthe controller\". Data controllers have broader and more onerous responsibilities than data processors. The \nCanadian PIPEDA, on the other hand, does not make this distinction. \nT\nhe  interplay  of  various  rights  within  bottom-up  data  trusts  could  also  pose  new  questions  on  the  current  \nframing  of  data  rights.  Collectivised  management  of  data  rights  under  the  trust  framework  would  require  \nbalancing conflicting rights and even the recognition of new data rights altogether. The idea of community \nrights  to  data  advanced  by  India’s  Ministry  of  Electronics  and  Information  Technology’s  (MeitY)  report  on  \nNon-Personal  Data  (NPD)  is  a  case  in  point.\n178\n  The  NPD  framework  proposes  collective  rights  to  privacy  \nover  community  non-personal  data  - in  contrast  to  the  framing  of  rights  over  personal  data  where  the  \nindividual is the focal point of data protection. \nA\nt the most basic level, for data trusts that make decisions on the purposes and means of processing data, \nit  remains  to  be  seen  how  they  will  be  affected  by  the  notice  and  consent  requirements  specified  under  \nvarious data protection laws. This is particularly relevant for data trustees and third parties when processing \npersonal  data  of  individuals  and  communities.  Similarly,  the  principle  of  purpose  limitation  may  pose  \nchallenges for trustees to share data meaningfully. \nHaving identified the challenges, it is evident that the instantiation of data trusts merit analysis that addresses \nquestions  on  the  representation  of  data  rights  by  intermediaries  bound  by  fiduciary  responsibility.  \nConsequently, it is essential to explore the legal landscape of data rights and legislative frameworks across \ndifferent jurisdictions to identify opportunities and gaps in the development of data trusts. Section 2 sets forth \nthe methodology and approach, detailing the considerations that went into framing our analysis. \nCan data rights form the subject matter of trusts across jurisdictions? \nIdentifying what can constitute the subject matter of a trust is essential to the creation of data trusts. \nHowever, the evolution and reliance on the trust framework within jurisdictions that have adopted the \ncommon law system has not been uniform. Many of these countries have codified provisions in ways \nthat may have departed in some ways from the core principles of English law trusts.  For instance, \nunlike  England,  India  and  South  Africa  do  not  recognise  the  concept  of  dual  ownership  for  trusts.  \nSimilarly,  while  courts  in  England  have  recognised  the  ability  for  trusts  to  hold  non-assignable \ncontractual rights in trusts, it is not certain if this would apply to other jurisdictions that have legal trusts.  \nFor  instance,  section  8  of  the  Indian  Trusts  Act,  defines  subject  matter  of  trusts  as  “property  \ntransferable to the beneficiary”. Whether trusts can hold data (or the rights over it) is a question that \nneeds to be examined in greater detail in each of these jurisdictions.   \n                                                      \n175  For eg: South Africa and India recognise the right to privacy within their constitutions. \n176 Subject to the data trusts jurisdiction of operation and the applicability of the relevant data protection legislation \n177 The Indian PDP terms them as data fiduciaries with broadly similarly definitions \n178 The Ministry of Electronics & Information Technology (2020),”Report by the Committee of Experts on Non-Personal Data Governance Framework”  available at \nhttps://static.mygov.in/rest/s3fs-public/mygov_159453381955063671.pdf \n\n57 \n \nSECTION 2 \n \nHaving  reviewed  the  challenges  in  representing  data  trusts  in  the  previous  section,  the \nfollowing section presents the methodology and the resultant framework for the comparative \nanalysis. The methodology develops a function-first approach, outlining the key roles of data \ntrust as an intermediary in the data economy. Building on this, the framework identifies three \nlegislative enablers necessary for creating data trusts that can fulfil these functions. The three \nenablers identified are as follows: \n1. Data protection and rights \n2. Data sharing \n3. Fiduciary obligations \n1. Geographical distribution \n2. Representation of the different legal systems; and \n3. Presence of data protection and sharing frameworks \nHowever,  given  the  complexity  in  comparing  these  enablers  across  such  diverse  legal  \nsystems, there were numerous challenges which the later parts of the section chronicle. \n2.1 Building a function-first framework for legal landscaping   \nMethodology  \nWithin  the  ambit  of  data  stewardship  models  - such  as  cooperatives,  unions,  repositories,  exchanges  or  \npersonal data stores -  data trusts present an explicitly legal challenge. While trust law presents potential as \nan existing legal tool for stewardship, there is a wider legislative environment required for trusts to manage \ndata.  As  discussed  above,  aspects  like  fiduciary  responsibility  or  the  subject  matter  of  a  trust  require  \nuntangling in order to make data trusts feasible. Consequently, differences in various legal systems, their \nfoundations -  whether common law, civil code, or mixed -  and their historical contexts complicate such an \nanalysis.  \nFurther,  theoretical  definitions  around  data  trusts  and  the  roles  embedded  within  them  have  been  varied  \nsince  their  inception  and  continue  to  evolve.  In  order  to  take  the  concept  of  data  trusts  from  abstract  \ndelineation-via-exclusion,  it  is  necessary  to  arrive  at  the  actionable  features  that  follow  from  theoretical  \ndefinitions  of  role  or  responsibility.  Given  these  challenges,  this  research  has  adopted  a  function-first \napproach to legal analysis. \nRole \nCoalescing various definitions of the role or persona of data trusts informed the first leg of building an analysis \nframework. This has been based also on the consensus statement formulated by the Global Partnership on \nArtificial Intelligence, the works of Lawrence and Delacroix, the Ada Lovelace Institute and more as featured \nin the aforementioned literature review. The primary role of a data trust is to act as a trusted intermediary in \nthe move towards a more equitable and agential data economy, particularly for data subjects and generators. \nAlong with rebalancing power asymmetries, data trusts and stewards more broadly are envisioned to enable \ndata-driven innovation for social benefit, and to preemptively protect subjects from potential vulnerabilities \nthat arise from data management. These core ideals can be distilled into the following roles:  \n\n58 \n \n \n1. Protect  \nData trusts must work both to preemptively protect beneficiaries from potential harms arising from the use or \nmisuse of their data, as well as retroactively ensuring avenues for adequate recourse in the event of harm.  \n  \n2. Empower  \nProtection alone does not necessitate agency. A key duty of a data trust, and of other data stewards, must \nbe  to  empower  beneficiaries  through  decision  making,  cognisance  of  data  rights,  and  other  means  of  \nparticipation in their data’s management.\n179\n \n \n3. G\nenerate value \nAs part of rebalancing power and value within data economies, data trusts must be primed to further broader \nsocial and public benefit from data sharing - primarily by promoting data driven innovation and facilitating \ntrusted pathways and environments for the same.  \n \n4. Negotiate  \nThe  framework  of  a  trust  creates  a  dynamic  where  trustees  are  enabled  to  negotiate  on  behalf  of  \nbeneficiaries. This also necessitates a level of skill and expertise in trustees such that they may compensate \nfor asymmetries that hinge on the epistemic disadvantages often faced by data subjects.  \n \n5. Maintain accountability  \nIn order for trustees to effectively prioritise beneficiaries interests, it is necessary to codify a high degree of \naccountability toward beneficiaries. This is enabled in part by fiduciary obligations, which entail duties of skill, \ncare  and  loyalty  toward  beneficiaries,  and  also  in  allowing  judicial  intervention  upon  the  failure  of  such  \nobligations.  \n  \n                                                      \n179\n These means differ across different models of stewardship and their governance/participation structures  \n\n59 \n \nRole → Function \nIn order to evaluate the feasibility of data trusts from a legal lens, it is important to focalise actionable features \nthat correlate to the key roles of a trust. This analysis aims at taking structural analyses of data trusts to a \nfunctional level, and so entailed a delineation of tasks. It is important to note here that despite identifying \nvarious purposes for data trusts (and consequently, data types and beneficiaries), the functions of the data \ntrust remain unchanged.  \n1.   Provide clear and usable redressal mechanisms to beneficiaries in the event of misuse or \nharm. \n2.   Establish safeguards and oversight mechanisms to preemptively prevent misuse or harm. \n3.   Provide a platform for collectives to establish trust terms, conditions and constitution.  \n4.   Proactively identify and define the subject matter of the trust and its use purpose.  \n5.   Enable data sharing and work to make data available for social good through innovation. \n6.   Negotiate the use of trust assets with third parties, and facilitate safe and controlled access \nor use.  \n7.   Appoint  expert  trustees  (professional  managers)  as  stewards,  pertaining  to  the  purpose  \nscope and data types being managed. \n8.   Instil   transparency   mechanisms   for   accountability   and   loyalty   from   trustees   toward   \nbeneficiaries.  \nIn Figure 2.1.1, the correlations across roles and functions are depicted. The primary functions associated \nwith data trusts are associated with a necessary level of expertise, trust and accountability. Certain functions \nact to support these features, such as platform creation and the identification of value pathways from data. \nHowever, it is only through the confluence of all eight that a data trust may be considered primed to fulfil its \nroles. Thus, while the enlisted functions and roles are necessary conditions for a data trust, there may be \nother factors that make up the sufficient conditions. For example, data trusts must be structured with incentive \nmodels  that  allow  for  sustained  accountability,  and  financial  models  that  allow  for  sustained  revenue  or  \nsustenance of the trust. These aspects, discussed further in Section 4, are not necessarily facilitated function-\nfirst,     or     through     legislative     intervention     and thus     do     not     feature     in     our     evaluation.      \n \n \nFigure 2.1.1 depicts the roles, functions of a data trust, as well as the embedded correlations between them \n\n60 \n \nFunction → Enabler \nHaving  identified  the  core  functions  necessary  for  a  data  trust,  there  are  three  legislative  arenas  that  can  \ncome  together  to  enable  such  functions.  Figure  XX  shows  the  logical  flow  from  function  to  these  three  \nfoundational enablers, which have each been elucidated below. Since most countries are still evolving their \ndata regimes and governance strategies, some of these enablers remain unclear within certain jurisdictions \n-  yet, they are an integral part of the preparation toward data trusts and thus necessary to this evaluation.  \n- Data rights and protection  \nIn order to facilitate any kind of principal protection, intermediaries must be armoured with clear and robust \ndigital rights and data protection that will allow them to actionise features around redressal and preemptive \nprotection. It is also important to acknowledge that the regulation of data and the rights afforded to individuals \nmay  adopt  sector-specific  approaches.  For  instance,  the  USA  regulates  data  processing  through  specific  \nlaws  such  as  the  Health  Insurance  Portability  and  Accountability  Act  (HIPAA)  and  the  Children's  Online \nPrivacy Protection Act (COPPA). While the HIPPA recognises access and portability rights over health data, \nthe  COPPA  stipulates  the  processing  limitations  and  consent  requirements  for  children's  data.  In  this  \nanalysis, data protection features as perhaps the most weighted enabler for data trusts. However, beyond \nindividual or collective protection, mature data rights such as portability, findability and accessibility are also \nfoundational to such structures. In order for data protection to translate to the intermediary, data rights must \nhold  definitions  around  delegation,  for  trustees  to  be  able  to  manage  data  on  behalf  of  beneficiaries.  As  \ndiscussed above, while many hold that the subject matter of a trust may be the management of rights -  it is \nunclear in  many  jurisdictions  whether  data  rights  (or  their  execution)  are  transferable  at  all,  and  to  what  \nextent.  Individual  protection  must  be  coupled  with  individual  autonomy  over  data  and,  for  streamlined  \nintermediaries -  clarity on the delegation or exercise of such autonomy.  \n- Data sharing  \nBeyond data protection and data rights, data trusts are situated within a larger ecosystem of data -  one that \nmust be streamlined for data sharing if it is to generate societal value. By many accounts, the eventual vision \nof this ecosystem also includes a plurality of data trusts (for various purposes, types and subjects). Further, \nthe function of enabling innovation and making data available also requires this broader network of varied \ndata  entities.  Based  on  this,  we  have  considered  in  our  analysis  the  availability  and  lucidity  of  legal  \nframeworks for data sharing. This ranges from regulation around data standards, formats, sectoral interplay, \npurpose limitations and sharing agreements -  infrastructure-oriented policy that may seek to build ecosystem-\nwide technical capacity. Moves toward nationwide interoperability, data exchange networks, etc are technical \nelements that can work to build trusted networks for data trusts to rely on. In order to efficiently define data \ntypes  and  purposes  within  a  trust,  legislation  and  broader  policy  efforts  alike  must  also  be  lucid  on  the  \nlimitations and definitions of aspects like ‘public good,’ or ‘innovation purpose’.  \n- Fiduciary obligations  \nCommon law trusts, which may be considered the parent legal framework for data trusts, have been most \neffectively  buttressed  by  conceptions  of  fiduciary  responsibility.  Fiduciary  duties  under  common  law,  as  \ndiscussed in Section 1, allow for levels of accountability and loyalty that many would argue are difficult to \ninstitute contractually. Further, fiduciary duty attempts to mitigate and give legislative importance to the power \nasymmetry associated with a delegation of rights, ownership or more -  particularly given the expertise that a \ntrustee  retains  in  comparison  to  the  typical  beneficiary.  Thus,  this  has  been  the  third  key  enabler  as  we  \nevaluate global jurisdictions. However, there is a marked need to recognise that not all fiduciary duty (across \njurisdictions)  can  be  read  identically,  and  may  be  very  different  in  implementation.  And  in  the  absence  of  \nfiduciary  duty  under  law  (which  is  the  case  for  many  regions  globally)  it  is  important  to  consider  other  \npathways   for   similar   degrees   of   accountability,   loyalty   and   potential   judicial   intervention.   These \nconsiderations  find  mention  in  our  comparative  analysis  (Section  3)  as  well  as  our  application  of  the  \nframework (Section chronicling challenges)  \n \n\n61 \n \n \nFigure 2.1.2 depicts the move from functions of a data trust, to the 3 key legal enablers that they require \nEnablers → Metrics & Indicators  \nOur methodology builds on the three enablers to identify metrics and indicators required to activate the role \nand  functions  of  the  data  trusts.    For  instance,  the  instantiation  of  data  trusts  requires  data  generators  to \nhave rights to portability and erasure to transfer or erase their data held by entities or within different data \ntrusts in the ecosystem.  The feasibility of data trusts is also contingent upon the jurisdiction’s articulation of \ndata sharing principles. Further, policies that articulate purpose and data sharing standards create the right \necosystem for data trusts to further their goals by creating avenues for data sharing. Interoperability of data \nalso  ensures  that  data  generators  can  exercise  their  rights  to  portability  meaningfully.  Similarly,  ex-ante - \nregulatory oversight -and ex-post mechanisms -  through courts -  are vital to hold data trustees accountable. \n \nFigure 2.1.3 details the metrics and related indicators that have been deployed in assessing jurisdictions across the three \nkey enablers \n\n62 \n \n2.2   Selecting jurisdictions - Gating criteria and challenges   \nAs with the establishment of analysis metrics, the selection for input of jurisdictions formed an integral part \nof  this  evaluation.  GIven  the  nascent  nature  of  such  legal  landscaping,  as  well  as  that  of  evolving  data  \nregimes -  there has been no jurisdiction that features a ‘perfect’ analysis, or one that completely addressed \neach of the enablers discussed above. In some cases, this analysis has relied on policy directives or other \nstrategic  documents  and  working  consultations  that  have  been  indicative  of  prospective  legislative  or  \nregulatory approaches. Thus, our gating criteria (detailed below) for the regions that feature in this analysis \nhave been reflexive in application, based on the maturities of various data regimes.  \n1.   Geographical representation \nThe  selection  has  aimed  to  encapsulate  perspectives  and  contexts  of  a  global  nature.  While  numerous  \nacademic  initiatives  have  captured  the  movement  of  data  governance  in  more  developed  countries,  it  is  \nimportant to guard against systems that may end up ignoring the needs of a truly global context. Particularly \nfor data and its ubiquitous nature, it is increasingly necessary to evaluate the direction and presence of policy \nin countries that may not map to the same levels of capital or technical infrastructure. The unique challenges \nof  earlier  stages  are  not  only  valuable  to  the  assessment  of  feasibility  of  data  trusts,  but  are  important  to  \nconsider  when  attempting  to  build  structures  of  governance  that  seek  to  empower  communities  across  \nborders, and of various societal structures. Thus, our eventual list features nations making up both the Global \nNorth and South.  \n2.   Representation of various legal systems  \nWhile  trust  law  features  most  foundationally  through  common  law  systems,  this  research  has  aimed  to  \nevaluate jurisdictions without a limitation to common law. A key gating criteria has been the representation \nof various legal systems including civil codes or mixed legal systems (that are founded on both common and \ncivil law structures). In doing so, there have been numerous challenges to the evaluation, given that often \neven matching legal systems operate very distinctly in execution. In the case of fiduciary obligations as well, \neach  region  has  unique  frameworks  and  in  the  case  of  civil  code,  alternative  pathways  to instilling \naccountability and loyalty. Our next section chronicles some of these challenges. \n3.   Presence of data protection and data sharing frameworks \nIn order for this analysis to form a basis to future legal review, as well as be indicative of current motions in \ndata governance -  the third criteria has been a degree of discourse around data protection and data sharing. \nWhile  the  majority  of  this  analysis  draws  from  enacted  legislation  or  prospective  legislation  under  \nconsultation, certain countries present valuable trends and frameworks while still functioning at the level of \ndiscussion or formulation. We found some of these to be important in this landscaping as they speak to global \nemerging patterns for conceptions of data trusts or intermediaries. \n \nFigure 2.2.1 depicts the jurisdictions selected for this analysis, and the primary criteria applied in this selection \n\n63 \n \n2.3 Chronicling decisions/challenges :   \nThe bulk of this research deals with differences between various jurisdictions on the issue of data protection, \nrights and avenues for intermediaries. As with any comparative exercise, our selection of these jurisdictions \nand  application  of  the  analysis  framework  faced  numerous  pain  points  that  required  our  approach  to  be  \niterative.  \nWhile  the  aim  of  this  analysis  has  been  to  incorporate  diverse  legal  systems,  it  greatly  complicates  the  \nassessment of legal enablers; given that data trusts are conceptualised from common law legal trusts. They \nare  underpinned  most  fundamentally  by  the  fiduciary  duty  of  undivided  loyalty.  With  common  law  trusts  \nrecognized  in  very  few  civil  law  jurisdictions,  our  framework  has  included  both  civil  legal  systems  that  \nrecognise trusts (Quebec and South Korea) and civil legal systems that do not (Germany and Brazil). In order \nto provide a landscaping on such countries, we adapted the framework and sought fiduciary-like obligations \nthat may inspire or buttress the creation of data trusts.  \nThe application of gating criteria for jurisdictions too, has remained reflexive and non-linear. For example, \nour selection needed to be cognisant of growing discourse, and not exclusively officialised legislation. In the \ncase of Ghana, data-related legislation reflects many regulatory overlaps, and a dearth of codification around \ndata sharing or intermediaries. However, given a strong level of political will toward data for public benefit, \nand a considerable shift in private sector receptivity to such regulation -  it became a key focus region for our \nanalysis. Additionally, to ensure uniformity in our comparison of legislation, our analysis has narrowed on \njurisdictions that have or are moving towards federal overarching data protection regulations. This has meant \nthe exclusion of the USA from our comparative analysis, which is currently the only OECD country that adopts \na sectoral approach to regulating the use and processing of data. \nThe resultant framework  \nBased on the methodology, functions, enablers and metrics detailed above, we arrive at a working framework \nto evaluate the global legal landscape for enabling data trusts. Figure 2.3.1. depicts a ‘preparedness’ scale \nthat has been applied to each jurisdiction based on primary analysis of policy approaches and staged. The \nlevels  illustrate  the  spectrum  of  clarity  with  which  each  metric  is  defined  in  a  particular  jurisdiction.  The  \nenablers are made comprehensive by the four metrics utilised under each of them. \nWhile the levels illustrate the clarity with which each metric is defined in a particular jurisdiction, the circles \non the left capture the comprehensiveness of the four metrics under each enabler. For instance, jurisdictions \nthat recognise specific personal data rights -   such as access, portability, and erasure -  which are necessary \nfor the development and operation of data trusts will place closer to the green shade of the scale, and for \njurisdictions that have a weak conceptualisation of these data rights will be reflected closer to the left end \ni.e., red bit of the spectrum.  \nWhen interpreting this illustrated framework, it must also be noted that in capturing the recognition of these \nmetrics, we must also account for the possibilities or restrictions that play out differently in each jurisdiction. \nIt is, therefore, difficult to represent any of these metrics at extreme ends of the spectrum. For instance, while \nthe GDPR recognises the right to erasure under Article 17, it is not an absolute right and has limitations as \nto when it can be exercised. Similarly, while some jurisdictions may not legislatively recognise certain rights, \nthey may be represented through softer forms of laws such as policies and frameworks.  \n\n64 \n \n \nFigure 2.3.1 depicts the analysis framework that will be applied to each region (levels in this figure do not pertain to a \nparticular jurisdiction, and are purely illustrative) \nIt  is  important  to  note  that  given  the  diverse  nature  of  this  analysis,  and  of  the  jurisdictions  featured,  this  \nframework is not intended to be objectively linear or overly prescriptive. Instead, it provides a helpful indicative \nparadigm that the authors hope will be dynamic, and augmented by further research in these arenas, as data \nregimes  make  their  nature  and  outcomes  clearer  over  time.  The  deconstruction  of  new  data  governance  \nstructures, particularly human-centric structures, requires a level of deconstruction; one that this study has \napproached by function. Section 3 details the comparative legal analysis of each country listed, based on \nthis framework, contextualised by the unique status and challenges of each region.  \nSECTORAL INSIGHTS : Snapshots from across the globe \nNote: These snippets -  featured here as boxes -  will be scattered across the length of the report as a design \nbreak from the main content. They are currently placed together for review, but do not form their own section. \n \nConsumer Data Right - Sectoral data sharing in Australia \nAustralia has taken collaborative efforts between different regulatory bodies to enable data flow \nacross sectors. For instance, Australia’s Consumer Data Right (CDR), a joint effort between the \nAustralian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC), the Office of the Australian \nInformation Commissioner (OAIC), and the Data Standards Body (DSB), is currently being rolled \nout to enable consumers to access and transfer their information in standardised formats. CDR \naims to increase innovation and competition in the banking sector by mandating financial entities \nto share data. Customers have the freedom to share their banking data with competitors to \ncompare products and services. The rollout of the CDR will take place in a phased manner, with \ntelecommunications and the energy sector as the next identified sectors. \n \n\n65 \n \nConsent  managers  as  data  intermediaries  – Data  Empowerment  and  \nProtection Architecture  \nIn  India,  Niti  Aayog,  the  government’s  public  policy  think  tank,  has  introduced  the  Data  \nEmpowerment   and   Protection   Architecture   (DEPA),   as   a   consent-based   data-sharing \nframework that “empowers people to seamlessly and securely access their data and share it \nwith  third  party  institutions”.  It  proposes  the  creation  of  ‘consent  managers’,  which  are  \ninstitutions that will mediate interactions between data holders and users.  \n In the financial sector, consent managers take the form of Account Aggregators, which are \nconsent dashboards that allow financial entities to share data –   with the user’s consent –   in \nareas  such  as  banking,  insurance,  and  pension.  Essentially,  Account  Aggregators  facilitate  \ndata  sharing  by  mediating  between  financial  institutions  that  hold  user  data  with  Financial  \nInformation Users who rely on such information to improve services. \n \nCross-sectoral data sharing in Ghana \nGhana’s data collaboration initiative between Vodafone Ghana, Flowminder, and the Ghana \nStatistical  Service  (GSS)  illustrates  a  cross-sectoral  and  problem-specific  approach  to  data  \ngovernance. Under the three-way agreement signed in 2019, GSS receives pseudonymised \nmobile  data  records  from  Vodafone  Ghana,  which  are  aggregated  and  analysed  by  \nFlowminder. \nWhile the data-sharing arrangement was initially conceptualized to contain the spread of Ebola \nvirus,  it  is  now  being  used  to  inform  policy  in  the  government’s  response  to  the  COVID-19 \npandemic.  For  instance,  the  analysis  of  aggregated  mobile  data  has  been  relied  on  to  \nunderstand  the  impact  of  pandemic  restrictions  in  population  movements  as  part  of  the  \ngovernment’s COVID-19 response efforts.  \n \nMyData - South Korea’s sectoral approach to data reuse \nLaunched as part of Korea’s Digital New Deal, MyData is an ambitious initiative that aims to \ncreate a common platform to share data amongst different organisations and the government \nto improve financial, health, and public services. The integration of individuals' data is made \npossible  through  their  national  identification  system  that  issues  every  resident  a  unique  \nidentification number linked with their biometric data. \nThe  platform  will  give  accredited  operators  access  to  consumer  information  to  develop  \ninnovative financial products through data analysis in the financial sector by obliging financial \ninstitutions  to  provide  customer  personal  information  through  an  application  programming  \ninterface (API). The interoperability of data will allow consumers access to all their financial \ninformation in one place. \nSimilarly,  in  the  health  sector,  the  My  HealthWay  app  provides  integrated  management  of \nhealth  information  from  National  Health  Insurance  records,  Health  Insurance  Review  and  \nAssessment Services, and the Disease Control and Prevention Agency. By 2023, the Korean \nMinistry of Health and Welfare aims to provide individuals with all their health records in the \nMyHealthWay app. \n \n  \n\n66 \n \nEuropean Health Data Space \nRealising  the  potential  of  data  availability  and  reuse,  the  EU  is  pushing  for  common  data  \nspaces  in  strategic  sectors  to  create  a  data  sharing  ecosystem.  Health  is  one  such  sector  \nwhere  the  European  Commission  is  currently  building  a  European  Health  Data  Space  in  \ncollaboration with the EU member states. In line with this, Europe’s joint action Towards the \nEuropean Health Data Space (TEHDAS) project, coordinated by the Finnish Innovation Fund \nSitra and co-funded by the Health Programme of the European Union, is currently engaging \nwith partners from different member states to advance the secondary use of health data. The \nproject  focuses  on  governance,  data  quality,  and  infrastructure  requirements  to  support  the  \nsecondary use of data. \nAdditionally, the European Commission has advanced legislative proposals such as the Data \nGovernance Act and the Data Act that seek to overcome barriers and legal uncertainties in \nsharing  and  using  data  held  by  public  and  private  actors.  While  the  Data  Act  intends  to  \nharmonise the different regulations that pertain to the use and access of private and public \nsector  data,  the  Data  Governance  Act  seeks  to  create  an  overarching  framework  for  data  \nsharing through safeguards that develop trusted sharing. \n \n \n \n  \n\n67 \n \nSECTION 3 \nThe  following  section  of  the  report  builds  on  the  framework  developed  in  section  2  to  conduct  a  \ncomparative analysis of the following eleven jurisdictions:  \n1.   Germany \n2.   England and Wales \n3.   India \n4.   Canada \n5.   South Africa \n6.   South Korea \n7.   Australia \n8.   Singapore \n9.   Kenya \n10.  Brazil \n11.  Ghana \n \nThe comparative analysis evaluates the jurisdictions across the three enablers -  data protection and \nrights, data-sharing frameworks, and fiduciary obligations -  identified as necessary for data trusts to \nfunction. The following takeaways emerge from the comparative analysis: \n● The  appreciation  of  data  rights  and  articulation  of  data  sharing  varies  considerably  across  \ndifferent jurisdictions. However, there is still progress in some jurisdictions without formal data \nrights,  seen  in  countries  like  Brazil,  Ghana,  Canada,  India,  and  South  Africa  having  either  \namended existing laws or in the process of enacting new laws to define rights over personal \ndata. \n● The analysis found that a number of jurisdictions lacked personal data rights such as portability \nand  erasure.  This  can  create  barriers  for  data  trustees  to  represent  the  interests  of  their  \nbeneficiaries. \n● Except for legislation and proposals that allow the delegation of consent in a few jurisdictions \nsuch as South Korea, Canada, and India, most personal data protection laws do not support \nthis. \n● While civil law jurisdictions like Germany and Brazil do not recognise fiduciary relationships, \nfiduciary-like  obligations  can  be  created  contractually.  Even  within jurisdictions  that  have  \ncodified trusts, there is legal uncertainty about whether they can hold rights over data. \n \n3.1 :  Background to Comparative analysis \nHaving  arrived  at  this  framework,  the  following  section  carries  out  a  comparative  analysis  of  the  selected  \ncountries to explore the varying degrees of enablers the identified jurisdictions have in place. As mentioned \nabove, the analysis focuses on three primary legal enablers -  data protection and data rights; data sharing \nframeworks, and fiduciary obligations. Similarly, each analysis is buttressed with the scales of preparedness \nbased on metrics devised and elucidated earlier.  \nConsidering the European Union’s role in influencing jurisdictions outside the EU to their approach to data \nsharing and data regulation, the start of this comparative exercise features an overview of the EU's landscape \non data rights and data sharing. \n  \n\n68 \n \nData protection and sharing in the European Union  \nPersonal data protection laws in the European Union are primarily covered by the GDPR (the ‘Regulation’). \nThe Regulation has been widely influential for its approach to data regulation and the rights afforded to data \nsubjects, serving as a lodestar for numerous jurisdictions outside the EU seeking to enact data protection \nlaws.  \nChapter  three  of  the  GDPR  covers  the  broad  range  of  rights  available  to  data  subjects,  recognising  eight  \nfundamental rights - \na)   The right to be informed  \nb)   The right of access  \nc)   The right of rectification  \nd)   The right to erasure  \ne)   The right to restrict processing  \nf)  The right to data portability  \ng)   The right to object  \nh)   Rights of automated decision making and profiling  \nIn 2020, the EU released the European Data Strategy\n180\n as a policy intervention to create a single market \nfor  data  sharing  across  different  sectors.  One  of  the  outcomes  of  this  is  the  proposed  Data  Governance  \nAct\n181\n, which among other regulations, proposes to recognise a new entity - ‘data intermediaries’ - to    manage \ndata  flow  between  different  actors  in  the  ecosystem.  However,  the  draft  legislation  is  ambiguous  on  the  \npotential for delegation of the personal data  rights conferred under GDPR. While it does not explicitly mention \ndata trusts, one of the recitals in the draft legislation states that rights under the GDPR “can only be exercised \nby each individual and cannot be conferred or delegated to a data cooperative”\n182\n.   \nThe EU has also taken steps to encourage data sharing and data re-use. One such proposal is the Data Act, \nwhich aims to incentivise horizontal data flow between organisations across sectors. The proposed legislation \nseeks to define the scope and contours of co-generated data rights among its other objectives.

Germany  \n \n \na)   Data Protection and Data Rights \nAt  the  national  level,  Germany  complemented  the  GDPR\n183\n  (Regulation)  with  the  German  Federal  Data  \nProtection  Act  (BDSG)\n184\n  and  the Second  Data  Protection  Adaptation  and  Implementation  Act  EU\n185\n  to \neffectuate open provisions in the GDPR that are left to the member states to define. The BDSG specifies \ngeneral rules and requirements for data processing applicable to the public and private sector. \nWhile the rights to access, erasure, and portability are instrumental for individuals to move their data (or the \nrights over it) from one data Trust to another, at a foundational level, data Trusts need to have the authority \nto manage data rights. These rights extend to personal data, defined under Article 4(1) of the GDPR as any \n‘information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (‘data subject’)’. Currently, these rights can \nonly  be  held  by  data  subjects  as  the  Regulation  does  not  permit  the  transfer  of  data  rights,  nor  does  it  \nrecognise the collective representation or pooling of these rights. Similarly, it is unclear if there are restrictions \non  the  transfer  of  rights  to  a  third  party  (data  trust)  through  assignment  of  consent.  Consent  of  the  data  \nsubject is one of the foundational legal bases for processing personal data under GDPR, and is (as per Article \n6(1) of the Regulation) sought from the data subject for specific identified purposes.\n186\n \n                                                      \n183 General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), 2018 \nAvailable at: <https://gdpr-info.eu/> [Accessed 9 May 2018]. \n184  Federal Data Protection Act (BDSG) of 30 June 2017.Available at: <https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_bdsg/englisch_bdsg.html>. \n185Gabel,D  (2019),“  German  Bundestag  passes  second  act  on  adaptation  of  data  protection  law  to  GDPR”,  Available  at  https://www.whitecase.com/publications/alert/german-bundestag-\npasses-second-act-adaptation-data-protection-law-gdpr \n186 Consent for broad purposes is allowed for scientific research \n\n70 \n \nb) Data sharing frameworks  \nIn recent years, after the enactment of the GDPR, the EU has been exploring ways to regulate and open \ndata flows amongst its member states through legislation like the amended Open Data Directive\n187\n and the \nRegulation  on  the  free  flow  of  non-personal  data  (FFD)\n188\n.  In  line  with  this,  the  German  government  \nannounced their data strategy on January 21st, 2021 to promote data usage. The strategy prioritises four \nfields to enable this: \n1.   C\nreating effective and sustainable digital infrastructure  \n2.   Innovative and responsible use of data \n3.   Increasing digital literacy  \n4.   Improve the state’s digital infrastructure and capacity  \nTo this end, the German government has established a National Research Data Infrastructure to improve \naccess  to  data  for  research.\n189\n  This  is  also  in  addition  to  the    GAIA-X\n190\n,  which  is  a  federated  data  \ninfrastructure that aims to create a digital ecosystem across Europe. Backed strongly by France and Europe, \nthe move will create interoperable standards that will allow the movement of data across different silos. The \ninitiative is also viewed as an attempt to assert Europe’s digital sovereignty.\n191\n \nc)   Fiduciary obligations \nAs  highlighted  in  sections  above,  in  English  law,  fiduciary  duties  - as  in  the  case  of  trusts  -    developed \ndistinctly through principles of equity, imposing a stricter standard of care of one party. English law takes the \nview  that  contracts  are  self-interested  relationships  where  each  party  pursues  only  their  own  interests.  \nGermany, having a civil legal system, does not make this distinction in recognising fiduciary duties. These \nduties  are,  in  fact,  embedded  contractually  or  through  specific  statutes  that  identify  relationships  that  \nnecessitate the recognition of fiduciary duties, thereby existing in a continuum and not separately.\n192\n  \nOne such mechanism is the treuhand. In a treuhand, the transferor transfers their assets (and its ownership) \nto the trustee.\n193\n However, while the ownership rests with the trustee, the trustee is bound by ‘mandate’, a \ntype  of  agency  relationship.  Mandate  is  a  legal  relationship that  permits  one  party  to  represent  or  act  on  \nbehalf of the other.\n194\n It remains unclear whether data trusts can be recognised in this relationship. \nMoreover, courts can only intervene only where such obligations arise contractually or through the operation \nof these specific statutes. However, even then, courts in civil legal systems may not have the same flexibility \nto evaluate decision-making of trustees in polycentric aspects that arise in the administration of trusts. \n  \n                                                      \n187 Directive (EU) 2019/1024 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 June 2019 on open data and the re-use of public sector information \nPE/28/2019/REV/1 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/dir/2019/1024/oj \n188 Regulation (EU) 2018/1807 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 14 November 2018 on a framework for the free flow of non-personal data in the European Union \nPE/53/2018/REV/1 Available at: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2018/1807/oj \n189 National Research Data Infrastructure, 2021 Available at: <https://www.dfg.de/en/research_funding/programmes/nfdi/index.html>.  \n190See, <https://www.data-infrastructure.eu/GAIAX/Navigation/EN/Home/home.html>.  \n191Delcker, J. and Heikkilä, M(2020), POLITICO, “ Germany, France launch Gaia-X platform in bid for ‘tech sovereignty. “.

However,  GDPR’s  current  conceptualisation  of  rights  over  personal  data  does  not  \nacknowledge the rights to mandate individual rights over data, which greatly hinders the possibility of setting \nup data trust-like initiatives. .  \nWhile Germany does not distinguish fiduciary duties in the same way as English law, it does recognise similar \nobligations  contractually,  allowing  courts  to  intervene  in  disputes  arising  in  the  performance  of  these  \nobligations. However, reliance on contractual obligations can create difficulties for representing rights, which \nrequires specific contractual relationships with each individual wishing to participate in a data trust. Similarly, \nthe absence of a legal trust framework requires either the adoption of existing structures such as companies \nor associations, or the recognition of a new class of intermediaries that can carry out the functions of a data \ntrust. \nThe  Opinion  of  Data  Ethics  Commission  recognises  great  potential  in  data  management  and  data  trust  \nschemes to empower individuals to take control over their personal data. The commission also recognises \nthe “Right to digital self determination” and is against the idea of data ownership and believes that contribution \nto  generation  of  data  must  lead  to  “  data  specific  rights  of  co-determination  and  participation”  which  is  \ndependent on several factors. The Commission also recommends clarification of S.311 of the German Civil \nCode  to  include  quasi-contractual  duties  which  are  fiduciary  in  nature  for  data  controllers.  These  \nrecommendations show that Germany is attempting to codify fiduciary obligations and adopting data trust-\nlike schemes. \n2. England and Wales \n \n\n72 \n \na)   Data Protection and Data Rights \nPost-Brexit, the UK was categorised as a third country by the EU under the GDPR\n195\n. However, the free flow \nof information continues to occur through a decision adopted by the EU on the adequacy of protection of \npersonal data by the United Kingdom\n196\n. The UK Data Protection Act 2018\n197\n was legislated to adopt the EU \nGDPR, with minor procedural and cosmetic amendments. It, therefore, recognises the same rights for data \nsubjects -  as discussed above -  set out under the EU GDPR\n198\n. Unless data is anonymised completely, data \ntrusts in both the EU and the UK will have to ensure that processing is carried under one of the six lawful \nbases for processing data. \nb) D\nata sharing frameworks \nIn 2020, the UK government published the National Data Strategy\n199\n to explore opportunities and avenues \nfor  data  use.  In  line  with  this,  the  government  identified  four  pillars  -    foundations,  skills,  availability  and  \nresponsibility -  that align to its actions or ‘missions’. The five missions are to: unlock the value of data across \nthe economy; secure a pro-growth and trusted data regime; transform government’s use of data; ensure the \nsecurity and resilience of its data infrastructure, and engage in the international flow of data.\n200\n \nTo  advance  the  aims  set  out  in  the  National  Data  Strategy,  the  Centre  for  Data  Ethics  and  Innovation  \npublished  an  independent  report,  commissioned  by  the  Department  for  Digital  Culture,  Media,  and  Sport  \n(DCMS),  to  explore  ways  in  which  data  intermediaries  could  support  data  sharing.\n201\n  Identifying  existing  \norganisations  that  play  the  role  of  data  intermediaries  in  the  current  digital  economy,  the  report  suggests  \nways in which intermediaries can enhance the value of publicly and privately available data. \nO\nn 10 September 2021, as part of one of its missions to “secure a pro-growth and trusted data regime”, the \ngovernment  launched  a  consultation  to  reform  its  data  protection  laws.\n202\n  The  proposal  seeks  to  remove  \nbarriers in the current General Data Protection Regulation (UK GDPR) to support “vibrant competition and \ninnovation  to  drive  economic  growth”.\n203\n  Equally,  the  Department  for  Digital,  Culture,  Media  and  Sport  \n(DCMS) has proposed broadening the remit of the Information Commissioner's Office to “champion sectors \nand  businesses  that  are  using  personal  data  in  new,  innovative  and  responsible  ways  to  benefit  people’s  \nlives” in areas such as healthcare and financial services\n204\n. \nc)   Fi\nduciary Obligations  \nFiduciary principles in English common law can be traced back to the courts of equity in Medieval England \nwhich typically relied on notions of undivided loyalty and good faith to recognise ownership of property held \nin trusts. Until the 19th century, remedies from common law and equity were distinctly applicable. In 1873, \nthe Parliament passed the Judicature Act that merged the Court of Chancery and Court of Law to the High \nCourt, which applies either principle as applicable\n205\n. Therefore, the law of trusts and fiduciary was purely a \ncreation of the Court of Chancery institutionalised into common law.  \nT\nrusts are typified by a fiduciary relationship between the trustee and the trust’s beneficiaries. Unlike other \nfiduciary  relationships  - a  doctor  and  a  patient  or  a  director  and  the  company,  for  instance  - trustees  are  \nbound  by  stricter  standards  of  loyalty  and  a  duty  of  care/prudence.  Trustees  who  fail  to  uphold  these  \n                                                      \n195 See <https://ico.org.uk/media/for-organisations/documents/brexit/2617110/information-rights-and-brexit-faqs-v2_3.pdf>. \n196See <https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/international-transfers-after-uk-exit/>. \n197Data Protection Act, 2018.

This counteracts potential \nex-post disputes, which often arise in agency relationships where agents engage in self-dealing.  \nKey takeaways \nNaturally, trusts' institutional and legal origins in England and Wales make it the most suitable for instantiating \ndata trusts through trust law. Additionally, the influence of GDPR in the UK’s recognition of rights of access, \nportability, and erasure creates a suitable ecosystem for developing a plurality of data trusts.  \nHowever, given the different rules that can apply to data, there needs to be legislative certainty across various \nsectors  for  data  trusts  to  access  and  use  data  meaningfully.  For  instance,  the  proposed  Data  Act  in  the  \nEuropean Union aims to bring legal certainty by harmonising the different regulations –   e.g., database rights, \ntrade secrets –   that can affect the access and use of data.  \nAlthough trusts traditionally lack regulatory oversight, charitable trusts in the UK fall within the remit of the \nCharity Commission. Given current attempts to pilot data trusts in the UK, the scope and requirements for \nex-ante regulation for the functioning of data trusts is a potential safeguard mechanism worth considering. \n3. India  \n \na)   Data protection and Data Rights \nWhile India recognises the fundamental right to privacy within Article 21\n206\n (right to life and liberty), it is still \nyet to enact dedicated data protection legislation. Currently, data protection is regulated by the Information \n                                                      \n206  Article 21 of the Constitution of India \n\n74 \n \nTechnology Act, 2000 (IT Act), and the rules under it\n207\n. For instance, the distinction between personal data \nand sensitive personal data is made in the IT (Reasonable Security Practices and Procedures and Sensitive \nPersonal  Data  or  Information)  Rules  framed  under  the  IT  Act  (SPDI  Rules)\n208\n.  Section  43A  of  the  IT  Act  \ngrants individuals the right to claim compensation for wrongful loss if body corporates do not have reasonable \nsecurity measures in place. SPDI rules define personal information as any information that relates to a natural \nperson which, either directly or indirectly, in combination with other available or likely available information, \nmay identify that person\n209\n. \nWhile the IT Act’s conception of data protection is quite limited in scope, only recognising consent, access, \nand correction rights, the proposed Personal Data Protection Bill (PDPB)\n210\n, drafted in the backdrop of the \nlandmark judgement that recognised the right to privacy\n211\n, extends additional rights like the right to erasure \nand portability. The PDP Bill also envisages giving data principals the right to delegate the exercise of their \nagency (provide or withdraw consent) to a new category of data fiduciaries termed as consent managers\n212\n. \nConcurrently, the Indian Government has also published a report on the regulation of non-personal data. It \nproposes collective privacy rights over non-personal data in contrast to the framing of rights over personal \ndata, where the individual is the focal point.  \nb) Data sharing frameworks  \nIn  recent  years,  NITI  Aayog,  the  Indian  government’s  public  policy  think  tank,  has  mooted  techno-legal \napproaches to enhance access to and sharing of data. The proposed Data Empowerment and Protection \nArchitecture  (DEPA)\n213\n,  for  instance,  is  public-private  collaboration  that  builds  on  the  concept  of  consent  \nmanagers to create a platform that allows data transfers from one entity to another. The finance sector and \nhealth  sector  have  already  made  some  inroads  through  the  adoption  of  ‘account  aggregators’  and  the  \nNational Health Stack\n214\n.   \nAt the same time, there are proposals to create interoperable sharing infrastructure for non-personal data.\n215\n \nThe  report  on  the  Non-Personal  Data  Governance  Framework  (the  “NPDR”)  report  recognises  beneficial  \ninterests  over  community  data.  The  committee  identifies  five  key  principles  to  ascertain  community  rights  \nover data: (i) a community’s right over resources associated collectively with it; (ii) consent of the community \nfor use of such resources; (iii) benefit sharing with the community; (iv) transparency in recording community \nresources to prevent misuse and enable easy access of the legitimate kind; and (v) community’s participation \nin governance of community resources.\n216\n The NPDR also recommends the creation of ‘data trustees’ as  \nintermediaries to exercise rights on behalf of the group/community. The committee sources this community \nright  from  Article  39(b)  and  (c)  of  the  Indian  Constitution  (Directive  Principles  of  State  Policy)\n217\n  which \nstipulates that the ownership and control of resources ought to be distributed to serve the common good and \nto prevent the concentration of wealth. \n  \n                                                      \n207 The Information Technology Act 2000,  \nsee https://www.indiacode.nic.in/bitstream/123456789/13116/1/it_act_2000_updated.pdf \n208 ibid. \n209 ibid. \n210 Personal Data Protection Bill 2019,  \nsee http://164.100.47.4/BillsTexts/LSBillTexts/Asintroduced/373_2019_LS_Eng.pdf \n211 Justice K.S.

Fiduciary obligations can also be located in other relationships, such as an agent to a principal and \ndirectors to their company. In the Supreme Court case of the Reserve Bank of India v. Jayantilal N. Mistry\n219\n, \nthe court observed that fiduciaries owe “undivided loyalty to the beneficiary, not to place himself in a position \nwhere his duty towards one person conflicts with a duty that he owes to another customer\". \nT\nhe  Trusts  Act  pertains  to  private  trusts,  which  are  essentially  trusts  with  clearly  identified  beneficiaries.  \nPublic trusts must be created for charitable, educational, religious or scientific purposes and be for the benefit \nof  a  specific  class  or  the  general  public.  The  Trusts  Act  recognises  obligations  such  as  loyalty,  care,  and  \nprudence through various provisions that impose duties and liabilities on trustees. For instance, section 14 \nof the Act requires the trustee to ensure that the title of the trust property is not dealt with (self dealing or \notherwise) in a manner that adversely affects the beneficiary.\n220\n Similarly, section 15 mandates the trustee \nto deal with the trust property “a man of ordinary prudence would deal with such property if it were his own''.\n221\n  \nHowever, the subject-matter of a trust must be property that is transferable to the trust.\n222\n The development \nof case law on the scope of the subject-matter is limited. It is, therefore, unclear,  data (or the rights over it) \ncan constitute as the subject matter of trusts under Indian law.  Moreover, unlike in English law, the Indian \nTrusts Act does not recognise the concept of dual-ownership. Beneficiaries only have a beneficial interest \nagainst the trustee, who is the sole owner of the trust property. \nKey takeaways \nAlthough restricted to non-personal data, India’s Non-Personal Data Governance Framework report offers a \nunique articulation of data trustees to manage community rights over data. The report proposes data trustees \nas intermediaries representing and protecting the community's interests by recognising collective rights over \nprivacy. However, the current framework does not identify procedural safeguards or mechanisms that can \nhold trustees accountable. \nWhile India has codified trusts and trustee's fiduciary responsibilities, the feasibility for legal trusts to hold \ndata rights as the subject matter lacks legal certainty. Moreover, in the absence of dedicated data protection \nlegislation,  India’s  recognition  of  individual  rights  over  personal  data  remains  weak,  further  restricting  the  \npossibility of data trusts' to act as intermediaries.   \n \n \n                                                      \n218The Indian Trusts Act 1882, see https://legislative.gov.in/sites/default/files/A1882-02.pdf \n219 RBI vs Jayantilal Mistry https://main.sci.gov.in/supremecourt/2019/31871/31871_2019_37_1503_27802_Judgement_28-Apr-2021.pdf \n220  Section 13 of the Indian Trusts Act 1882, see https://legislative.gov.in/sites/default/files/A1882-02.pdf \n221  Section 15 of the Indian Trusts Act 1882, see https://legislative.gov.in/sites/default/files/A1882-02.pdf \n222 Section 8 of the Indian Trusts Act 1882, see https://legislative.gov.in/sites/default/files/A1882-02.pdf \n\n76 \n \n4. Canada  \n \n \na)   Data protection and Data rights \nData protection in Canada is governed by a mix of general and sector-specific legislation, both at a federal \nand provincial level.\n223\n At the federal level, Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act \n2000 (PIPEDA)\n224\n regulates the private organisations’ use of personal data and the Privacy Act\n225\n governs \nthe public sector’s use of personal data. The legislation was amended several times since it was first enacted \nin  2000,  the most  significant  amendment  being  the  Digital  Privacy  Act\n226\n  in  2015  which  expanded  the  \nInformation  Commissioner’s  powers  and  introduced  mandatory  breach  notification.  Under  the  current  \nframework, individuals have limited right to access and seek correction of their personal data.\n227\n \nOn November 17, 2020, the federal government tabled the Digital Charter Implementation Act\n228\n to overhaul \nthe  current  privacy  legislation.  The  Act  introduces  substantial  changes  to  the  current  privacy  framework,  \nincluding  the  new  Consumer  Privacy  Protection  Act  (CPPA),  which  seeks  to  regulate  privacy  laws  in  the  \n                                                      \n223 Quebec, British Columbia, and Alberta have their own provincial statutes. \n224Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada,PIPEDA legislation and related regulations - Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada.

In addition to the existing rights to access and correction, the Bill introduces rights of erasure \nand portability.  \nb) D\nata sharing frameworks  \nAt the governmental level, machine readable public sector data is made available for reuse under its Open \nGovernment  Initiative.\n230\n  Only  data  that  is  safe,  legally  permissible,  and  not  identifiable  to  individuals  is  \nshared. Departments of the government also have a sectoral approach to data sharing. The Pan-Canadian \nHealth  Data  Strategy,  for  instance,  empowers  the  Corporate  Services  Branch  (CSB)  and  the  Business  \nRenewal  and  Enterprise  Architecture  Directorate  (BREAD)  “to  effectively  use  data  as  an  asset  to  provide  \ncredible information, reliable advice and quality services”\n231\n. \nAdditionally  there  have  been  efforts  at  a  cross-sectoral  level  to  increase  data  sharing  by  improving  \ninteroperability of data. For instance, in 2019, the Standards Council of Canada constituted the Canadian \nData  Governance  Standardization  Collaborative  (DGSC),  comprising  over  200  members  of  stakeholders  \nfrom various industries, civil society, and academia to streamline data standardization practices by keeping \nall stakeholders in mind\n232\n. \nc)   Fi\nduciary obligations \nCanada’s  influence  of  both  civil  and  common  law  origins  makes  it  a  unique  jurisdiction  of  study.  While  \ncommon  law  in  Canada  extends  fiduciary  duties  beyond  trustee  and  beneficiary  relationships,  civil  law  in  \nQuebec does not recognise these fiduciary relationships. Like many civil law jurisdictions, the Quebec Civil \nCode codifies obligations of good faith and loyalty within contractual relationships.\n233\n \nExcept in Quebec, which has civil law trusts, provinces of Canada have common law origins of trusts. And \nin contrast to common law trusts, which are based on the principle of ownership with obligation owed by the \ntrustees towards its beneficiaries, trusts in Quebec are concerned with the advancement of a purpose through \nthe administration of appropriated property.\n234\n The underlying principle of civil trusts is that the question of \nownership does not arise; trusts and its administration is defined by the purpose it seeks to achieve.\n235\n The \nsettlor determines the purpose (in the case of data trusts, individuals, or organizations seeking to share their \ndata). \n236\n In both civil and common law trusts, trustees owe fiduciary duties of diligence, prudence, and loyalty. \nMoreover, settlers, beneficiaries, and ‘interested persons of interest’ have the right to institute proceedings \nagainst the trustee if trustees fail to comply with their obligations.\n237\n  \n \n  \n                                                      \n229Consumer Privacy Protection Act (CPPA), 2020.  \nSee https://www.parl.ca/LegisInfo/BillDetails.aspx?Language=e&Mode=1&billId=10950130 \n230 Government of Canada,Open Government Initiative,  \nsee https://open.canada.ca/en/open-data-principles \n231 Government of Canada, Pan-Canadian Health Data Strategy,  \nsee https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/programs/pan-canadian-health-data-strategy.html \n232 Standards Council of Canada (SCC), Canadian Data Governance Standardization Collaborative (DGSC),  \nsee https://www.scc.ca/en/flagships/data-governance \n233 See Article 1375 and Article 322 (in the case of directors) of the Quebec Civil Code \nhttp://legisquebec.gouv.qc.ca/en/showdoc/cs/ccq-1991 \n234 Article 915, Civil Code of Quebec \n235  Mettarlin, D.N(1975), McGill Law Journal,The Quebec trust and the civil law.” \n236\"Sophie  Hulin  A,  “ How  can  civil  jurisdictions  support  data  trusts?  The  Quebec  Example  “  Available  at    https://datatrusts.uk/blogs/how-can-civil-law-jurisdictions-\nsupport-data-trusts-the-quebec-example \n237 Article 1290, Civil Code of Quebec. \n\n78 \n \nKey takeaways \nIn comparison with other jurisdictions, Canada’s recognition of trusts is unique, with the presence of both civil \nand common law trusts.  The Civil Code of Quebec offers flexibility to create data trusts for a wide range of \npurposes by recognising the creation of trusts for commercial and non-commercial purposes. Furthermore, \nthe absence of ownership requirements for Quebec civil trusts means that the question of ownership of data \nto represent rights over data trusts does not arise. \nHowever,  at  present,  Canadian  laws  do  not  confer  personal  data  rights  of  portability  and  erasure.  The  \nabsence of these rights poses challenges to sustain an ecosystem of data trusts that can meaningfully make \ndecisions on the personal data of individuals held by entities. Although Quebec’s recently adopted Bill-64 \nrecognises the right to portability, it will only come into force in 2024. Similarly, the proposed Digital Charter \nalso moots recognizing the right to portability and a limited right of erasure. \nFrom interactions with experts, we observed a marked push at an ecosystem level from both the public and \nprivate  sector  to  explore  different  data  stewardship  models  in  Canada.  Aside  from  Ontario’s  attempts  to  \ncreate urban data trusts, the potential for data trusts as a form of data stewardship is being investigated by \npublic and private actors across Canada.\n238\n \n5. South Africa  \n \n  \n                                                      \n238 See, https://tiess.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Data-Trusts-In-Quebec-Civil-Law-Synthesis-2.pdf \nhttps://marsdd.gitbook.io/datatrust/trusts/what-is-a-civic-digital-trust \nhttps://hello.elementai.com/rs/024-OAQ-547/images/Data_Trusts_EN_201914.pdf \nhttps://datatrusts.uk/blogs/how-can-civil-law-jurisdictions-support-data-trusts-the-quebec-example \n\n79 \n \na)   Data protection and data rights \nLike India, the right to privacy as a fundamental right is constitutionally recognised within the South African \nConstitution’s  Bill  of  Rights\n239\n.  However,  it  was  only  on  July  1st  2020,  that  the  country’s  data  protection  \nlegislation,  Protection  of  Personal  Information  Act  2013  (POPIA),  came  into  effect\n240\n.  The  POPIA  grants  \nindividuals  the  right  to  access  and  request  correction  or  erasure  of  their  personal  data.  Additionally,  \nindividuals also have the right not to be subject to decisions that are made solely on the basis of automated \nprocessing of their personal information.\n241\n. \nThe legislation also contains provisions that allow individuals to approach the data protection regulator or \ncourts where individuals feel that there has been an interference with the protection of their personal data. \nb) Data sharing frameworks  \nIn  tandem  with  its  data  protection  law  reform,  the  South  African  government  has  also  published  the  Draft  \nNational Data and Cloud Policy as a bid “to realise the socio-economic value of data through the alignment \nof  existing  policies,  legislation  and  regulation”\n242\n.  The  policy  applies  to  the  public  and  private  sector,  and  \nmakes  recommendations  on  various  issues,  ranging  from  access  to  data,  cross-border  data  transfers,  \ncompetition in the digital economy, and digital infrastructure. Seen as a response to the growing concerns of \nconcentration of data under the control of tech corporations\n243\n, through data localisation proposals, the policy \nemphasizes asserting sovereignty over data generated within the country. \nE\nqually,  there are  also  sector-specific  approaches  being  taken  to  promote  data  sharing.  One  of  the  \ninterventions of the National Digital Health Strategy for South Africa\n244\n is to enhance data use in the health \nsector  through  data  sharing  agreements  with  third  party  health information  systems.  The  digital  health  \nstrategy also prioritises the creation of an “integrated platform and architecture for health sector information \nsystems” that will provide interoperable connection with patient information systems.  \nSouth Africa follows a mixed legal system, with Roman-Dutch and English law origins, and is evidenced in \ntheir recognition of trusts.\n245\n However, like with the Indian conception, South African law does not recognise \nEnglish law’s dual ownership of the trust property.\n246\n Therefore, trust law was, therefore, codified through the \nTrust Property Control Act 1988 (TPCA)\n247\n, recognising trusts where the ownership either lies with the trustee \n(English  influence)  or  where  the  trustee  manages  assets  that  are  bequeathed  to  the  beneficiaries  (Dutch  \ninfluence).\n248\n \nThe TPCA imposes duties of care, skill and diligence, trustees duties of loyalty are specified in the statute. \nHowever, the principles governing fiduciary actions are derived from equitable principles of English law, and \nthe duty of impartiality\n249\n is implicit in the responsibilities of a trustee.\n250\n The TPCA grants courts discretion \n                                                      \n239 Section 14 of the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa,  \nsee https://www.gov.za/documents/constitution/chapter-2-bill-rights#14 \n240 Protection of Personal Information Act (POPIA) 2013,  \nsee https://popia.co.za/category/popia/ \n241 ibid. \n242Section 3(5) of the Electronic Communications Act, 2005.  \nSee https://www.gov.za/sites/default/files/gcis_document/202104/44389gon206.pdf \n243Spuy, A.(2020)“Should we nationalise data?

The absence of data portability rights and \nthe limited recognition of the right to erasure, for instance, could create barriers for trustees to advance the \ninterests  of  the  beneficiaries.  Second,  the  development  of  data  trusts  requires  clarity  on  whether  POPIA  \nallows trustees as third parties to manage individual’s rights over their personal data.  \n6. South Korea \n \n \na)   Data protection and Data rights \nAs one of the most connected jurisdictions, South Korea (Korea) was quite early in legislating comprehensive \nregulations  on  the  use  of  data.  The  regulation  of  personal  data  is  governed  by  the  Personal  Information  \nProtection Act 2011 (PIPA)\n252\n. The legislation extends to both public and private actors. In addition to the \n                                                      \n251 Section 13 of the Trust Property Control Act \n252Personal Information Protection Act, 2011.  \nSee https://www.privacy.go.kr/eng/laws_view.do?nttId=8186&imgNo=3 \n\n81 \n \nPIPA, there are sector specific laws around health, finance, and e-commerce that govern the use and sharing \nof  information  such  as  the  Act  on  Promotion  of  Information  and  Communications  Network  Utilization  and  \nInformation  Protection  2001  ('ICNA';  also  known  as  Network  Act),  and  the  Credit  Information  Use  and  \nProtection Act 2008 ('the Credit Information Act'). While the PIPA grants individuals with data rights such as \naccess, correction, erasure, it currently does not recognise data portability rights.  \nIn  2020,  the  National  Assembly  made  amendments  to  the  three  major  privacy  legislation  - the  PIPA,  the  \nICNA and the Credit Information Act -  to streamline the application of data protection laws\n253\n. While ICNA \noperates  as  a  specialised  legislation,  provisions  of  the  ICNA  pertaining  to  personal  information  were  \nsubsumed into the PIPA.  \nI\nnterestingly,  Article  38  of  PIPA  allows  individuals  to  authorise  representatives  to  file  requests  to  access,  \ncorrect, erase or suspend data processing on behalf of the individual.\n254\n  \nb) D\nata sharing frameworks  \nPolicy makers in Korea were comparatively early in identifying data sharing strategies, with most government \nprocesses digitised during the previous decade. In June 2020, through a major policy initiative, called the \nDigital New Deal, the Korean government announced several measures to strengthen its digital infrastructure \nand cloud computing and increase the convergence between 5G and AI\n255\n. One of the measures is the ‘Data \nDam’ project, which includes various methods for data standardisation, processing, and utilisation\n256\n. The \nDigital Deal also proposes to build new platforms under the ‘MyData’ initiative. These platforms aim to support \ncitizens and provide services across healthcare, public services, finance, and transportation.  \nK\norea,  through  its  data  protection  laws,  however,  attempts  to  implement  data  localisation  practices.  For  \ninstance, transferring personal information abroad requires data controllers to notify and obtain consent from \nthe data subject. Additionally, restrictions are imposed on transferring information to organisations based in \njurisdictions that have restricted the transfer of personal information abroad.  \nc)   Fiduciary obligations \nKorea codified trusts through the Korean Trust Act 1961\n257\n In 2009, after extensive deliberations by the trust \nlaw reform committee, the 1961 legislation was replaced by the Trust Act 2011\n258\n to govern private trusts. It \ndefines trusts as a legal relationship where the trustor “transfers a specific piece of property (including part \nof business or an intellectual property right) to a person who accepts the trust,... and requires the trustee to \nmanage, dispose of, operate, or develop such property or engage in other necessary conduct to fulfill the \npurpose  of  the  trust,  for  the  benefit  of  a  specific  person  or  for  a  specific  purpose,  based  on  a  confidence  \nrelation  between  the  truster  and  the  trustee”\n259\n.  The  legislation  adopts  a  broad  framing  of  property  which  \ncould allow personal rights to form the subject matter of trusts.   \nC\nhapter IV of the Trust Act codifies various duties of a trustee such as the duty of care, the duty of loyalty, \nand the duty of impartiality. Moreover, a trustee should not benefit from their position or put themselves in a \nposition having a conflict of interest. Beneficiaries have personal rights  against their trustees.\n260\n Under article \n43(3) of the Trust Act, if the trustee is found to be in breach of their duties, beneficiaries can disgorge any \nbenefits made by the trustee, irrespective of whether the trustee has caused damage to the trust property. \nSimilarly, unauthorised transfers may be rescinded, if a third-party knew or should have known the illegitimate \n                                                      \n253Stylianou, T (2020), Data Guidance, “ South Korea: National Assembly passes proposed amendments to strengthen data protection legislation”.

The PIPA is one of the few legislation that allows representatives to act on \ntheir behalf to exercise individuals rights over personal data. However, for the development of data trusts, \ndata protection laws must bring about legal certainty on whether such rights to personal data can form the \nsubject matter of these trusts. \nWhile Korea has enacted comprehensive laws to regulate data use and sharing, it currently only recognises \naccess, erasure, and correction rights. The proposed amendment to the PIPA is expected to define a new \nright  to  data  portability.  Along  with  the  proposed  PIPA  amendment,  there  have  also  been  advances  in  \nfacilitating cross-sectoral sharing and policy-based approaches to data standardisation as part of the Digital \nNew Deal. While initiatives such as MyData seek to increase the control which individuals have over their \npersonal  data,  it  remains  to  be  seen  how  it  incorporates  procedural  safeguards  and  accountability  \nmechanisms. \n7.    Australia \n \na)   Data Protection and Data Rights \nAustralia was one of the early countries that passed the Privacy Act 1988\n262\n to align with the OECD guidelines \non the Protection of Privacy and Transborder Flows of Personal Data\n263\n. It gives individuals various rights \nsuch as the right to know why personal information is being collected and to whom it will be disclosed; the \n                                                      \n261 Article 75(1) of the Trust Act 2011 \n262 Privacy Act 1988, see https://www.legislation.gov.au/Series/C2004A03712 \n263OECD (2013), “OECD Guidelines on the Protection of Privacy and Transborder Flows of Personal Data - OECD.” Available at: \n<https://www.oecd.org/sti/ieconomy/oecdguidelinesontheprotectionofprivacyandtransborderflowsofpersonaldata.htm> \n\n83 \n \nright  to  access  one’s  personal  information;  reject  unwanted  direct  marketing,  and  the  right  to  make  a  \ncomplaint.\n264\n However, there is no private right of action against data controllers available to individuals. \nThe Australian Privacy Principles (APP) form the foundation of the privacy protection framework of the Act\n265\n. \nThey apply to all entities the Act covers and governs the standards, rights and obligations around collection; \nuse  and  disclosure  of  personal  information;  the  entity’s  governance  and  accountability;  integrity  and  \ncorrection of personal information and individual’s rights to access their personal information\n266\n.   \nb) Data sharing frameworks  \nFollowing Europe and Canada, as a means to encourage data use for economic benefit, Australia released \nits first Data Strategy for 2021 to 2025\n267\n. The strategy seeks to strengthen effective, safe and secure data \nuse. Amongst other functions, the strategy will also outline the government’s frameworks surrounding data \nsharing and custodianship of both public and private data in Australia. Additionally, the government initiative \nplans to incorporate inter-agency (government) collaboration in order to promote data maturity, visibility and \ncapability  in  the  Australian  Public  Service\n268\n.  As  part  of  their  data-driven  innovation  approach,  the  Data  \nStrategy is set out to construct a framework to improve data sharing mechanisms, data access management \nand bolster participation between government and businesses. In order to achieve this, the government looks \nat the possibility of incorporating Consumer Data Right and relevant institutions to establish a data-driven \neconomy\n269\n. \nThere are some intra-jurisdiction data sharing channels in place in Australian jurisdiction at varying levels \nsuch as the Multi-Agency Data Integration Project (MADIP) which integrates datasets from five jurisdictions \n-   the  Australian  Bureau  of  Statistics;  the  Australian  Taxation  Office;  Department  of  Education,  Skill  and  \nEmployment; Department of Health; Department of Social Services and Services Australia\n270\n.   \nRecently, the Australian government tabled Data Availability and Transparency Bill 2020\n271\n and, if passed, \nwill allow greater sharing of public sector data with accredited users -  either from public or private sectors for \nthe purposes of improving government sector delivery, informing, and evaluating government policy and to \nsupport research and development. This will be permissible only if it is in accordance with the data sharing \nprinciples and governed by a data sharing agreement.\n272\n \nc)    Fi\nduciary Obligations \nIn Australia, duties owed by fiduciaries are determined as per the nature of the relationship.\n273\n However, at \nthe heart of these fiduciary relationships, the fiduciary undertakes to act on behalf of or in the interests of \nanother person.\n274\n Trusts in Australia largely follow principles of English trust law, with some variance codified \nthrough  legislation.  However,  the  fiduciary  duty  of  loyalty  and  no-conflict  are  foundational  to  these  \nrelationships.  In  Australia,  charitable  trusts  are  regulated  by  the  Australian  Charities  and  Not-for-profits \nCommission.\n275\n A charitable trust must be for a not-for-profit purpose that benefits the public. \nAustralia’s  data  sharing  frameworks  take  up  a  more  comprehensive  scope  because  of  their  robust  inter-\nsectoral data sharing mechanisms and recognition of data intermediaries through the Consumer Data Right. \n                                                      \n264See <https://www.oaic.gov.au/privacy/the-privacy-act/rights-and-responsibilities/> \n265See<https://www.oaic.gov.au/privacy/australian-privacy-principles/read-the-australian-privacy-principles/> \n266 ibid. \n267 Data and the Digital Economy, 2021.

While  Australia  has  delineated  duties  owed  by  \ntrustees towards beneficiaries, fiduciary duties are prophylactic.  \nKey takeaways \nWhile trusts in Australia primarily follow principles of English law, the absence of certain rights over personal \ndata,  such  as  portability  and  erasure  of  data,  will  restrict  data  trusts  from  managing  the  rights  of  the  \nbeneficiaries effectively. Alternatively, through the recent Consumer Data Right (CDR), the government is \ndeveloping data sharing mechanisms that recognise a form of data portability right. CDR mandates entities \nin sectors to make consumer’s data available to ease restrictions on accessing and sharing data. Consumers \ncan then decide which providers they wish to share this data with.  Currently, CDR has been implemented in \nthe banking sector and is expected to roll out gradually across the various sectors.  \nAlthough current regulations under the CDR are silent on the representation of rights by third parties, there \nis potential to recognise data trusts as a new class of intermediaries that can manage the interests of the \nusers while being bound by fiduciary obligations that are applicable to trustees. \n8. Singapore \n \na)   Data protection and Data rights \nThe  regulation  of  personal  data  and  the  rights  conferred  to  individuals  are  defined  in  the  Personal  Data  \nProtection Act (PDPA), which came into force in 2013.\n276\n In addition to the PDPA, which is the overarching \npersonal data protection law, there are other sector specific legislation like the Banking Act and the Insurance \nAct that regulate use of personal information. \nT\nhrough flexible consent mechanisms, the PDPA seeks to balance the interests of individuals and the private \nsector.\n277\n PDPA creates exemptions from requiring consent when processing \"is necessary for any purpose \n                                                      \n276 See https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/Overview-of-PDPA/The-Legislation/Personal-Data-Protection-Act> \n277 ibid. \n\n85 \n \nwhich  is  clearly  in  the  interests  of  the  individual  or  if  the  individual  would  not  reasonably  be  expected  to  \nwithhold consent.\" Additionally the PDPA confers rights to access, correction, and portability to individuals.\n278\n \nb) D\nata sharing frameworks  \nData sharing in Singapore is primarily driven by government efforts and investment in building digital capacity. \nFor  instance,  the  Digital  Government  Blueprint  -    five  year  plan  put  forward  by  Smart  Nation  and  Digital  \nGovernment  Group  - prioritises  building  open  data  platforms  which  use  open  application  programming  \ninterfaces  (APIs)  and  open  standards  for  interoperability.\n279\n  Similarly,  AI  Singapore,  a  government  wide  \npartnership, brings together research institutions  across the country to boost its AI capabilities. Additionally, \nthe programme’s Model AI Governance Framework provides guidance to the private sector organizations to \naddress  key  ethical  and  governance  issues  for  AI  related  solutions.  The  ‘Implementation  and  Self-\nAssessment  Guide’  helps  organisations  assess  the  alignment  of  their  AI  governance  practices  to  the  \nframework.\n280\n \nTo boost sharing and re-use of data in the private sector, Infocomm Development Authority and the Personal \nData Protection Commission (PDPC) introduced the Trusted Data Sharing Framework. It focuses on aspects \nthat  can  guide  commercial  and  non-governmental  sectors  to  enhance  data  sharing  within  the  ecosystem.  \nThe  framework  covers  four  aspects,  namely,  data-sharing  strategy;  legal  and  regulatory  considerations;  \ntechnical and organisation considerations; and operationalising data sharing.\n281\n  \nRegulatory  approaches  to  data  protection  have  also  attempted  to  encourage  innovation  in  emerging  \ntechnologies. This can be seen in the PDPC’s flexibility to data protection, wherein it grants exemptions -  on \na case-by-case basis -  to obligations under the PDPA for the development of new technologies.\n282\n \nc)   Fiduciary obligations \nSingapore’s legal system derives heavily from the English common law system, and therefore recognises \ncommon law conceptions of trusts and fiduciaries. While English law cases continue to hold relevance, their \nlegal system has also codified some of the common law principles of trust and equity in the Trustees Act \n(Chapter  337)\n283\n  and  the  Business  Trusts  Act.\n284\n  Singapore  views  fiduciary  duties  as  proscriptive  and  \nprophylactic, placing emphasis on the duty of loyalty and avoiding conflicts of interest.\n285\n Under Singapore \nlaw,  the  main  financial  remedies  available  to  the  beneficiary  are  equitable  compensation  and  account  of  \nprofits\n286\n.   \nUnlike traditional trusts, business trusts import corporate governance-like mechanisms in the trust structure. \nA  key  difference  is  that  the  role  of  trustees  is  replaced  by  trustee-managers,  which  must  be  registered  \ncorporations.\n287\n Although trustee-managers are not defined as fiduciary in nature, the duties are similar to \nordinary trustees. So, while trustee-managers are required to act in the best interests of all the unitholders \nas a whole, they are required to prioritise the interests of the trusts over theirs only if it \"conflicts with the \ninterests of all the unitholders as a whole\".\n288\n Like most corporate regulations, the Business Trusts Act seeks \nto  ensure  accountability  by  imposing  obligations  on  trustee-managers  to  conduct  audits  and  hold  annual  \ngeneral  meetings.  The  registration  and  functioning  of  business  trusts  is  also  regulated  by  the  Monetary  \nAuthority of Singapore. \n                                                      \n278 ibid \n279GovTech Singapore, Digital Government Blueprint.

In recent years, the discourse has also moved around data standardisation \nand recognition of data intermediaries, with the regulator encouraging data reuse for economic activity. \nThe flexibility of trusts in Singapore to engage in a wide range of activities and the recognition of rights over \ndata  such  as  access,  portability,  and  erasure  create  a  conducive  ecosystem  for  the  development  of  data  \ntrusts. The court’s jurisdiction to oversee the actions of trustees provides beneficiaries with strong safeguards \nto ensure accountability.  \n9. Kenya \n \n \na)   Data protection and Data rights \nKenya’s  framing  of  data  protection  and  the  rights  of  data  subjects  are  relatively  latent.  Regulation  of  \ninformation  processing  is  primarily  governed  by  the  Data  Protection  Act  2019,  which  was  enacted  to  \nrecognise the right to privacy guaranteed under the recently redrafted Constitution of Kenya.\n289\n  \nAmong  other  rights,  the  Data  Protection  Act  confers  data  subjects  with  the  rights  to  access,  request  \ninformation on their data processing, correction, and portability. The law also imposes restrictions on the flow \nof personal data outside its borders.  Data can only be transferred across borders if there is adequate data \nprotection safeguards or consent from the data subject. \nb) Data Sharing  \n                                                      \n289 Article 31(c) and (d)  \n\n87 \n \nOwing  to  infrastructural  barriers  and  legislative  gaps,  purpose  or  sector  specific  data  sharing  practices  in  \nKenya are not prevalent. In the public sector, the Kenyan government In 2011, launched the Kenya Open \nData  Initiative  (KODI),  as  part  of  its  commitment  - under  the-then  newly  codified  constitution  - to  provide  \ncitizens  with  access  to  information.\n290\n  Since  its  inception,  KODI  has  made  over  800+  datasets  relating  to  \ngovernment sectors such as health, education and infrastructure publicly available.\n291\n  \nc)   Fi\nduciary obligations \nGiven  Kenya’s  common  law  origins,  the  legal  system  recognises  the  operation  of  trusts.  The  Trustees  \n(Perpetual Succession Act specifies the rules regarding the incorporation of trusts for religious, educational, \nliterary, scientific, social, athletic, or charitable purposes are defined in the Trustees (Perpetual Succession) \nAct.  \nEqually,  fiduciary-like  duties,  such  as  exercising  care  and  skill  and  avoiding  conflicts  of  interest,  are  also  \nrecognised  in  agency  relationships and corporate frameworks. (directors duties).\n292\n    For  instance,  section  \n145 of the Companies Act 2015 codifies the duty of care, skill, and diligence owed by a director. Similarly, \nsection 146 of the Act requires directors to avoid situations that can lead to conflicts of interest. However, \ndirectors owe these duties to the company and not the shareholders. Courts can intervene to remove/appoint \nnew trustees or hold directors liable for breach of fiduciary duty. \nKey takeaways  \nAlthough Kenya's recently enacted data protection law recognises individuals' rights to access, correct, and \nport their data, weak digital infrastructures and regulatory capacity have stultified discourse at an ecosystem \nlevel on the potential to steward data.  Naturally, restrictions on access and availability of data have a bearing \non data trusts and other data stewardship models to represent the interests of beneficiaries. In recent times, \ncivil society organisations, such as the Open Institute, have been focusing their efforts on creating awareness \nand building networks to communicate the data rights afforded to individuals. \nIn  addition  to  the  considerations  on  the  representation  of  data  rights  within  trust  structures,  it  is  equally  \nimportant  to  investigate  the  general  acceptance  of  trusts  within  the  jurisdiction’s  legal  culture.  Like  South  \nAfrica,  Kenya  has  a  perceptible  reliance  on  corporate  frameworks  like  companies  and  agencies  and  is  \nreflected in the manner in which company law has evolved in Kenya.  \n \n \n \n                                                      \n290 See https://www.centreforpublicimpact.org/case-study/open-data-kenya \n291 See https://www.opendata.go.ke/ \n292 Sections 145 and 146 of the Companies Act 2015 Available at \nhttp://kenyalaw.org/kl/fileadmin/pdfdownloads/Acts/2015/TheCompaniesAct_No17of2015_RevisedCompressed.pdf \n\n88 \n \n10. Brazil  \n \na)   Data protection and Data rights  \nAlthough  Brazil  has  various  sectoral  privacy  laws  in  place,  the  enactment  of  the  General  Personal  Data  \nProtection Law (LGPD) was Brazil’s first attempt at a comprehensive GDPR-like regulation of personal data. \nThe  LGPD  derives  heavily  from  the  principles  defined  in  the  GDPR,  especially  with  regard  to  the  scope,  \nterritorial application and obligations under the law. Like with GDPR, anonymised data falls outside the ambit \nof regulation.  \nThe legislation grants rights such as access to data, rectification, portability, opposition to treatment, right to \ninformation and explanation about the use of data. Interestingly, Article 40 of the LGPD gives the national \ndata protection authority powers to prescribe standards for interoperability for portability. This may allow  \nb) Data Sharing  \nBrazil was one of the founding members of the Open Government Partnership 2011, which sought to promote \ntransparency and availability of resources through the use of Information and Communication Technology.\n293\n \nThe  technical  standards  and  standardisation  of  formats  are  overseen  by  the  National  Open  Data  \nInfrastructure.\n294\n However, purpose led data sharing in Brazil is still latent, with limited policy articulation of \ninteroperability standards. \n                                                      \n293 C. Bittencourt, J. Estima and G. Pestana (2019),14th Iberian Conference on Information Systems and Technologies (CISTI), \"Open Data Initiatives in Brazil\", doi: \n10.23919/CISTI.2019.8760592 \n294   See   https://cnae.ibge.gov.br/en/estrutura/natjur-estrutura/natureza-juridica-2003-1/1861-novo-portal/institucional/8814-infraestrutura-nacional-de-dados-abertos-\ninda-2.html \n\n89 \n \nIn the financial sector, the Brazilian Central Bank is in the process of increasing the flow of data in the banking \nsector  through  application  programming  interfaces  (APIs)  that  will  give  third-party  developers  access  to  \nconsumer transaction data to build applications and services around the participating financial institutions.\n295\n \nc)   Fi\nduciary obligations \nAs a civil legal system, Brazilian law does not recognise trusts. While the conception of fiduciary law is largely \nabsent,  duties  like  care  and  diligence  are  imposed  on  directors -   which  they  owe  towards  the  company  - \nthrough the Brazilian Corporation Law.\n296\n  There are other legal entities like foundations and associations \nthat allow the collective administration of assets for charitable purposes. Associations can be formed by two \nor more persons for non-profit purposes. An association’s Articles of Organization describe its purpose,  rules \naround the admission and dismissal of the association members, and manner in which board/management \nfunctions.  \nW\nhile associations can be  constituted  for  any  purpose,  foundations  are  required  to  have  a  public  interest  \nelement. Like charities, foundations could be public or private, and are created for specific purposes of public \ninterest  by  way  of  an  endowment.\n297\n  The  Brazilian  Civil  Code  lists  different  areas  for  which  they  can  be  \nestablished. For private foundations, accountability is maintained through oversight powers of the Attorney \nGeneral's  Office.\n298\n  Public  foundations  are  created  by  the  government  through  legislation  to  undertake  \nactivities  that  do  not  ordinarily  fall  within  the  government’s  remit.  However,  in  both  these  structures,  it  is  \nunclear how data (or the rights over it) could be managed and if fiduciary-like obligations exist within it. Both \nfoundations and associations require members to forgo proprietary interests over the assets (data/data rights \nin the case of data trusts). \n \nKey takeaways \nBrazil’s enactment of the LGPD in 2018 culminated in a decade-long movement involving participation from \nacademia, civil society, and the private sector.\n299\n Like GDPR, the Brazilian law recognises rights such as \naccess,  portability,  and  deletion,  which  are  necessary  for  data  intermediaries  to  manage  the  interests  of  \nindividuals.  \nH\nowever, like most jurisdictions that have recently enacted a data protection law, the limited discourse at a \ngrassroots  level  on  the  rights  available  to  individuals  over  their  personal  data  has  meant  that  regulators'  \nefforts  have  been  concentrated  on  creating  awareness  and  ensuring  compliance  with  the  law.\n300\n  For \ninstance,  in  a  survey  conducted  in  September  2020  by  a  Brazilian  credit  intelligence  company,  70%  of  \nrespondents were unaware of the LGPD.\n301\n  \nDeveloping a data governance approach that relies on the trust framework in the absence of common law \ntrust-like structures  will  prove  challenging.  Conceptualising  data  trusts  require  legislative  intervention  that  \nallows for collectivised representation and management of rights over data with avenues to hold trustees or \nmanagers accountable. \n \n                                                      \n295 Mari,A (2019) “ Brazil ushers in open banking model “ Available at https://www.zdnet.com/article/brazil-ushers-in-open-banking-model/ \n296 Article 153 of the Brazilian Corporation law http://conteudo.cvm.gov.br/export/sites/cvm/subportal_ingles/menu/investors/anexos/Law-6.404-ing.pdf \n297 See http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/leis/l7596.htm \n298 Civil Code Article 66  \n299 See https://www.observatorioprivacidade.com.br/en/memoria/2018-an-astral-conjunction-2/  \n300 Mari,A (2021) “ Brazilian government launches data protection campaign “ Available at  https://www.zdnet.com/article/brazilian-government-launches-data-protection-\ncampaign/ \n301 Mari, A (2020) “ Brazilians mostly unaware of data protection regulations” Available at https://www.zdnet.com/article/brazilians-mostly-unaware-of-data-protection-\nregulations/ \n\n90 \n \n11. Ghana \n \na)   Data Protection and Data Rights \nIn Ghana, data protection is primarily governed through the Data Protection Act, 2012.\n302\n In addition to this, \nthere  are  other  laws  such  as  the  Electronic  Communications  Act,  2008,  Electronic  Communications  \nRegulations,  2011  and  the  Credit  Reporting  Act,  2007  which  have  provisions  on  the  use  of  data.  In  \ncomparison  to  other  countries,  Ghana’s  Data  Protection  Act  is  comparatively  narrow  in  its  scope.  Data  \nsubjects have the right to access and correct their personal data, and object to processing of their personal \ndata.  While  there  are  no  data  localisation  laws  in  place,  Ghana’s  data  protection  laws  mandate  data  \ncontrollers and processors in Ghana to apply foreign countries’ data protection laws when processing foreign \ncitizens’ personal data.  \nb) D\nata sharing frameworks  \nWhile Ghana sees an absence of policy and legislative articulation on data sharing, there are some instances \nof public-private sector collaboration for data sharing. For instance, in 2018, Ghana Statistical Service (GSS), \nVodafone  Ghana,  and  Flowminder  signed  a  data  sharing  agreement  to  formulate  public  health  and  \nsustainable  development  policies  by  drawing  insights  from  mobile  phone  data.\n303\n  Pseudonymised  and  \naggregated data was shared with GSS with limitations on use. The collaboration has continued during the \npandemic to assess the effectiveness of COVID-19 restrictions by providing insights upon internal migration, \naggregated  mobility  patterns  and  reductions  in  movement  during  the  pandemic\n304\n.  With  the  public  sector  \nfacing  constraints  in  the  availability  of  good  datasets,  such  collaborations  with  private  technology  \ncorporations allow decision makers access to data that can be leveraged to create targeted policies.  \n                                                      \n302  See https://cybersecurity.gov.gh/documents/Data_Protection_Act_2012.pdf \n303See https://www.unsdsn.org/post-title61e7c848  \n304Seehttps://static1.squarespace.com/static/5b4f63e14eddec374f416232/t/5ef206529723f531491dceb0/1592919639048/Ghana+Case+Study_FINAL.pdf  \n\n91 \n \nc)   Fiduciary obligations \nIn  Ghana,  fiduciary  obligations  and  relationships  are  most  clearly  located  in  duties  owed  by  directors  of  \ncompanies. The recently enacted Companies Act, 2019 holds that directors stand in a fiduciary relationship \ntowards the company. Directors must act in the best interests of the company, and promote the purposes of \nthe company with good faith, diligence and care.\n305\n  \nSuch a model for data trusts would require creating a corporate structure where the company has contractual \narrangements with each data provider, who act in their capacity as shareholders of the company. The data \ntransferred to the company would be managed by the directors bound by duties recognised in the Companies \nAct.\n306\n Under the Companies Act, shareholders have the power to bring derivative action against the director \nfor any breach of breach of fiduciary responsibilities.\n307\n \nKey takeaways \nThe recognition of rights in Ghana’s data protection law and the established administrative and legal recourse \nmechanisms  against  data  controllers  make  the  country’s  data  protection  and  data  rights  ambit  more  \noptimistic. Further, interactions with experts reflected a strong political will to realise the value of data, as well \nas a great degree of cooperation between policymakers, regulators and the private sector. However, lack of \nlucid data standardisation policies, combined with a dearth of sectoral data sharing without clear purpose do \nnot fare well for Ghana’s data sharing frameworks. In building Ghanian data regimes, a lack of capital has \nalso hampered on-ground advocacy and implementation of such rights. The adoption and reliance on trusts \nto  administer  assets  are  unclear.  On  the  contrary,  the  Companies  Act  imposes  fiduciary  duties  on  the  \ndirectors of the company. However, these duties are owed towards the company and not the shareholders. \n \n \n  \n                                                      \n305 Section 190 of the Companies Act, 2019, Available at https://rgd.gov.gh/docs/Act%20992.pdf \n306 See https://theodi.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/General-legal-report-on-data-trust.pdf \n307 Section 201 of the Companies Act, 2019 \n\n92 \n \nSECTION 4 \nThe final section presents the takeaways and insights from our comparative analysis of the \njurisdictions, identifying the various challenges and uncertainties in the current ecosystem \nto develop data trusts. The latter part of the section also outlines areas that are not within \nthe  report's  scope  but  merit  further  research  and  exploration.  Important  takeaways  and  \ninsights from the section include: \n●   The  articulation  of  data  rights  and  data  sharing  frameworks  varied  significantly  \nacross different jurisdictions. This was due to a range of factors such as economic \nand political constraints, lack of political will, and disparity in digital infrastructures. \n●   While  certain  jurisdictions  like  the  EU,  UK,  and  Brazil  had  robust  recognition  of  \npersonal  data  rights,  many  of  them  lacked  the  range  of  rights  - such  as  access,  \nportability, and erasure -  required for the operation of data trusts. Even in jurisdictions \nthat did recognise them, there were limitations to its exercise.  \n●   Through expert interviews, it was observed that even in jurisdictions where there was \nlegislative recognition of rights and concepts, the ground reality was quite different. \nSo,  while  certain  jurisdictions  recognise  trusts  and  have  enacted  comprehensive  \ndata protection laws, the actual adoption and implementation might vary significantly. \n4.1 Insights and recommendations from comparative analysis \n \n \nOur  analysis  throws  up  several  key  insights  that  demonstrate  disparity  in  maturity  of  legal  landscapes  for  \ndata  trusts  around  the  globe,  and  point  to  the  need  for  administrative  and  legislative  investments  in  data  \n\n93 \n \ngovernance  in  several  countries.  Further,  it  was  found  that  for  legal  systems  which  don’t  embed  fiduciary  \nduties matching common law structures, there may be a need to explore diverse structures of human-centric \ndata governance. \nDisparity across nations and the lack of digital infrastructure \nGiven the diversity -  both economic and political -  of the jurisdictions analysed we found that the maturity in \narticulating  rights  over  data  varied significantly.  This  was  partly  due  to  varied  priorities  for  different  \njurisdictions, economic and political constraints, or the lack of political will to articulate these rights. When \nevaluating   data-sharing   policies,   it   is   clear   that   the   robustness   of   digital   and   technical   pathways   \ninfrastructures plays a vital part. This includes regulatory measures like standardisation of data formats or \nsharing  purpose,  enabling  interoperability,  or  introducing  digital  public  infrastructure.  For  developing  \ncountries, the absence of data sharing policies is often a function of digitisation capacity. Many countries rely \non international technology companies to set up this infrastructure, which often comes with restrictions on \nhow governments can share or use this generated data. \nThus, the legal analysis must be read in cognisance of the fact  that developed countries such as those in \nthe European Union have, over the years, been able to take  advantage of their economic wealth and social \nawareness  to  prioritise  sturdy  digital  infrastructures.  Therefore,  the  discourse  and  ecosystem  around  \nregulation of technologies, data protection and data rights is much more robust and it is unsurprising that a \nprogressive and foundational regulation such as the GDPR has emerged out of the EU. Similarly, countries \nsuch as Australia, Canada, Singapore are also making advances on data protection.  \nIn  most  of  the  developing  world,  digital  ecosystems  are  defined  by  infrastructure  created  by  western  \ntechnology corporations. While this influence has enabled these jurisdictions to streamline governance and \nimprove  access  to  digitised  financial  services,  they  are  prevented  from  deriving  full  value  from  the  data  \ngenerated. Countries like Kenya, India, and South Africa have started responding to some of these concerns \nby framing data localisation laws and policies, applying the lens of ‘data sovereignty’. However, this demands \ndurable,  low-friction  digital  infrastructure  that  can  responsibly  collect  and  process  large  amounts  of  data.  \nGiven  these  tensions,  it  is  often  quite  difficult  for  governments  to  strike  a  balance  between  regulation,  \nprotectionism and liberalization.    \nPersonal data rights and building for autonomy \nEven within some of the countries with more robust digital infrastructures, the absence  of certain personal \ndata rights -  such as access, portability and erasure -  pose challenges in creating a sustainable data trust \necosystem. For instance, Canada, Australia, and South Korea, while faring well on digital infrastructure, have \nyet to recognise clear data portability rights. It was found that in order to enable data trusts in a streamlined \necosystem -   infrastructure  alone  cannot  carry  the  torch,  and  personal  data  rights  must  mature  to  enable  \ngreater  individual  autonomy.  This  also  entails  exploration  of  novel  ways  in  which  individuals  can  exercise  \ntheir rights over data which, in turn, may allow means for collective governance (for example, with the ability \nto pool data). \nOn  the  other  hand,  while  some  developing  countries  fared  better  in  recognising  these  rights,  through  \nconversations with multiple experts (which have helped contextualise this work) it was found that there is \noften  a  dissonance  between  the  provisions  of  legislation  and  its  actual  enforcement.  For  instance,  in  a  \nNovember 2020 survey conducted by the Brazilian Association of Software Companies (ABES) and EY, it \nwas  observed  that  nearly  60%  of  the  corporations  in  the  technology  sector  were  yet  to  comply  with  the  \nprovisions of the LGPD. Thus, for most of these nations, there is a need to not only enable a fertile legal \nlandscape for data trusts, but to build capacity, awareness and process-oriented enforcement. \nIn order to map individual data rights to the trust structure, a certain level of mandatability or transference of \nrights is necessitated. In order for a trustee to manage a subject's data, there must be clear legal outlines as \nto what level of an individual's autonomy over their data can come within the ambit of third party delegation. \nConsequently,  the  aim  of  fiduciary  relationships  is  partly  to  protect  beneficiaries  and  guard  against  the  \nresultant power dynamic between beneficiary and trustee. However, such a transference - which enables \ntrustees to exercise data rights on behalf of the beneficiary -  is an incredibly delicate and contentious legal \nspace, and there is a need to guard against paternalistic structures that delegation of data rights may enable. \n\n94 \n \nLegislative implementation and regulatory oversight  \nThe marked variance in legislative process and the implementation of laws has been a recurring feature in \nthis analysis. Legal concepts that are common across jurisdictions are not always implemented uniformly. \nFor instance, the extent of adoption of trusts in Kenya and South Africa -  countries with common law origins \n- is not as crystalised as compared to jurisdictions such as England, which extensively use trusts for a variety \nof commercial and non-commercial purposes. Therefore, the feasibility of trusts remains an underdeveloped \nand underexplored area of law.  \nAlthough charitable  trusts  in  the  UK  and  Australia,  and  business  trusts  in  Singapore  have  established  \nregulatory regimes, a common thread across most jurisdictions was the absence of institutionalised oversight \nmechanisms  that  can  regulate  data  trusts.  Regulatory  authorities  can  incorporate  flexible  methods  to  \nnavigate challenges while giving legitimacy and certainty to the activities of data trusts. Ex-ante and ex-post \nregulatory powers also ensure accountability and are invaluable in jurisdictions where court processes are \ncostly. Unlike legislative approaches, which are typically binding and slow to change, regulators can adopt \nmore participatory practices that reflect the concerns of stakeholders from the private sector, academia, and \ncivil society.  \nThe  success of  the  regulator  will  depend  on  how  it  contextualises  its  approach.  Considering  the  nascent  \nstage at which data trusts are in practice, regulators must play a much more proactive and reflexive role in \ncreating awareness, engaging different stakeholders in the ecosystem, and guarding against regulatory and \necosystem capture. However, any such approach will require investments in building regulatory capacity.  \nA ‘data trust conundrum’ for stewardship \nIt is evident that the conception of data trusts is most fundamentally rooted in English trust law. Based on \nthis analysis, even in jurisdictions that have common law influence and recognise trusts, the evolution of its \nconcepts have not mirrored the English experience. This is even more the case when considering gaps and \nuncertainties  around  the  ability  for  data  rights  to  form  the  subject  matter  of  trusts.  In  some  of  the  \ncommonwealth jurisdictions, the codification of trusts may have restricted its scope.\n308\n \nT\nhe case studies chronicled in Output 1 (Data Trust Survey) showcase a diversity of initiatives that empower \ncommunities and individuals to steward data. These case studies highlight the bottom-up approach and show \ndifferences in structures such as MIDATA and Driver’s Seat are data co-operatives; they focus on community \nempowerment and managing data use with data generators participation. Further, Output 1 also presents a \nresult  of  a  survey  targeting  practitioners  who  are  building  trusts  and  how  these  initiatives  have  identified  \nthemselves  and  their  approach.  The survey  lays  down  6  functions  of  data  trusts  as  per  GPAI  definition.  \nRespondents who performed all 6 functions were either not active or preferred not to be called data trusts. \nLegal barriers such as clarity on data rights of citizens,variation of data rights across different jurisdictions or  \neven  having  an  operative  data  protection  legislation  in  the  first  place,  and  the  ambiguity  in  recognition  of  \ntrusts and whether trusts can hold data (or rights over it) could be the reason why initiatives fail to meet the \nconception of data trusts. \nGiven this, our analysis has attempted to locate functionally equivalent provisions in these jurisdictions. By \nidentifying, for instance, fiduciary-like duties and the scope for similar judicial interventions that are contained \nin trust structures. Yet this application has not been a straightforward exercise. For instance, while civil legal \nsystems such as Germany recognise higher standards of care and good faith in contractual obligations when \ncompared with common law systems, it is still not feasible to draw parallels with the fiduciary relationship \nbetween  a  trustee  and  beneficiary  where  the  scope  of  remedies  available  are  very  different.  These  \ncomplexities have raised a keen awareness that the trust structure may not be one that can be resurrected \nin a uniform manner across most legal systems.  \nHowever, as we work toward the goal of enabling value oriented, human-centric data governance, there is \npromise in a number of jurisdictions (based on their performance across the key legal enablers) to develop \ntrust-like  structures  and  alternate  models  of  data  stewardship.  In  regions  like  Singapore,  Canada,  South  \nKorea or Germany, for example, there is favourable alignment across the analysis framework and while it \nmay  be  arduous  to  build  data  trusts  in  particular,  there  is  certainly  potential  to  broaden  the  horizon  of  \n                                                      \n308 Refer to box ‘Can data rights form the subject matter of trusts across jurisdictions’ \n\n95 \n \nstewardship  to  models  like  data  cooperatives,  data  exchanges,  collaboratives  or  others.  It  is  important  to  \nguard against a pigeonhole of stewardship that foregrounds data trusts even in regions where other modes \nof  governance  can  minimise  legislative  overhaul  and  friction,  while  still  working  to  maximise  participation,  \nagency and value.  \nThus,  it  is  critical  to  note  that  the  analysis  reflects  legal  fertility  for  only  data  trusts  as  defined  in  \naforementioned sections\n309\n, and the outcomes or levels depicted must not be confused to be a decree on \nthe overall robustness of a region's data regime. Many of the jurisdictions captured are better suited to other \nmodels of data stewardship, and there is a need to amplify discourse, tests and enable human centric data \ngovernance in ways that play to the strengths of various legal systems. And for many, these strengths are \nnot most ideally captured by trust law. \n4.2 Scope of the research -  open questions  \nWhile  this  analysis  has  encompassed  the  legal  necessities,  status  and  challenges  in  implementing  data  \ntrusts, there are a number of limitations that feature beyond the scope of this review, and are yet pertinent in \nthe exploration of data trusts and other human centric forms of data governance.  \nWhile the framing of personal data rights has individuals at its focal point, an area that merits exploration is \nthe consequence of collectivising these rights under trusts. A critical question that needs to be addressed is \nhow regulations propose to balance collective interests and individuals' interests. Equally, what avenues for \nrecourse  will  aggrieved  minority  groups  in  a  data  trust  have,  and  how  can  personal  data  rights  be  \ndisaggregated from the collectivised rights and interests? \nIntellectual  property  rights  (IPR)  claims  over  data  held  by  organisations  can  also  create  barriers  to  the  \nportability of data to data trusts, specifically in the case of inferred data, which is not provided by the data \ngenerator. While the tensions between IPR and data protection laws currently curtail individuals’ right to port \ninferred  data,  the  possibility  of  collective  data  rights  -   as  articulated  in  India  for  non-personal  data  - over \naggregated data and the role of data trusts to negotiate these tensions needs to be evaluated.  \nDiscussions in Europe -  under the proposed Data Act -  and the U.S. on the framing of co-generated rights \nalso pose new questions on the possibility of data trusts to hold co-generated data.\n310\n The feasibility for data \ntrusts to hold these data rights will depend on how co-generated rights are framed, and extent to which data \ngenerators are granted rights over, for instance, the portability rights afforded to them.  \nA\nt a foundational level, trusts offer an institutional framework for data trusts to operate. The nature of a trust's \nfunctions will depend on its governance structure and the interests that individual data trusts wish to achieve. \nBuilding  a  plurality  of  data  trusts  that  pursue  diverse  interests,  among  other  factors,  depends  on  the  \narticulation of revenue models.  It is vital to explore incentivisation structures that can foster trustees to pursue \ntheir beneficiaries' interests proactively.  \n \n \n \n \n                                                      \n309 Data    Governance    Working    Group    (2021),    Global    Partnership    for    Artificial    Intelligence,    “Understanding    data    trusts”,    https://ceimia.org/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2021/07/2021-07-09-GPAI-summary-understanding-data-trusts-updated.docx.pdf \n310 See https://www.europeanlawinstitute.eu/projects-publications/completed-projects-old/data-economy/ \n\n96 \n \nSECTION 5 \n5.1 About Aapti Institute, and GPAI \nAapti  Institute is  a  public  research  firm  that  works  at  the  intersection  of  technology  and  society,  building  \npolicy-relevant and actionable insights on the digital economy.
