What licence should you use? How can\nyou indicate the licence that a dataset is available under? This guide\nanswers these questions\nLeigh Dodds\nFormer ODI staff member: Director of Delivery\nAt its simplest, open data requires just two things: data and openness. There are\nlots of aspects to openness, but at its most fundamental, the key is how the data is\nlicensed. Data that doesn’t explicitly have an open licence is not open data.\nBut what does it mean to license data? What licence should you use? How can you\nindicate the licence that a dataset is available under? This guide answers these\nquestions.\nNote: This guide focuses on data published by organisations based in the UK.\nLicensing law is different in different countries, so some of this information might\nnot apply to you if you are based elsewhere. It does not address other potential\nlegal considerations, such as compliance with the Data Protection Act.\nWhat is licensing?\nWhen you put care and thought into creating something, such as writing a blog post\nor taking a photograph, you own that work and you have certain rights, described\nbelow.\nIf you have ownership of a work, and someone else wants to use it, they have to\nask your permission. Licences are how you explicitly give someone else\npermission to use that work.\nYou can transfer that ownership, which means that someone else now owns your\nwork and has the rights associated with it. Usually your employment contract will\nstate that work that you do as part of your employment is automatically transferred\nto your organisationfor example\nKnowledge & opinion > Guides >\n\n27/10/2022, 14:08Publisher’s Guide to Open Data Licensing – The ODI\nhttps://theodi.org/article/publishers-guide-to-open-data-licensing/2/8\nto your organisation, for example.\nYou can also waive your rights, which places the work into the public domain and\nmeans anyone can do whatever they want with it.\nWhat do you own?\nIn Europe, there are two kinds of rights that you are automatically given over things\nthat you have created:\nyou get copyright over works (content) that you create and which are original\nto you, such as text that you write or photographs you take\nyou get a database right over collections of data that you have put a\nsubstantial effort into obtaining, verifying or presenting\nNote: As far as we know the database right only arises within the European Union\nand in Mexico. In some countries there may be no protection for collections of data.\nIf you apply original judgement in putting together a database, for example in\nchoosing which items to include within the database or which information about\nthem to include, you have a copyright over that database, because it is a creative\nwork.\nFor example, if you were to build a database about the best 100 cars, this might\ninvolve:\nchoosing which cars count as the best cars\nwriting a description about each car\nresearching and gathering facts about them\nYou would have copyright over the database, because you chose which cars were\n“best”. You would have copyright over the descriptions, because you wrote them.\nAnd you would probably have the database right for the database you’ve built,\nbecause you put substantial effort into gathering information about them.\nImportantly, you don’t own the facts about the cars — anyone else can build their\nown database containing exactly those facts without violating your database right\n— but no one else can reuse your database or your descriptions without your\npermission because you own the copyright over them.\nYou probably do not have a database right if you create the facts in a database, as\nopposed to gathering them from elsewhere, unless you put substantial effort into\nverifying or presenting the database. For example, if you own a restaurant and\ncreate a database of the dishes that you offer and when you offer them, you\nprobably do not have a database right over that database, though you might have\ncopyright because of the creative judgement involved in working out which dishes\nshould be offered on particular days to provide a balanced menu.\nCopyright and database right are types of Intellectual Property Rights (IPR). There\nare other kinds of IPR that you can get, such as patents, trademarks and (some)\ndesign rights, which must be registered (for example with the Intellectual Property\n\n27/10/2022, 14:08Publisher’s Guide to Open Data Licensing – The ODI\nhttps://theodi.org/article/publishers-guide-to-open-data-licensing/3/8\ndesign rights, which must be registered (for example with the Intellectual Property\nOffice).\nWhat about data from other organisations?\nYou might not own all the content or data that you have and use within your\norganisation. In particular, rather than creating the content or gathering the data\nyourself, some of the content and data you hold and use within your organisation,\nand might want to publish, might be:\ncompletely licensed from someone else\ninclude an extract of content or data that you have licensed from someone else\nbe derived from the content or data that you have licensed from someone else\nThe reuser’s guide to open data licensing describes what you can do with content\nor data that you licence from someone else. If you do reuse that content or data in\nyour own publications, you should indicate the licence under which you are reusing\nthat content, so that people reusing that content or data know what they can do\nwith it.\nWhat about my brand?\nOrganisations who publish content or data under an open licence are often\nconcerned that this might enable reusers to also copy their brand.\nYour brand should be protected through a trade mark. A trade mark restricts how\nother people use your logo or company name. You will also have copyright on the\nlogo.\nAlthough your trade mark will protect you from other people using your logo directly,\nif your logo is incorporated into some content that you licence, you should make\nsure the logo is explicitly not covered by that licence, as you will usually want to\nplace additional restrictions on its use (such as its adaptation).\nFor example, if you have written a report that includes your logo, and you want to\nlicence the content of the report under the Creative Commons Attribution licence,\nyou could say:\nWhat if I publish the data on a website?\nY   ill h   i hd  bdhbli h h\nThe text, fig ures and tables in this report are licensed\nunder a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International\nLicense. Logos and other trade marks are not covered by\nthis licence.\n“\n”\n\n27/10/2022, 14:08Publisher’s Guide to Open Data Licensing – The ODI\nhttps://theodi.org/article/publishers-guide-to-open-data-licensing/4/8\nYou still have rights over your database and your content when you publish them\non a website. Others cannot legally extract and reuse a substantial portion of your\ndata or content without your permission.\nYou can also indicate that others should not scrape data from your website through\nyour Terms and Conditions and through technical mechanisms such\nas robots.txt.\nWhat are open licences?\nAn open licence is one that places very few restrictions on what anyone can do\nwith the content or data that is being licensed. An open licence allows others to do\nthings like:\nrepublish the content or data on their own website\nderive new content or data from yours\nmake money by selling products that use your content or data\nrepublish the content or data while charging a fee for access\nAccording to the open definition, there are only two kinds of restrictions that an\nopen licence can place:\nthat reusers must give attribution to the source of the content or data\nthat reusers must publish any derived content or data under the same licence\n(this is called share-alike)\nAn open licence might do neither or one or both of these, and you can choose\nwhich open licence to use when you publish open content or data. So, you can\nchoose to make your content or data available under one of three levels of licence:\n1. a public domain licence has no restrictions at all (technically, these indicate\nthat you waive your rights to the content or data)\n2. an attribution licence just says that reusers must give attribution to you\n3. an attribution & share-alike licence says that reusers must give attribution\nand share any derived content or data under the same licence\nWhat open licences are there?\nThere are two sets of open licences. You should use a licence from one of these\nsets rather than creating your own licence, for three reasons:\n1. it’s less work\n2. it ensures that the legal language in the licence is correct\n3. it makes it a lot easier for reusers to know what they can do with your data\nOpen licences for creative content\nCreative content, such as text, photographs, slides and so on, should be licensed\nusing a Creative Commons Licence. There are three of these that you should\nidi  f\n\n27/10/2022, 14:08Publisher’s Guide to Open Data Licensing – The ODI\nhttps://theodi.org/article/publishers-guide-to-open-data-licensing/5/8\nconsider using for open content:\nLevel of LicenceCreative Commons Licence\npublic domainCC0\nattributionCC-by\nattribution & share-alikeCC-by-sa\nMake sure that you use the latest (version 4.0) Creative Commons licences, which\nare international. The links in the table above go to the correct licences.\nThere are other types of Creative Commons licences that are not open licences.\nFor example, the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial licence does not\nallow commercial reuse of content, and therefore is not an open licence. If you use\nthe Creative Commons licence chooser, only those that are described as “Free\nCulture” licences are open licences.\nOpen licences for databases\nWe now recommend that you also use a Creative Commons 4.0 licence for data as\nwell as for content.\nYou may alternatively use a similar set of licences that was created specifically for\ndatabases from the Open Data Commons. There are again three levels that you\ncan choose from:\nLevel of LicenceOpen Data Commons Licence\npublic domainPDDL\nattributionODC-by\nattribution & share-alikeODbL\nOther Licences\nOther licences that support reuse, which you might consider using, are:\nthe UK Open Government Licence is an attribution licence that covers both\ncopyright and database right which is mainly useful for the UK public sector\nWhich licence should I use?\nThe licence that you use should support your open data business model. It is\nunusual for organisations to place content or data in the public domain as being\ngiven attribution for the content or data usually helps to achieve some of the goals\nof opening it up.\nIt is possible to license content or data under more than one licence, and let\nreusers choose which licence to use it under. Typically you would dual-\nlicense some content or data by making it available under an open\nlicence and under a paid-for licence that does not have the same restrictions. Dual-\nlicensingis typicallyused with a share alike licenceas outlinedbelow\n\n27/10/2022, 14:08Publisher’s Guide to Open Data Licensing – The ODI\nhttps://theodi.org/article/publishers-guide-to-open-data-licensing/6/8\nlicensing is typically used with a share-alike licence, as outlined below.\nSome open data business models work best with a share-alike licence. For\nexample:\na share-alike licence will usually be unattractive to commercial businesses who\ndon’t want to open up their own data, so using a share-alike licence coupled\nwith a charged licence can be a good basis for a freemium business model\nwhen you are collaborating with others to create a shared resource, a share-\nalike licence can help to ensure that you can bring back into that resource any\nwork that others do on their own copies\nOn the other hand, if you are hoping to gain other benefits for your business\nthrough the reuse of your data, using a cross-subsidy business model, you may\nfind that a share-alike licence prevents people from reusing it, and therefore want to\navoid having a share-alike restriction.\nThere are two cases where you have no choice over what licence you can use for\nthe content or data that you publish.\n1. If you are publishing content or data that is derived from content or data that\nwas licenced to you using a share-alike licence, then you must publish your\ncontent or data using that same licence.\n2. With very few exceptions, if you are a government department or arms-length\nbody then the content or data that you have created or gathered is owned by\nthe Crown. Unless you have an exemption, granted by the Office of Public\nSector Information (OPSI), you must publish this data using the Open\nGovernment Licence.\nWhat attribution should I ask for?\nIf you choose a licence that includes a requirement for attribution, you need to\nspecify what that attribution should look like.\nIn choosing what attribution to ask for, you should consider the ways in which your\ndata or content might be reused, and the fact that it might be combined with other\ndata or content that might require its own attribution. If you want to encourage the\nreuse of your data or content, you need to make it easy for reusers to satisfy your\nattribution requirements.\nThere are two things you should document:\n1. What should the attribution include? You will usually want the name of your\norganisation, and a link to either your organisation’s home page or a page\nabout the data or content you are licensing. Keep this as minimal as possible.\n2. Where and how should the attribution be presented? Some attribution\nrequirements specify that the attribution must be presented directly wherever\nthe data is used, and may even specify the size or format of the attribution.\nThese requirements can be difficult to adhere to, particularly for mobile\n\n27/10/2022, 14:08Publisher’s Guide to Open Data Licensing – The ODI\nhttps://theodi.org/article/publishers-guide-to-open-data-licensing/7/8\napplication developers who have limited screen space to include such\nattributions. Allowing reusers to provide attribution on a separate page makes\nthis easier.\nNote that under the terms of the licences listed above, when a reuser uses your\ndata or content to add value to or to create new data or content, they cannot\nrelicense your work. Any onward reusers are bound by the same attribution\nrequirements as the direct reusers of your content or data. It’s a good idea to\nexplicitly document this requirement because it might not be obvious to reusers.\nHow do I indicate the licence of content or data?\nYou should indicate the licence for content or data you make available using both a\nhuman-readable description and computer-readable metadata. The clearer you\nmake it which licence applies to your content or data, the easier it is for reusers to\nknow that they can reuse the content or data you are licensing.\nThe human-readable descriptions and marks that you should use are spelled out\non the Creative Commons and Open Data Commons websites:\nCreative Commons licence chooser\nOpen Data Commons licences\nIt is best to embed information about the licence that some content or data is\navailable under directly within the content or data. This ensures that the licensing\ninformation is carried around with the content or data.\nIn addition to human-readable text, you should provide computer-readable\nmetadata. The separate Publisher’s Guide to the Open Data Rights Statement\nVocabulary describes how to do this.\nIf you add your dataset to a catalog, such as data.gov.uk or the Data Hub, you\nshould make sure that you indicate the licence under which the dataset is available\nwithin that catalog. This gives people searching the catalog a quick and easy way\nof seeing that they will be able to reuse the dataset.\nFurther reading\nOpen data commons licensing FAQ\nAcknowledgements\nVery many thanks to Francis Davey, Leigh Dodds, Tony Hirst, and the anonymous\ncommenters who contributed comments on this draft.\n\n27/10/2022, 14:08Publisher’s Guide to Open Data Licensing – The ODI\nhttps://theodi.org/article/publishers-guide-to-open-data-licensing/8/8\n      \nCreative Commons Licence\nOpen Data Institute, 5th Floor, Kings Place, 90 York Way, London N1 9AG\nPrivacy policy Contact us","version":"1.10.100"}
