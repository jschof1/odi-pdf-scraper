Governmentsunderstand this deeply\n2\nand\nhave devised strategies to support the transformation of their economies\n3\n. If they do\nnot, they risk seeing their existing industries replaced by technology providers, likely\nlocated in other countries\n4\n.\nAll sectors are experiencing a fundamental transformation. Technology products and\nservices are testing the traditional boundaries of technology and financial and\nprofessional services. This is mostly apparent in the context of Big Tech with\ncompanies like Alibaba, Tencent, Alipay\n5\n, Google,Facebook and Amazon\n6\n. This has\nprompted the coining of a new term, TechFin\n7\n, andthe development of numerous\nstudies on the impact\n8\nof technology companies deliveringfinancial services\n9\nand the\nfundamental questions we must consider\n10\n.\nMany in the traditional industries of financial and professional services still believe\nthat transformation is happening in the ‘other’ sectors, not in theirs. While some\nbelieve that transformation has already happened and that they are too late.\nA few, who have taken the time to understand existing disruptive technologies know\nthat they are masters of their own destiny. By leading the transformation, they ensure\nthat they secure new revenue opportunities for their organisations and seize\noperational efficiencies today\n11\n. We, atRegulAItion,are lucky that these individuals\nand the organisations they represent have chosen us as partners.\nThey have chosen theAIR Platformto deliver accessto information as they build a\nnew knowledge management infrastructure to support all of their digital\ntransformation initiatives.\nThe challenge we are all facing today is one of language and communication. We\nhear talk of ‘data access’, ‘data sharing’, ‘data availability’, ‘information sharing’,\n'knowledge management’ and many more expressions and terms that all relate to the\nsame subject: managing the increasing volume of knowledge we are all individually\nand collectively creating. How do we work together to gather and coordinate the\nknowledge we have and use it to serve our collective and common interests?\n11\nMckinsey (2018), ‘AI has the potential to deliveradditional global economic activity of around $13 trillion by 2030’\n10\nEuropean Banking Institute Working Paper Series 2017- No. 6 (2017),FinTech to TechFin: The\nRegulatory Challenges of Data-Driven Finance\n9\nInstitute of International Finance (2018), ‘A newkind of conglomerate: Bigtech in China’\n8\nFinancial Stability Board (2019)\n‘\nBigTech in finance:market developments and potential financial stability implications\n’\n7\nMy Tech Mag (2020), ‘FinTech vs. TechFin: Where isthe Future Headed?\n’\n6\nAmazon providing credit to merchants on its marketplace,Google’s tie up with CitiBank to provide\naccount services and Facebook’s pursuit of launching its own cryptocurrency.\n5\nInstitute of International Finance (2018), ‘Bigtechin China’\n4\nHM Treasury (2017),Regulatory Innovation Plan\n3\nUK Research and Innovation (2021), ‘Next GenerationServices Grand Challenge’\n2\nGOV.UK (2017), ‘Growing the artificial intelligenceindustry in the UK’\n1\nWE Forum (2016), ‘The Fourth Industrial Revolution:what it means, how to respond’\nOpen Data InstituteImproving data and information access in regulated sectors | July 2021           3\n\nThe global pandemic has shown that sharing knowledge can be existential to human\nlife and to our economies. The UK government is deeply aware that an infrastructure\napproach to knowledge management is essential. TheNational Data Strategyhas the\npotential to confer a unique advantage to the UK, helping to drive innovation, meet\nambitious policy goals, secure trade deals, address systemic risk and create a new\ncompetitive advantage on the world stage.\nMultiple technologies and solutions are coming to the rescue. How do we decide\nwhich technologies to adopt and why? That’s why this report is so important. It\nshares knowledge about the state of the industry and recommends actions in a clear\nframework that can be followed by businesses, regulators, governments and industry\nbodies to improve how we access information and share knowledge in regulated\nsectors.\nThis is an important and timely message. Breakthroughs for humankind have, after\nall, always come about through sharing and collaboration. Sharing of knowledge\ndates back to the earliest cave paintings. Societies evolved by communities working\nto create a common purpose. As we now face new frontiers, it's time to reimagine\nhow we share and work together.\nImagine a world where intelligence can be quickly unlocked in order to overcome\ncomplex health, economic and environmental challenges. Where competitors can\nsafely work together to achieve common goals.\nThat is the future each and every one of us at RegulAItion and the ODI can see. It is\nthe one we all want to live in. And this report is crucial in bringing us one step closer\nto it.\nOpen Data InstituteImproving data and information access in regulated sectors | July 2021           4\n\nExecutive summary\nTrustworthy and sustainable data access is the underpinning factor of any healthy\ndata ecosystem. This is true in regulated environments where data is particularly\nsensitive, privacy and confidentiality are enshrined for the main players, and the\nreputational and financial risks regarding compliance are high.\nThe Open Data Institute (ODI) and RegulAItion, funded by Innovate UK’s Industrial\nStrategy Challenge Fund, worked together to explore the landscape of access to data\nacross the regulated sectors of banking, accounting and law. In particular we\nresearched how innovative privacy enhancing technologies (PETs), and developments\nin machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) could improve trustworthy and\nsustainable data access across these sectors.\nHistorically, the sectors of banking, accounting and legal have been relatively change\nresistant when it comes to deploying data access technologies, with much of their\ntechnological investment focussed on data privacy and security instead. This is for a\nnumber of factors, chiefly that confidentiality and trust are crucial elements of the\nservices provided. In fact, as an industry expert said during our research, “trust is the\nmain product accountants sell”.\nDespite this deeply embedded culture of privacy and risk aversion, there has been\nsome notable progress. The most substantial and public example has been in the\nfinance sector with the implementation of open banking – a data portability initiative\nintended to empower banking consumers with greater control over data about their\nfinances, and to reduce the market power of the UK’s nine largest banks. The\naccounting and legal professions have not had such a seismic policy change, but\nhave been investing in ML and AI technologies to augment the skilled work of\nprofessionals in these fields. Organisations including The Institute of Chartered\nAccountants in England and Wales (ICAEW) and LawtechUK are leading in innovative\nresearch and development in their respective sectors.\nThere is now an opportunity for more data innovation across these sectors that would\nhave been unlikely even a few years ago. Findings from our research show that these\nchanges can be seen in three interconnecting ways: capacity building in people,\nimprovements in processes, and advancements in technology.\nPeople in these industries are more positive about data innovation than ever. The\nincreasingly hi-tech demands of clients, and the growing influence of internal\nchampions, have pushed these sectors to reevaluate desired skills. This has led to\nboth an increase in data scientists and other data roles (including ethics and strategy)\nwithin established businesses, and increased comfort with bringing in data and\nanalytics companies to perform important functions when there is not the required\nexpertise internally.\nProcesses for improving data access and sharing towards innovative ends have gone\nhand-in-hand with technological advancements. Although the need for highly secure\nOpen Data InstituteImproving data and information access in regulated sectors | July 2021           5\n\nand privacy-preserving activities remains as strong as ever, there have been pushes\nfor more open innovation processes. Examples include hackathons, data challenge\nseries and open forums for sharing best practice and learnings in trusted\nenvironments.\nTechnology has been a key enabler across these changes. The explosion in PETs\nover the last decade has fuelled trust in more open systems, and created increased\ndemand for data science capabilities to deploy these technologies. From\nanonymisation techniques, to sandbox environments and synthetic data, to\nalgorithmic privacy techniques like federated learning, PETs are driving data\ninnovation across these sectors.\nAlthough large organisations like multinational finance firms are investing a lot in\npeople, processes and technology in-house, a relatively new role has emerged that is\nalso well placed to provide these solutions to the market, the data intermediary.\nIntermediaries facilitate the access to data and information across data ecosystems.\nThis is often done by collating disparate datasets in a central location and vetting\nproviders and users of that data. New developments in PETs such as federated\nlearning are also allowing intermediaries to increase information flows in an\necosystem without ‘raw’ data ever being accessed or shared. This new generation of\nintermediaries, includingRegulAItion, is creatingvalue within their ecosystems\nwithout direct data access, improving security, privacy and data governance. When\ndata intermediaries securely facilitate valuable data and information flows in a sector,\nthey help to build a more open, trustworthy and sustainable data ecosystem.\nIn order for the regulated data ecosystems of the banking, accounting and legal\nsectors to further realise the benefits of data innovation, through better products and\nservices, improved consumer outcomes and easier legal compliance, data access\nneeds to be improved. Data intermediaries have an important role to play in this, but\neveryone with a stake in the ecosystem needs to play their part.\nData providers should convene an ecosystem of partners, suppliers and customers to\nexplore ways to increase access to data that will create business benefits, while\nrespecting privacy and minimising potential harm. Running or participating in\ninnovation programmes and accelerators or academic partnerships can be a safer\nand more trustworthy way of experimenting with data. Partnering with intermediaries\nthat can create value while minimising data exposure can help build secure,\ntrustworthy and sustainable data access models.\nGovernments and regulatory bodies should fund research and innovation\nprogrammes that will help to facilitate data collaboration to deliver value within\nspecific sectors and ensure that any data accessed or shared as part of regulatory\nchanges is made as open as possible within the appropriate considerations toward\nsecurity, sensitivity and privacy. Professional associations and industry bodies should\nconvene businesses within their networks to help map out current and future data\necosystems that will unlock value for all participants\nGreater data collaboration between data providers and data intermediaries within the\nbanking, accounting and legal sectors will create more sustainable and trustworthy\nOpen Data InstituteImproving data and information access in regulated sectors | July 2021           6\n\ndata ecosystems, ultimately driving greater value to businesses, consumers and\nwider society.\nOpen Data InstituteImproving data and information access in regulated sectors | July 2021           7\n\nBackground\nTrustworthy and sustainable data access is the fundamental factor of any healthy\ndata ecosystem. Our research into thevalue of datasharing in the private sectorhas\ndemonstrated that more data flowing through a business ecosystem creates benefits\nfor data users, data providers and beyond.\n12\nIncreaseddata access canimprove\nmarket reach,identify market insightsandoptimisesupply chains. But withouttrust,\ndata users will not access data that could otherwise further their goals; and without\nfinancialsustainability, that access eventually driesup.\nThis is especially true in the regulated sectors of banking, accountancy, and law\nwhere data is very sensitive, and regulation and compliance are very strict. In these\ndata ecosystems, we see that data flows are restrained both internally and externally\ndue to the needs of legal compliance and fears of breaching regulation. Strict data\nprotection and industry regulation can be a solid platform for ethical innovation in this\nspace that would allow for a more dynamic ecosystem without reducing security and\nprivacy or increasing harm.\nOne reason for improving access to data is to create value through innovative new\ntechnologies. As highlighted in ‘Growing The ArtificialIntelligence Industry In The UK’\nby Professor Dame Wendy Hall and Jérôme Pesenti, increased use of AI can bring\nmajor social and economic benefits.\n13\nWith AI, computerscan analyse and learn from\ndata with higher accuracy and speed than humans alone. AI could improve efficiency\nand performance in many sectors, including banking, accounting and legal.\nProfessors Hall and Pesenti identified that in order to acquire these gains,\norganisations must improve access to data by:\n●\nFacilitating the sharing of data between organisations holding data and\norganisations looking to use data to develop AI through proven and trusted\nframeworks and agreements, which would ensure exchanges are secure and\nmutually beneficial.\n●\nImproving the availability of data for developing AI systems. Government\nshould ensure that public funding for research explicitly ensures publication\nof underlying data in machine-readable formats with clear rights information,\nand open wherever possible.\n●\nSupporting text and data mining as a standard and essential tool for research\nby establishing by default that for published research the right to read is also\nthe right to mine data, where that does not result in products that substitute\nfor the original works\nIn line with the trends identified in this paper, RegulAItion was launched in 2018 to\nhelp unlock intelligence by reimagining the way in which organisations across the\n13\nGOV.UK (2017), ‘Growing The Artificial Intelligence Industry In The UK’,\nhttps://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/652097\n/Growing_the_artificial_intelligence_industry_in_the_UK.pdf\n12\nOpen Data Institute (2020), ‘Report: Sharing data to create value in the private sector’,\nhttps://theodi.org/article/report-sharing-data-to-create-value-in-the-private-sector/\nOpen Data InstituteImproving data and information access in regulated sectors | July 2021           8\n\nglobe access data, without sacrificing privacy or security. RegulAItion’s AIR Platform\nblends advanced federated learning, encryption, blockchain and AI techniques to\nchange the way data is accessed in the regulated sectors. It is developing the\ntechnology infrastructure and ecosystem for scalable, automated, repeatable and\nresponsible AI-driven data access, by enabling travelling algorithms to spot patterns\nin data without datasets needing to leave their secure premises.\nTo better understand this burgeoning market, the ODI and RegulAItion embarked on a\nresearch project across these sectors, exploring the needs, barriers andopportunities\nrelated to data access and sharing through AI and ML-based PETs. Our goal was to\nreview existing situations or problems and explore industry knowledge around\nworking with these types of data access and sharing.\nThis report includes some brief snapshots across the sectors in scope, the user\nresearch findings organised by People, Process and Technology, and\nrecommendations for different organisation types across the sectors.\nData access and innovation in regulated sectors\nEvery business is subject to regulation governing how it collects, uses and shares\ndata.\nUK businesses, regardless of industry, need to comply with data protection laws,\nsuch as the Data Protection Act, as well as requirements to report health and safety\ndata, pay equality, etc. Specific industries are also subject to regulation and laws that\nrequire them to collect and share data with regulators.\nFor example, businesses across the UK financial services industry need to share\nfinancial data with the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). The Financial Reporting\nCouncil (FRC) is responsible for regulating auditors, accountants and actuaries,\nreceiving data from them during audit periods. Legal services in the UK are regulated\nby a variety of organisations, including the Bar Standards Board in England and\nWales, and different organisations for Scotland and Northern Ireland.\nRegulatory compliance is necessary for companies to continue operating within their\nindustry; though this is sometimes portrayed as an unwelcome obligation, the need to\ncomply with regulation can be an opportunity to re-engage with customers and to\ndrive innovation.\nAs we noted in our case study ‘The value of sharingdata in regulated environments’\nin 2020, businesses share data both for regulatory purposes and more widely for their\nbusiness.\n14\nBeyond being a legal requirement, regulateddata sharing often creates\nbenefits for the organisations that share the data, as well as others in their industry\nand consumers. Often the most value is created when organisations take anticipatory\nactions or are ‘first movers’ in a newly regulated space, taking advantage of new\n14\nOpen Data Institute (2020), ‘Case study: The value of sharing data in regulated environments’,\nhttps://theodi.org/article/case-study-the-value-of-sharing-data-in-regulated-environments/\nOpen Data InstituteImproving data and information access in regulated sectors | July 2021           9\n\nopportunities with limited competition, and demonstrating commitment and\ntrustworthiness to regulators and the wider community.\nData intermediaries have been helping build and grow these data ecosystems for\nyears. They provide a range of services much needed by data providers and not\nfound in-house, predominantly technical, but also networking and advocacy services\nto ecosystems.\n15\nRegulators have an active role to play as well. They are well-situated to help improve\nhow data is used in their sectors and ecosystems by setting norms and standards or\nsupporting data flows.\nThree aspects of data infrastructure that are particularly important for supporting\ninnovation, and where regulators could have a role, are:\n●\naccess to data – who gets to use it and what for, which might include\nidentifying when data within a sector should be open, or who should be able\nto access data that is not open\n●\ndata governance – what policies and practices there should be to minimise\nharms and improve trust in data\n●\ndata standards – how to ensure that data can be combined in flexible ways,\nand is interoperable\nOrganisations like the Better Regulatory Executive (BRE) are focussed on finding the\nright combination of regulatory interventions to protect and empower citizens while\nsupporting innovation. Its paper ‘Regulation for thefourth industrial revolution’\nincludes a number of commitments to improve access, governance and standards\nacross regulated sectors.\n16\nThe UK is in a strong global position to deliver on the benefits of more\ninnovation-driven regulation through improved access to data. It is currently ranked\nfirst out of 37 countries across aggregate indexes of both primary and secondary\nlegislations in the OECD Regulatory Policy Outlook, fourth in the Global Innovation\nIndex, and joint first among 30 governments that have made concrete commitments\nto champion open data.\nOrganisations within the UK’s banking, accounting and legal sectors have already\nbegun making significant moves to both improve data access and invest in innovative\ntechnologies like AI within, and across, their sectors.\nData access and innovation in the banking sector\nA major driver of data access and innovation in the UK banking sector over the last\nfew years has been the implementation ofopen banking,and, with expansion into\n16\nGOV.UK (2019), “Regulation for the Fourth Industrial Revolution”,\nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/publications/regulation-for-the-fourth-industrial-revolution/regulation-for-t\nhe-fourth-industrial-revolution\n15\nWeb Foundation (2015), “Open Data Intermediaries: Their Crucial Role”,\nhttps://webfoundation.org/2015/08/open-data-intermediaries-their-crucial-role/\nOpen Data InstituteImproving data and information access in regulated sectors | July 2021           10\n\nopen financeand the widersmart dataecosystem planned, this trend is expected to\ngrow. Open banking is a data portability initiative designed to increase competition\nand innovation in the UK’s banking market by allowing individual and SME bank\ncustomers to securely share their data with third parties so a broad range of\nbusinesses can compete to provide bank customers with better financial services.\n17\nAccess to the increasing volumes of this data available through open banking has\nresulted in an accelerated use of AI and machine learning to create new propositions,\nsuch as in credit applications,\n18\nchatbots and personalfinancial managers.\n19\nOpen\nbanking and open finance driven AI may further improve operational efficiency\nthrough automated and autonomous decision-making and insight creation.\n20\nAnother area in the wider finance landscape where data sharing, AI and data\nintermediaries are proliferating is in alternative data for investing, or ‘alt data’.\n21\nAlt\ndata refers to new, non-traditional types of data, used to inform investment decisions.\nThis may be data about individuals such as footfall data, data about business\nprocesses such as credit card spend at retail stores, and data from physical sensors\nor satellites.\n22\nThese new data sources generate lots of unstructured data but it is difficult to analyse\nits value or combine it with other alt data and traditional investment datasets. ML\nprocesses are being deployed to decipher the potential value of this data.\nData access and innovation in the accounting\nsector\nData is also central to the work done by accountants and auditors. Although much of\nthe data that is still used today in these processes is not digital, there have been\nsignificant advances in data access and innovation with the knowledge that this can\nhelp accountants deliver more value to businesses.\nAccountants and auditors have many opportunities to use different sources of data\nand new analytics tools. Accountants are increasingly drawing on real-time data and\nnon-financial data to drive cost analysis and forecasting, while auditors use data\nanalytics to identify outliers and exceptions, and focus on the areas of greatest risk.\n23\nThis uptick in access to non-traditional data to be combined with traditional sources\nwill continue to improve these analytics as PETs allow for greater access to sensitive\nfinancial data.\n23\nICAEW (2019), “Big data and analytics: the impact on the accountancy profession”,\nhttps://www.icaew.com/technical/technology/data/data-analytics-and-big-data/big-data-and-analytics\n22\nODI (2020), “Building trust in alternative data ecosystems”,\nhttps://theodi.org/article/building-trust-in-alternative-data-ecosystems/\n21\nODI (2020), “Alternative data: exploring the ethical implications”,\nhttps://theodi.org/article/alternative-data-exploring-the-ethical-implications/\n20\nEuro Banking Association (2021), “Artificial Intelligence in the era of Open Banking”,\nhttps://www.abe-eba.eu/thought-leadership-innovation/open-banking-working-group/management-summ\nary-artificial-intelligence-in-the-era-of-open-banking/\n19\nDulcit.AI (2021), “Conversational AI”,https://www.ducit.ai/#conversationalai\n18\nLexology (2020) “Open banking, ‘big data’ and AI: what are the implications for the financial services\nsector?”,https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=688a8145-bb2b-46c6-bcb1-6af52c6e961e\n17\nOpen Banking Ltd.

Industry leaders are still developing\na full understanding of how AI can solve accounting and business problems.\nOrganisations like the ICAEW have identified areas with fruitful early research and\nimplementation projects in the areas of coding accounting entries, improving fraud\ndetection, forecasting revenues and analysing unstructured data.\n24\nData access and innovation in the legal sector\nLastly, the legal sector also provides a wide variety of opportunities for data access\nand AI. While legal services have been traditionally characterised as a relatively\nconservative market, new technologies, or LawTech, are disrupting the market as law\nfirms have adopted new technologies to reduce litigation costs, improve court system\nefficiency and drive broader innovation. Currently most LawTech solutions focus on\nroutine and administrative work, however investments are being made to achieve\nmore fundamental transformations using ML and AI.\n25\nThe main market drivers for improving privacy-preserving access to data and AI\nsolutions are the need for greater efficiency, increasing workloads and complexity of\nwork, increasingly ‘tech savvy’ staff and greater client pressure on costs and speed.\n26\nThis field is still less mature than other adjacent sectors such as financial\ntechnologies (fintech) where there is more funding and regulatory alignment. Within\nthe legal sector the B2B market is the most mature, particularly within large law firms,\nwith adoption of AI/ML applications in areas like legal analytics, project management\nand compliance and contract management.\nThe UK continues to invest in this space as a growth sector, increasing funding for\ncollaboration between businesses and researchers, AI-based PhDs, and more. Most\nrecently the University of Oxford launched a government-funded research programme\nto explore the potential and limitations of using AI in support of legal services.\n27\n27\nThomson Reuters (2019), “Legaltech Startup Report: A Maturing Market”,\nhttps://legalsolutions.thomsonreuters.co.uk/en/trends-insights/reports/legaltech-startup-report-2019.html\n26\nThe Law Society (2019), “Lawtech Adoption Research report”,\nhttps://www.lawsociety.org.uk/en/topics/research/lawtech-adoption-report\n25\nTheCityUK (2019), “Legal Excellence, Internationally Renowned: UK Legal Services 2019”,\nhttps://www.thecityuk.com/assets/2019/Report-PDFs/294e2be784/Legal-excellence-internationally-renow\nned-UK-legal-services-2019.pdf\n24\nICAEW (2018), “Artificial intelligence and the future of accountancy”,\nhttps://www.icaew.com/technical/technology/artificial-intelligence/artificial-intelligence-the-future-of-accountancy\nOpen Data InstituteImproving data and information access in regulated sectors | July 2021           12\n\nUser research findings\nFrom October 2020 to April 2021 we engaged in user research using a variety of\nstructured and semi-structured interviews and roundtables to collect views on the\nopportunities and challenges around data access and sharing, PETs and the use of AI\nand ML in regulated sectors, with a focus on the banking, accounting and legal\nsectors. User research participants included banks, accounting firms, legal services\nproviders and legal departments, regulators and government, industry bodies and\ntechnology policy organisations.\nWe have organised the findings according to the ITIL framework of People – including\nskills, attitudes and culture, Process – including organisational approaches,\nframeworks and policies, and Technology – including technological solutions\ndeployed internally and services purchased externally.\nPeople insights from market research\nLow sector maturity in ‘open culture’ and innovation champions\nThere are a number of deep rooted barriers that often hold large organisations back\nwhen it comes to data access. These include privacy, trust, transparency, commercial\nand ethical concerns. Perhaps the largest of all is a human resistance to change.\nOur research has identified the importance of ‘champions’ within organisations.\nIndividuals who aren’t afraid to challenge the status quo and are keen to push new\ninnovations. These champions tend to have a background in or familiarity with\ntechnology as opposed to many of their colleagues. Often, champions from different\nfirms will use networks and competitions to share ideas and best practice, and look\nfor opportunities to develop pilots or case studies to build an internal business case\nfor an innovation project.\nThere are a variety of organisations providing these services across the different\nsectors, including Innovate Finance in banking, the Tech Faculty at the ICAEW and\nDFK International in accounting, and LawtechUK in the legal sector. This process\nyields results, but can still be a difficult approach to push sector-wide innovation, as it\nis primarily based on the energy and availability of these select champions, without a\nrobust data strategy at the organisational level supporting them.\nCustomer influence on infrastructure\nLow ‘open culture’ maturity within organisations is an issue on the business side of\nthe relationship, as customers, primarily of larger and older organisations, tend to be\nless interested in, and more resistant to, trying new products and services. It is crucial\nthat the benefits of new services are clearly explained and quantified in order to help\nlarge organisations invest internally and build external partnerships.\nOpen Data InstituteImproving data and information access in regulated sectors | July 2021           13\n\nResearch participants from a traditional bank noted that product and service\ninnovation was much easier for challenger and digital-native banks due to their\ncustomer base. These banks attract customers who are less risk averse to trialling\nnew financial products, typically away from traditional banks, which gives these\nchallenger banks insight into how to drive customer value through new services.\nFirms in the accounting and legal industry are also somewhat dependent on client\npreferences and market behaviours, which can limit their decisions around technical\ninfrastructure. This can manifest in not wanting to use new solutions, such as\naversion to cloud storage and computing, or preferring email over new access\nprotocols. Conversely, when customers are keen to try new technologies, or are\nundergoing a digital transformation themselves, this affords accounting and legal\nservice providers opportunities to experiment.\nNascent investment in AI/ML proficiency in large organisations\nLarger commercial organisations and data providers are only beginning to invest in\nin-house AI and ML technical proficiency. This is currently happening in dedicated\ninnovation teams as the wider organisation is not yet sure about the tradeoff between\nrisks and benefits. In some organisations this can drive the perception that they are\nnot yet ready for AI/ML solutions.\nTechnology skills underpinning AI/ML solutions, such as cloud capabilities and data\nanalytics, are present in most large organisations, but have not been mobilised for\nuse in AI and ML. There is a real opportunity to develop these skills across the\nindustry, particularly in medium-sized organisations that tend to be lacking these\ncapabilities, as there has not been a significant client push factor.\nIn the absence of in-house skills, both large and medium-sized organisations may\noutsource the needs of AI/ML solutions on a case-by-case basis. These\norganisations may also enter innovation challenges, or trial different collaborations in\norder to gain access to these capabilities and help understand their value.\nThere is also a need for non-technical ML skills such as those related to data and AI\nliteracy, ethics and governance. Large organisations, especially in the finance sector,\nhave been investing in this space through hiring third parties to help perform these\nroles and train staff, as well as using available tools and methodologies to improve\ntheir own practices and principles.\nProcess insights from market research\nPrivacy, confidentiality and data management processes\nMost organisations across banking, accounting and legal need to follow an extensive\nsystem of compliance and control to move data or provide access rights, often with\nmultiple gatekeepers in every step that may differ across organisations. This occurs\nbetween firms, but also within firms crossing multiple jurisdictions or within firms\nspanning multiple sectors, such as accounting and advisory. Companies spanning\nmultiple jurisdictions and sectors are looking for ways to improve the legal sharing of\ninsights and information across jurisdictions without moving data.\nOpen Data InstituteImproving data and information access in regulated sectors | July 2021           14\n\nOrganisations have multiple roles to carry out different data responsibilities. For\nexample, a data protection officer (DPO) in a banking organisation would typically be\nresponsible for data flow within the organisation, while data access needs are met by\nthe information assurance team and customer ‘know your client’ (KYC) data is\nmanaged by the compliance team.\nIn the legal sector confidentiality is paramount and seen as highly restrictive to data\nflows and innovation. In our roundtable co-hosted with LawtechUK, ‘owing\nconfidentiality to clients’ was ranked the top risk to data access and sharing. Despite\nthis, many participants intimated that the catch-all of confidentiality was not always a\nhelpful term and can often be used to avoid seeking challenging yet rewarding\nsolutions. Participants agreed that there would be value in reviewing and stratifying\nconfidentiality within the industry in order to make data and information more\naccessible, and derive benefits such as operational efficiencies, new services and\ncost savings from it.\n‘One-size-fits-all’ access models\nOrganisations in regulated sectors tend towards a one-size-fits-all data access\napproach based on the strictest privacy and security requirements in the\norganisation. It is often the simplest approach to complying with regulation in a\ncomplex data landscape, with high penalties for mistakes. This over-compliance is\noften seen as an excuse to avoid unwanted actions.\nMany stakeholders believe that varying data access policies based on sensitivity of\nthe data and privacy requirements could improve efficiency in data innovation\ninternally and externally. However, individuals leading efforts to adapt the access\nmodel often lack the buy-in and resources to create a powerful case while contending\nwith a strongly-mandated compliance department.\nParticipants mentioned that when this pain point is voiced at industry-wide forums\nand in peer networks, it is often met with widespread acknowledgment as a common\nissue. Coordination at these events, which lack a specific purpose or commitments\nfrom attendees aligned with this topic, often does not progress much further than\nrelationship building.\nExpanding and overlapping peer networks\nMany research participants discussed how they as individuals or their organisations\nwere likely in multiple mission-driven peer networks and industry organisations, in\norder to seek benefits from greater innovative collaboration. Networks such as\nInnovate Finance, Tech Nation and DFK International brought together innovation\nchampions and provided a forum for them to engage in greater collaboration.\nHowever as mentioned above, these collaborations often lacked significant\norganisational support.\nParticipants still appreciated the benefits of these industry bodies, and especially\ntheir overlap with the ‘official’ government-licensed networks such as ICAEW, The\nLaw Society and UK Finance. They believe these linked networks provide\nopportunities for beneficial partnerships that could result in improved data\ncollaboration and innovation.\nOpen Data InstituteImproving data and information access in regulated sectors | July 2021           15\n\nTechnology-forward departments and partnerships\nProof points in more digitally savvy parts of the business, or innovation trial\npartnerships are being used to make the case for more investment in digital skills,\nprocesses and technologies. Sometimes this produces clashes between traditional IT\nfunctions against innovative teams, but other times, champions within those\ntraditional IT functions will use the success of internal experiments or third-party\npartnerships to make their own cases internally.\nIndustry bodies and regulators also collaborate with innovative startups in different\nways. Some through incubation programmes, such as ICAEW helping grow, regulate\nand later invest in for-profit company Engine B to provide greater interoperability in\nthe audit and accounting sector. Some through funding research, such as FCA\nbecoming a soft collaborator in RegulAItion’s AIR platform, and helping develop a use\ncase for the market.\nBanks involved in the open banking ecosystem typically partner with startups to\ndeliver new solutions that drive benefits for their customers. Participants from a\ntraditional bank discussed the idea of being able to start a challenger bank connected\nto the traditional bank. Such an initiative would allow for greater freedom in\nexperimentation and could be a ‘proof point’ for the traditional bank and its more risk\naverse customers.\nInnovation programme and challenge popularity\nInnovation programmes are popular amongst regulators, data providers and data\nintermediaries as they provide a good vehicle to experiment with new services, build\npartnerships and build topic awareness.\nThey often provide low risk environments for innovation as the data is usually either\nsynthetic or compliant with regulations. Investments in the programmes and\nchallenges are also lower risk investments, due to the relationship building, coaching\nand marketing that comes with it.\nAs an additional benefit, organisations, especially data intermediaries, from\npredominantly different sectors often participate. This allows for a cross-pollination of\nideas, techniques and technologies from different sectors.\nNon-technical standards for data\nIn our research onopen standards for data, we notethat besides technical standards\nfor data such as file formats and data models, non-technical standards for data are\nimportant to consider as well. These non-technical standards include codes of\npractice and importantly, terminology.\nOrganisations across banking, accounting and legal use different terms such as ‘data\nsharing’, ‘data access’, ‘data transfer’, and rarely consistently. Broadly speaking, data\nsharing is perceived as something done externally and involves data leaving a\nboundary, whereas data access is more internal and data is seen as not moving.\nIn many cases, including most day-to-day discussion, inconsistent terminology is not\nan issue. However in heavily regulated areas where legal and regulatory compliance is\nforegrounded, terminology can break down more open data processes due to fears\nOpen Data InstituteImproving data and information access in regulated sectors | July 2021           16\n\nthat misunderstanding will lead to a legal or compliance breach. Some organisations\nare trying to mitigate this uncertainty by creating publicly available glossaries, being\nclear about their language to smooth out these processes.\nTechnology insights from market research\nLow adoption of AI/ML technologies\nAs reflected above regarding AI/ML skills, organisations have had a low adoption of\nAI tools and ML algorithms.\n‘The Kalifa Review of Fintech’ echoed the sentiments of many research participants,\nthat ‘deep expertise in artificial intelligence, data and machine learning are in short\nsupply within the UK.’\n28\nPlans to address this includeretraining and upskilling adults\nto meet the needs of UK fintech by ensuring access to short courses from\nhigh-quality education providers at low cost.\nIn the meantime however, large firms are starting to invest more in the digital and\ndata capabilities needed for proper AI/ML adoption. This includes data science\ndepartments, and ensuring that AI ethics is an internal priority.\nExperimenting with privacy-enhancing techniques\nIn order to test and implement new data innovations, organisations use a variety of\nanonymisation and privacy-enhancing techniques on testing and modelling data. In\ngeneral, organisations are open to multiple PETs but focus on those that make it\neasiest to share while retaining quality and privacy.\nBanking organisations and regulators have primarily used synthetic datasets for\nmachine learning modelling and trialling, preferring this method for ease of sharing\nand good fidelity overall. Federated learning algorithms are also being deployed to\nhelp develop use cases focussed on regulatory compliance and combating financial\ncrime.\nUse cases being developed in the accounting and legal sectors have so far focussed\nprimarily on developing federated learning solutions for use cases involving unquoted\ncompany valuations, and decisions on legal advice respectively.\nUse of third-party providers (TPPs)\nAccounting and law firms use TPPs to manage data externally and internally, using\nthe default audit functionalities and inheriting the access rules accordingly. There is\nan appetite for the use of external partners to provide data management services.\nAn underlying reason for this is the prevalence of legacy systems that create\nblockages and bottlenecks for lots of internal development. Participants noted that\nlegacy systems are more likely to get updated when there is external pressure,\ngenerally from a business case or partnership involving data access and sharing.\n28\nGov.uk (2021), “The Kalifa Review of UK FinTech”,\nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-kalifa-review-of-uk-fintech\nOpen Data InstituteImproving data and information access in regulated sectors | July 2021           17\n\nOpen banking partnerships have also shown the value of TPPs in delivering\ninnovative new services outside of traditional bank core offerings. These partnerships\nspan from price comparison and micropayment services, to personal finance\nmanagers that use increasingly sophisticated algorithms to improve customer\nfinancial health.\nSandboxes and scaleboxes\nInnovation teams within regulators and large data providers are often unable to get\naccess to as much data as they want in order to run innovation experiments with\nexternal partners. In order to work around this barrier they have implemented\nsandbox technology to provide a safe environment for developers to work on new\npropositions.\nBoth the FCADigital Sandbox Pilotand theOpen BankingDirectory Sandboxhave\nbeen cited as examples of regulator-provided sandboxes that provided useful\nexperiences to their partners that they would not have been able to access otherwise.\nThe success of the FCA pilot has led to an extension of the programme both in length\nand scope. The FCA has also agreed to introduce a scalebox called a ‘regulatory\nnursery’ in order to help scale-ups with growth and securing investment.\nOpen Data InstituteImproving data and information access in regulated sectors | July 2021           18\n\nRecommendations\nOur research has shown that improving access to data generally, and through\ninnovative privacy preserving means specifically, is anticipated to bring significant\nbenefits to the banking, accounting and legal sectors.\nWe see that data providers are interested in AI/ML solutions for data-driven\nregulation, compliance and supervision, and that these solutions are being developed\nboth in-house and by data intermediaries looking to fill gaps in the market, and move\nit forward. Equally, government, regulators and industry bodies are encouraging\ninnovation in this space, proving the lie that innovation and regulation are at odds\nwith each other, or need to be balanced against each other.\nTo further explore this area, we have identified a number of recommendations for\ndifferent stakeholders within the ecosystem, including data intermediaries and data\nproviders, and governments, regulators and industry bodies. Unlocking the benefits\nof more open and trustworthy data ecosystems will require collaboration across a\nrange of stakeholders.\nFor data intermediaries\n●\nBuild partnerships with regulators, industry bodies and data providers. This\nwill help your organisation demonstrate trustworthiness in the sector, improve\nsector-specific knowledge, and help develop common standards (such as\ndata models, sector vocabulary and PET best practice), which will drive\nbetter data access services.\n●\nParticipate in innovation challenges, ideally sponsored by potential partners.\nThis will help to test new product ideas, build valuable connections in the\necosystem and demonstrate the value of product offerings.\n●\nRun sustainable data access workshops to understand what the best mix of\nrevenue streams is, specifically looking at subscription fees, membership\nfees, and additional or premium services. Open source tools like the ODI’s\nSustainable Data Access Workbookcan help facilitatethese workshops.\n●\nRun trustworthy data access workshops to understand what the main\nsignifiers of trust and trustworthiness are in relevant sectors, such as\ncertification, membership of industry networks and commitments to\nopenness, such as publishing open access research and open data. Open\nsource tools like the ODI’sTrustworthy Data StewardshipGuidebookcan help\nfacilitate these workshops.\n●\nProduce research and case studies around sector and technology trends.\nThis will help your organisation to understand the latest relevant\ndevelopments in your sector, deliver valuable insights to others in the\necosystem and improve your trustworthiness to potential clients and\npartners.\nOpen Data InstituteImproving data and information access in regulated sectors | July 2021           19\n\nFor data providers\n●\nEducate users on the new technologies and mindsets required to really thrive\nin data economies. Utilising modern technologies to achieve better outcomes\ndoes not happen overnight, it requires organisational and cultural change.\nDemonstrate how a mindset shift to secure, privacy-preserving data access\nwill help to overcome common innovation obstacles and empower teams to\ndeliver real change, fast.\n●\nReview current approaches to sharing data, both for regulatory compliance\nand for commercial propositions. Explore where new approaches to\nprivacy-preserving data access and processes like ML and AI could deliver\nadditional business value. Address internal concerns about the risks of data\nsharing, and ensure there are appropriate policies that enable safe and\nautomated access to data at scale. Understand where a one-size-fits-all\napproach is reducing data access and use in less sensitive areas of the\nbusiness.\n●\nConvene an ecosystem of partners, suppliers and customers to explore:\n○\nUse cases where improving access to data can create business\nbenefits\n○\nHow to make regulatory compliance more efficient and trustworthy\nthrough data-driven processes\n○\nForegrounding data ethics within typical business practices\n○\nWhere common standards, from technology decisions, to data\nmodel, to vocabulary (such as around confidentiality, or data access\nvs sharing) could improve data access and interoperability\n○\nShare best practices and success stories to drive a more open\nculture in the banking, accounting and legal sectors\n●\nDevelop a data strategy that will help to improve data governance, develop\nthe internal data literacy of the business, and promote partnerships with\ninnovative data intermediaries. Locate and encourage innovation champions\nwithin the organisation that can lead on initiatives within the strategy. Set\nmeasurable objectives to ensure compliance with these goals.\n●\nExplore the commercial landscape for PETs and AI/ML-driven data access\nand innovation. This can be done through individual partnerships with data\nintermediaries, running innovation programmes with startups and scaleups,\nand funding research and development with academia.\n●\nDevelop an explicit approach to data ethics and AI ethics. Open source tools\nlike the ODIData Ethics CanvasandConsequence Scanningcan help\nilluminate current gaps and opportunities.\nFor government, regulators and industry bodies\n●\nConvene businesses, including data providers, data intermediaries and other\ntechnology providers within their networks to help map out current and future\nprivacy preserving data access arrangements. These could include reusable\ndata sharing frameworks, sector data institutions, and more openly\naccessible metadata on data that cannot be easily shared.\nOpen Data InstituteImproving data and information access in regulated sectors | July 2021           20\n\n●\nRun innovation programmes, like theDigital sandbox pilot: FCA DataSprint,\nthat will help to facilitate open innovation around data access, PETs, and\nAI/ML product development within specific sectors. Data availability\nmechanisms should be built into the design and functioning of all such\nsandboxes as an enduring regulatory principle.\n●\nFund and support work to scope and incubate businesses aiming to develop\nPETs to improve regulated data access, that will help organisations within a\nsector to share data in ways that will preserve privacy and increase trust\n●\nFund research and case studies around the opportunities for PETs and AI/ML\nto improve data access in regulated sectors\n●\nSupport the development of legal frameworks, guidance, codes of practice\nand training that will help support ethical, legal and trustworthy sharing of\ndata across a range of sectors. Foreground the development of both\ntechnical and non-technical data skills.\nOpen Data InstituteImproving data and information access in regulated sectors | July 2021           21\n\nAppendix 1:\nMethodology\nWe took a holistic approach to gathering the existing thought process of industries\ninvolved in the problem space by doing an in-depth exploratory study. Formative\nresearch methodologies were used with divergent (phase 1) and convergent (phase 2)\nthinking.\nPhase 1 was about exploring the problem and phase 2 was about defining the\nproblem and figuring out the concrete actions needed to tackle the usage of data.\nOur original goal was to interview organisations from the banking, accounting, legal\nand insurance sectors. Given the unavailability or unwillingness of stakeholders from\nthe insurance industry to participate in our research, the insurance sector was\ndescoped to maintain a robustness of results.\nPhase 1/Pilot (Explore the problem)\nIn this phase, we aimed to start understanding the experience of each participant in\norder to identify the range of problems that exist. Desk research (literature review) was\ncarried out to get a better understanding of the context and semi-structured in-depth\ninterviews were conducted to understand user pain points, barriers and motivations.\nLater, insights were drawn out through using thematic coding data analysis\ntechniques and organised by People, Process and Technology.\nWhy was an in-depth semi-structured interview used as data collection?\nThe primary sources of data collection in formative research are often semi-structured\nin-depth interviews. The use of in-depth interviews enables the researcher to explore\nOpen Data InstituteImproving data and information access in regulated sectors | July 2021           22\n\nissues with participants through encouraging depth and rigour, which facilitates the\nemergence of new concepts/issues and contributes to the ‘richness of data’ required\nin the discovery stage. A conversational approach to the interviews was adopted to\nget deeper context from the participants.\nPhase 2 (Define the problem)\nFrom phase 1, we established a range of insights. We prioritised them to focus on\nand explore a few high-value areas that would help define the key directions, uncover\nthe high-level user needs and identify the riskiest assumptions. To do this we\nfacilitated roundtable discussions, surveys and structured in-depth interviews.\nIn phase 1, we observed that the participants were wary about speaking on the\ntopics of data access and sharing, due to internal compliance and the impact it could\nhave on reputation. To mitigate the risk of being unable to gather organisations for\nroundtables and ensure the study was not compromised, the team designed an\nin-depth interview format and survey as a back-up tool to gather any additional\ninsights.\nIn general in both interviews and roundtables we employed the Chatham House rule\nor simply promised that our findings will not be attributed to individuals or\norganisations. This allowed a more open and timely discussion, as many of the\norganisations we spoke to have very strict and arduous compliance processes for\npublicly attributable statements. Engaging in this process would have reduced the\nvalue and the volume of the insights we gathered.\nIn addition we sought to design an effective questionnaire for phase 2 by avoiding\nbiases with questions that were formulated with careful interventions, such as using\nprobes rather than leading questions. However our results in the questionnaire were\ntoo low to use independently in our final report, and the findings from it have only\nbeen included as part of overall trends in the findings from our research. RegulAItion\nintends to deploy the questionnaire in future market research where appropriate.\nResearch questions\nThe aim of the research study was to understand the potential of, and barriers to,\ndata access in the regulated sectors of banking, accounting, legal and insurance in a\nway that could both help key stakeholders in those sectors improve data access and\nto help understand the viability of RegulAItion's AIR Platform proposition.\nThe research questions that followed were:\n1.\nWhat is the biggest challenge at the moment in the [name of the industry]\nindustry on how data is shared/accessed?\n2.\nCan you please list the use cases/business needs that require information to\nbe shared?\n3.\nCan you please list the internal process that needs to be taken before\ninformation can be shared?
