About
This report is based on research carried out by the Open Data 
Institute as a partner in the Open Data Incubator for Europe. 
Specifically, it draws upon the ODI’s primary research for the 
ODINE D6.3 business models, lessons learned and success 
stories deliverable.

About the ODI
ODI works to build a strong, fair and sustainable data 
economy by helping governments and businesses around 
the world get data to people who need it. It is independent, 
nonprofit and nonpartisan, founded in 2012 by 
Sir Tim Berners-Lee and Sir Nigel Shadbolt. From its 
headquarters in London and via its global network of 
startups, members and nodes, the ODI offers training, 
research and strategic advice for organisations looking 
to explore the possibilities of data. 
Since its inception in 2013, the ODI startup programme has 
supported 33 startups spread across five ‘cohorts’. Initially 
the programme focussed on businesses that placed open 
data at the core of their business model and had a 
triple-bottom-line impact socially, environmentally and 
economically. The evolution of the data-enabled economy 
sector demonstrated that most business models, whilst 
adopting an open-innovation approach, incorporated a blend 
of open and shared data. In response to this, we broadened 
the scope of the latest cohort to include a wide range of 
data-enabled startups. 
As a whole, startups incubated by the ODI while in the 
programme have secured around £16m in sales and 
investments and directly employed more than 130 people. 
About ODINE
The Open Data Incubator for Europe (ODINE) was a six-
month incubator programme for startups and SMEs across 
Europe looking to innovate with open data. The programme 
was delivered by seven European partners and funded by the 
EU’s Horizon 2020 initiative. It looked to help startups and 
SMEs to innovate with open data to develop or improve 
products and services. Over 20 months, the ODINE project 
funded 57 companies from 18 different European countries 
across a range of industries and markets. Alongside funding, 
the programme provided a number of services, including 
mentoring and coaching sessions, as well as peer to peer 
support and networking. Across the eight cohorts of startups, 
ODINE has resulted in €23.7M of sales, investment and 
efficiencies, and generated 278 jobs.
[2]
 Furthermore, the 
startups have created over 50 open data products or 
services, which in turn provide new opportunities for other 
companies within the ecosystem.

Executive summary
Data is infrastructure on which the modern economy is built. Data’s 
increasing ubiquity and abundance makes it vital in every sector, and 
businesses of every size are becoming more and more dependent. 
Open data is creating value for society and the economy.
[3]
 In this age 
of data abundance the amount of open data available will keep 
increasing. Individual businesses, especially startups and SMEs, 
can take advantage of open data in many ways.
By analysing data alone or 
together with third parties, 
retailers By pioneering value 
propositions and business 
models that take advantage of 
open data now, businesses can 
get ahead of the competition. 
This paper presents key lessons learned about the role of 
open data in successful business models, based on the ODI’s 
experience incubating startups and on research carried out 
as part of the Open Data Incubator for Europe 
(ODINE) programme.
[4]
These lessons are not exhaustive, however we hope they can 
help guide new and existing startups and SMEs to create 
value with open data. Although the exact business models 
surrounding open data are still evolving, the value of open 
data to business is clear. What these lessons show is the 
unique opportunity that open data creates for startups and 
SMEs to create growth, extract value and ensure 
sustainability while defining the successful business models 
of the future.
Key lessons for businesses
 You don’t have to be an ‘open data startup’ to 
benefit from open data.
 While some businesses are set up to explicitly take 
advantage of the opportunities presented by open data, 
many other businesses are building new products 
and services or enhancing their existing offering with 
open data.
 Beyond consumption: open data publishing is 
creating value for small business.
 Access to open data presents businesses with a valuable 
opportunity to innovate but increasingly businesses are 
publishing open data to attract new customers, improve 
customer experience and capture new markets.
 Freemium subscription models are being used to 
generate revenue from publishing open data.
 Revenue models for products and services based on open 
data tend to adopt ‘as-a-service’ subscription revenue 
models and when it comes to publishing open data, 
businesses are increasingly using freemium models to 
derive revenue while keeping data open.
 Greater value is created by combining different 
data from multiple sources.
 Strong value propositions are often built to solve very 
complex problems. Businesses often address them by 
combining a wide variety of data types from different open, 
shared and closed sources. 
 Services built on open data are of value to a wide 
range of organisations and individuals.
 The products and services built with open data are useful 
to a diverse range of businesses, governments and 
individuals from across the whole economy.

Building business models involving open data
Categorising business models is often done through 
frameworks, the most widely used of which is the Business 
Model Canvas.
[15]
 This breaks down any business model 
into nine core building blocks. Academics, businesses and 
research organisations have been using these frameworks 
to evaluate emerging trends and patterns among those 
building products and services with open data. The Creative 
Commons team have developed an Open Business Model 
Canvas
[16]
 to describe business models built on openly 
licensed content. This fed into their work on the Made 
with Creative Commons
[17
 project, designed to document 
such businesses.
Others who have begun to categorise different trends include 
Ferro and Osella,
[18]
 Howard,
[19]
 Zeleti,
[20]
 Ojo and Curry, 
Jeni Tennison,
[21]
 the World Wide Web Foundation
[22]
 and 
Deloitte.
[23]
 In our research for ODINE, we compiled a 
synthesis of the emerging trends and patterns identified in 
existing research. This report, however, will not build on 
these categories but will explore broader findings relating to 
components of models currently used by SMEs and startups.
Better understanding of open data business 
models through ODINE 
The ODINE programme provided diverse examples of 
successful value propositions and business models involving 
open data. The 57 companies that were given funding came 
from 12 industries, 18 European countries and varied 
between established SMEs and startups born within the 
programme. On completion of the programme, the estimated 
return on investment (ROI) was 300x, with an independent 
evaluation
[24]
 projecting this to grow to 540x return on 
investment by 2020. 
The goal of the research on which this paper is based was 
to explore the business models of the ODINE-funded 
companies, and use them to help inform wider research 
into open data and business models.
[25]
The goal of this report is to help startups, SMEs and Venture 
Capitalists (VCs) to understand the business value that can 
be created through open data and to explore some of the 
new models that can capture that value. We do this by 
sharing lessons from our research into the successful ODINE 
companies and our work with other businesses. We believe 
that these new business models provide a glimpse of the 
future data economy.
The value of open data
Current estimates suggest the value of public sector open 
data sits between 0.4% and 4.1% of GDP.
[10]
 However, 
existing research tends to focus on the benefits of open data 
to the wider economy, rather than the benefits it can bring to 
individual organisations. 
Research has revealed the huge amount of value created by 
individual open datasets, primarily those published by 
governments. For example, a study of the US Landsat data 
– comprising satellite imagery of the Earth’s surface
published under an open licence – found that the dataset
generated an estimated $2.19bn economic benefit in
2011 alone.
[11]
Other research has been able to quantify the overall value of 
an organisation publishing open data. For instance, Transport 
for London’s release of open transport data was recently 
estimated to be worth up to £130m per year for travellers; 
London and TfL itself in saved time, operational efficiency 
and jobs.
[12]
 However, there are few estimates of the value 
created for individual private sector companies, and next to 
none on the value they derive from publishing their own 
open data. 
The ODI has been working with companies of various sizes 
and capturing the lessons learned through research into open 
data businesses. This report represents the third in a trio of 
products sharing these lessons, alongside the ‘Open data 
means business’
[13]
 and ‘Open enterprise’
[14]
 studies.
More businesses are 
recognising the opportunities 
available to build and enhance 
their value proposition using 
open data.
Open data is data that anyone can access, use and share,
[5]
 
by virtue of the limited set of constraints imposed by 
publishing data under an open licence.
[6]
 With increasing 
amounts of open data available, more businesses are 
recognising the opportunities available to build and enhance 
their value proposition using open data. Open data brings 
more than just access to new data sources – it is allowing 
businesses to explore innovative business models that 
include publishing open data or supporting others to 
publish it. 
The unique selling point for businesses using data does not 
arise from exclusive access to the data, but what they do with 
it and how that helps customers make decisions.
The ODI has been working with open data startups and SMEs 
since it was founded in 2012. This report shares some 
lessons learned about innovative startups and SMEs that 
have built unique value propositions based on open data. We 
draw upon recent research
[7]
 that was carried out by the ODI 
for the EU-funded Open Data Incubator for Europe (ODINE) 
programme,
[8]
 additional analysis of the data from this 
research and our own experiences with the ODI 
Accelerator programme.

37% said their company would be able to exist without 
open data. These businesses, especially in the ODINE 
context, are typically businesses with an existing value 
proposition. While they are not dependent on open data, 
they tend to be exploring the opportunity presented by open 
data for building new products or services, or enhancing 
their existing offering. As well as offering access to a wider 
variety of data, open data allows them to try things out and 
experiment more quickly – without having to buy access 
to data or negotiate data-sharing agreements.
None of the respondents to our research said they would 
be able to easily exist without open data. This clearly 
indicates that all the businesses believe open data is playing 
some role in their overall success, even if it is not necessary 
for their survival.
Diversity of industry
We asked companies which industry best described their 
area of business. Just over half the respondent companies 
did not consider themselves first and foremost a tech 
company. These companies placed themselves across 10 
different industries, from healthcare to education. While it is 
likely that most of the companies are technologically 
advanced and data-savvy, they are attempting to build 
products and services with open data to tackle existing 
industry problems. Those who do consider themselves a 
tech  company are most likely to be working across several 
traditional market sectors.
Organisations are increasingly 
building open data into their 
businesses; some without even 
realising it.
Where in the past, open data may have seemed like a 
niche field, populated by specialist ‘open data businesses’, 
increasingly we are seeing organisations of all types building 
open data into their business, some without even realising it.
Open data is simply data that has been published under an 
open licence for anyone to access, use or share. All modern 
businesses are now looking to make better use of data. 
Whatever field, industry or market a business is in, there is 
likely to be useful and relevant data available. Our research 
into the ODINE companies found clear evidence that a 
range of different businesses from different sectors and 
geographies were integrating open data into their 
business models.
How core is open data to your business?
We asked the ODINE companies how important open 
data was to the existence of their companies. Of those who 
responded, there was a fairly even split between three 
different ways in which they were taking advantage of 
open data. 
29% said their company would not exist without open 
data. These are what might typically be described as ‘open 
data companies’. They tend to build services specifically 
around open data. They are often members of ‘the open data 
community’ and are likely to have built a value proposition 
around openness.
34% said their company would struggle to exist without 
open data. These businesses are more focused on a value 
proposition that is enabled by data, using open data to lower 
costs or time to market. While open data may not be at the 
core of their products and services,it has become a key 
factor in their overall success.

The role of open data
We asked companies whether they used, published or 
supported others to publish open data; 93% used it, 55% 
were publishing and 60% were supporting others to publish 
it. While open data use is high, over half the respondents 
were publishing or supporting others to publish indicates the 
wider role businesses play in the data economy.
Open data plays more than one role in 81% of respondent 
companies, suggesting that businesses generate value from 
open data in more diverse ways than simply by ingesting 
and selling it. One in four companies used, published and 
supported others to publish open data, compared to less 
than one in five only using open data.
Half of the respondents both used and published open data, 
which indicates that they built products and services based 
on it, which in turn led to data being published. This might 
indicate that the companies are ‘infomediaries’ – businesses 
that clean or improve open data to re-publish and sell access 
to it. However, there are also a number of companies who 
publish open data as part of the wider products and services 
they provide.
The importance of the role that open data plays
We asked companies about how important role was for 
their products and services, and their value propositions. 
The research showed that on the whole, use of open data 
played a core role in 25% of the businesses and a key role 
in a further 63%. This was much higher than either 
publishing (14% core, 32% key) or supporting open data 
(4% core, 44% key). 
New models building on and 
republishing data are 
challenging the notion that 
data’s value comes from 
limiting access to it.
Open data has begun to play a much wider role in 
businesses, with new models looking not only to use open 
data but to build on and republish data, support others to 
publish and generally drive open data publishing further. 
These models run counter to the dominant position on data, 
which is that value can only be derived from data by limiting 
access to it. What makes these models particularly appealing 
for startups is their ability to capture existing markets, create 
new markets and produce network effects. This leads to 
greater value creation for the startups themselves and the 
industries or markets they operate in.
Beyond consumption: 
creating value  
through publishing
Case study: BikeCitizens
BikeCitizens is a good example of a startup benefitting from 
open data without being an ‘open data startup’.
[28]
 The 
company’s primary offering is a smartphone application which 
offers cyclists route planning services. BikeCitizens also sell 
smartphone mounts, which enable the cyclist to attach their 
smartphone to the handlebars of any bike. 
BikeCitizens business model revolves around partnering with 
cities to license their cycling app in order to make it free to 
download for their citizens. BikeCitizens also collect data from 
users and provide aggregated data to cities to help them 
understand cycling in the city and explore ways to improve city 
design for cyclists.
However, after obtaining funding from ODINE, the company 
could use and publish open data on bike-sharing service 
locations to improve access to bike-sharing services in cities 
through their application. They also use OpenStreetMap and 
open weather data in their application and this has enhanced 
their value proposition so they now reach over 430 cities

Case study: Green City Solution
Open data is playing a role in Green City Solutions’ business 
model and product, CityTree, which addresses the global 
problem of air pollution.
[30]
A CityTree is a free-standing vertical plant display, which 
combines a special moss culture with the company’s own 
Internet of Things (IoT) technology. The moss is attached to air 
vents in order to speed up the air cleansing process and collect 
data about the types and levels of pollution in the city. The 
plant is capable of targeting and reducing air pollution, such as 
fine dust and nitrous oxides, up to 275 times more efficiently 
than a normal tree.
CityTrees have been implemented in several European cities, 
with vertical plant displays in city streets of Oslo (Norway), 
Paris (France), Hanover, Dresden and Berlin (Germany) and 
Hong Kong. Green City Solutions ensure profitability by 
implementing visual and digital information on the product 
for marketing purposes. The product also contains smart 
sensors, which collect environmental and climatic data, 
allowing regulation and control units to ensure that moss 
culture survives. The business can also integrate benches with 
wi-fi spots and e-bike charging services for an additional cost. 
CityTrees collect data on air quality and Green City Solutions 
use and publish it to benefit the cities where the trees are being 
used. Open data therefore generates new possibilities to 
analyse data about air quality, enabling cities to make better 
environmental decisions.

Freemium models for open data services
We asked companies if their product was ever free at the 
point of use in order to examine the prevalence of the 
freemium model, and to understand other sales strategies 
including free trial services. Over three fifths of companies 
employed a freemium model for their product or service, 
whether that was data itself or another service.
 
Deriving revenue from open data
We asked businesses how they derived revenue from the 
products and services they had developed with open data, 
including but not limited to data itself. 86% of businesses 
derived revenue using a subscription fee – with 49% using 
subscription fees as their only revenue model – suggesting 
that, on the whole, ODINE companies are selling ongoing 
access to data, platforms and services.
Only 32% of companies used one or more revenue streams 
that did not involve direct payment from the customer. Just 
over a fifth of companies were employing some form of 
cross-subsidy model – either attracting customers to other 
paid-for products and services, or using open data to 
generate leads for other transactions. However, only 5% of 
businesses were relying exclusively on this strategy, while 
the rest also employed direct revenue models. 
Many businesses are already 
using, publishing and 
supporting others to publish 
open data as part of viable 
paid-for products and services.
Where businesses are not charging directly for products or 
services, there are usually indirect revenue strategies 
in place.
One common approach to non paid-for services, especially 
around the publication of open data by businesses, is the use 
of freemium models. Freemium models grant access,

Case study: OpenGazettes
OpenGazettes aim to make government gazettes more 
accessible to companies and individuals around the world.
[33]
 
Gazettes are official journals published online and accessed 
globally, which are used for research or for private companies 
assessment. They contain information such as notices of 
incorporation, dissolutions, mergers and more. However, these 
notices are hardly ever linked to the right companies. Run by 
OpenCorporates, which manages the largest open database 
of companies in the world, OpenGazettes aim to connect 
companies with the correct notices and contracts.
OpenGazettes derive their revenue from open data using a 
freemium subscription model: users are able to access some 
of the data for free if using it for public benefit, but must pay 
fees for personal or corporate use of the database. At present, 
fees are charged in accordance with a user’s daily or monthly 
access to API documentation. 
Open data was crucial in allowing gazettes to be published 
and accessed openly in order for companies to be better 
informed and build a profitable business.
http://opengazettes.com
While in some cases all the data a business uses will be 
open, often it will come from across the Data Spectrum.
[34]
 
For example, open data can be mixed with data shared by 
customers to make analysis more relevant to them. Value 
arises not from the data’s content, but from combining 
different data sources in a way that meets the 
customer’s needs. 
That said, profitable business models do not rely on selling 
access to data. In many cases, startups and SMEs are 
looking to disrupt markets by publishing open data. 
By publishing open data – sometimes just cleaning, 
enhancing and re-publishing existing open data – they can 
encourage further open innovation. In doing so, they can 
directly benefit, principally by creating an ecosystem of 
companies that rely on their data, build complementary 
services and are potential customers for their paid-for 
Products and services provided 
by businesses often rely on 
various data sources to be 
combined in innovative ways 
to    help customers solve 
problems.
This variety can be a necessity of the sector or subject of 
the data, but it can also arise from the terms under which 
the business has access to the data.

reasons but to help the data better meet their own needs, 
without the need to build and maintain their own 
infrastructure. Examples of this collaborative approach are 
not limited to startups or SMEs, for example Facebook uses, 
and improves, OpenStreetMap to support their own 
services,
[37]
 while reducing costs that would be associated 
with maintaining their own mapping data infrastructure.
We also asked businesses what types of open data they 
were using. While 29% said they were only using data on 
only one topic, on average businesses were using data on 
four different topics with 16% were using data on eight or 
more different topics.
Combining open, shared and closed 
data sources
We asked companies about the types of products and 
services they were developing. 43% were providing a 
product/platform for analysing, visualising and/or interpreting 
customer data and 29% a product/platform for hosting, 
managing and/or publishing customer data. Only 5% of all 
companies who were developing these types of services 
were not using open data; in most cases the value was 
unlocked by combining shared customer data with open 
data sources.
services. TransportAPI provide an early example of this 
model, aggregating and cleaning various open transport 
data feeds,
[35]
 leading to the development of companies 
like CityMapper.
[36]
Using multiple open data sources
We asked businesses what open data sources they used. 
87% of companies using open data used data published by 
government. Over 55% were using open data published by 
other businesses despite there being much less available 
than public sector data – clearly indicating the usefulness of 
private sector data. Of the companies using open data, 74% 
were using data published by two or more types of publisher, 
with 11% using data from all five sources, demonstrating the 
variety of sources being used. 
In hindsight, one type of open data publisher that was not 
clearly represented by this question was community data 
initiatives. These were specifically named by users: 
OpenStreetMap was mentioned by 13% of users, while 
others mentioned initiatives such as DBpedia, Geonames 
and Wikidata. 47% of companies using data noted that they 
used data either published by individuals, the third sector, 
or both, which could refer to these types of initiatives. 
In turn, several companies were contributing to these 
‘community’ initiatives. They were not doing this for altruistic

Targeting customers and    markets
All the responding companies were targeting organisations 
as customers, and of the respondents, 93% were targeting 
businesses and 38% were exclusively targeting businesses. 
While 52% were targeting public sector clients, only 7% 
were exclusively targeting governments. 38% were 
targeting individual end users but all of these were also 
targeting businesses, while some also targeted other types 
of customer.
The companies were also targeting their products across a 
wide range of industries beyond the ‘tech sector’. Contrary to 
expectation, only 33% of companies were targeting the 
‘data/technology’ sector and only 3% were exclusively 
targeting this sector. Over a third of companies – 36% – were 
only targeting one industry or sector, while 46% were 
targeting between two and four industries. The diversity 
demonstrates the role of open data across a range of sectors, 
and that value can be created across sectors and not only by 
targeting other businesses in the same sector. 
Startups and SMEs are using 
open data to create successful 
B2B services and products for 
the third sector and academia. 
Products and services built on open data are not limited to 
consumer-facing applications or services that enable 
governments to make better use of data, but are are creating 
value in a wide variety of situations and sectors. Increasingly, 
startups and SMEs are creating successful business-to-
business (B2B) services built with open data, along with 
products targeted at the third sector and academia. 
Services built on 
open data have 
wide-reaching value
Case study: urban Data Analytics (uDA)
Founded in Madrid, Spanish startup urban Data Analytics 
(uDA) offers access to a huge amount of high-quality, accurate 
and real-time real estate data.
[40]
 The company is using this 
data to help people make informed decisions around buying, 
renting, selling, investing or refinancing properties. 
uDA’s central product is the Real Estate Dynamics System, 
a   database which provides people with access to real-time 
estate data. The company creates this database using open 
and shared data sources, which are classified into 160 sets 
and divided into six categories: Urban People (eg. population, 
education), Urban Economics (employment, production), 
Urban Shape (compactness, housing density), Urban System 
(parks and gardens, road networks), Urban Environment (noise 
level, sun exposure) and Urban Move (private transport 
network, time access parking areas). The business then 
uses georeferenced data within these categories to create 
visualisations, such as maps, charts or infographics, 
and analyse the results according to identified indicators.
The right combination of open data has enabled uDA to create 
a service that is bringing transparency to estates data. This is 
helping people make better property decisions faster.

Case study: InSymbio
Research shows that 33 million tons of bio-based waste are 
produced in the EU per year. InSymbio is a business-to-
business environmental engineering company which uses 
open data, such as the EUROSTAT database, to help decrease 
bio-based waste. It does this by informing businesses about 
how bio-based residues could be treated and how their use 
can increase revenues up to 40%.
The company are raising awareness through a digital platform 
where businesses can find the best opportunities to convert 
and reuse bio-based residues and by-products. They see 
waste as a resource out of place. The platform links the 
Agriculture and Forestry sectors with bio-economy businesses 
and those producing fuels, fibres, food, feed and chemicals. 
By connecting these actors and allowing one company’s 
waste to become another company’s raw material, InSymbio 
hope to reduce biological waste and promote environmental 
sustainability.

Conclusion:  
open is the future  
of business
The movement towards open 
data allows businesses to 
experiment with new, innovative 
business models.
Businesses are increasingly recognising the opportunities to 
build and enhance their value propositions with open data. 
Beyond access to new, cheap data sources, the movement 
towards open data is allowing businesses to experiment with 
new, innovative business models. 
The ODINE programme has given new startups and SMEs 
the opportunity to explore how these propositions and 
models might function. The lessons they have learnt – along 
with other startups and SMEs in the ODI global network – 
can help lower the barriers for others by sharing what has 
been working.
These lessons are not exhaustive – there are plenty of 
potential business models which are yet to be fully utilised 
and tested. Some of the models and lessons might apply in 
certain contexts or circumstances, in others they might not. 
Business models that involve open data are still in early 
stages of development, but what is clear is the potential value 
of open data to business. 
Trying, testing and experimenting with these models will 
enable startups and SMEs to leverage this value. Open data 
creates a unique opportunity for businesses to create growth, 
extract value and ensure sustainability while defining the 
successful business models of the future.
Methodology 
This report is based on research done as part of the ODINE 
programme.
[43]
 The goal of that research was to explore the 
business models of ODINE-funded companies and use them 
to help inform wider research into open data and business 
models. In order to do this, we chose to develop a survey 
based on the existing literature exploring business models. 
This short survey (available under an open licence) was then 
distributed amongst the 57 ODINE-funded companies 
between November 2016 and January 2017, with a response 
rate of 74%. The results were then analysed with a view to 
understanding how the companies operate. The tables of the 
results developed from the analysis are also made available 
alongside this research under an open licence.
Because of the constraints placed on the analysis, and with 
the aim of stimulating further research, companies were able 
to opt into releasing their answers as open data – either with 
their company identified or not, with 90% opting to have their 
data released. This data is made available via the ODI Lab’s 
Octopub tool, under an open licence.
