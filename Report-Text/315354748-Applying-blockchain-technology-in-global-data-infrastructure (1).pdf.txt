Executive summary
Blockchains, or ‘distributed ledgers’, are part of a new area of technology that is generating a 
lot of interest. They have the potential to become an important component of our global data 
infrastructure.
In this report, we present an overview of Blockchain technology and issues that come with it, 
for a non-technical audience who seek to understand the potential of distributed ledgers and 
blockchains in a commercial or policy context. We focus on non-financial use cases, both to 
avoid duplication of other work and to explore the wider impact of the technology.
Some of the key areas covered in this report are:
 the basics of blockchain and distributed ledger technology
 the landscape of use cases and applications
  how blockchains will need to link into our global data infrastructure
 how blockchains will need to grow and scale over time
 the potential privacy implications for personal data in distributed ledgers, and 
the risk of adding personal information to blockchain systems without careful 
design
 a practical exploration of building a blockchain system for data storage
We conclude that distributed ledgers are a potentially important area of technology, but that 
we  must  avoid  being  swept  up  by  ‘blockchain  hype’,  and  remember  to  focus  on  solid  user  
needs first, before we choose the technology that we will use.
We  recommend  further  that  this  is  best  done  by  organisations  convening  across  sectors  to  
identify common data infrastructure needs.

Introduction
Data is essential for the modern age; it is infrastructure for the whole economy. It underpins 
public service transformation, business innovation and democratic engagement. It connects 
sectors. 
Data infrastructure includes technology, processes and organisations. The Open Data Institute 
(ODI) is in the process of developing its design principles for strengthening the data infrastructure 
we rely on to build tools, products and services that benefit everyone. Sometimes we talk 
about our data infrastructure like we do our road infrastructure: roads help you get from A to 
B – data helps you get to a decision. Sometimes we need a super highway or a motorway; 
at other times a country lane. Data infrastructure needs to be as reliable as necessary and as 
open as possible.
A new class of data infrastructure technologies has recently emerged, known as ‘distributed 
ledgers’. Blockchains are one specific type of technology in that domain, and though far from 
the only type, they are receiving a lot of attention. Blockchain technology emerged from the 
digital currency Bitcoin, and has been hailed as a revolutionary step forward for data storage 
and the decentralisation of computer systems.
With the support of Deutsche Bank, the ODI has been exploring emerging data infrastructure 
technologies – including distributed ledgers and blockchains – their potential and the issues 
they  might  bring.  We  have  explored  the  technology  landscape,  raised  questions  based  on  
our recent work on data infrastructure and personal data, and begun to investigate technical 
implementation.  Each  of  these  activities  has  led  to  new  insights  into  the  current  state,  and  
potential, of these technologies.
While there are many technologies relevant to data infrastructure, we have focused recently on 
blockchains because of the hype surrounding them, and a concern that it may lead to negative 
outcomes if they are used in the wrong ways.
VISIBILITY

Technology Trigger
Trough of Disillusionment
Slope of Enlightenment
Peak of Inflated Expectations
Plateau of Productivity
“Gartner Hype Cycle” 

4  |  Open Data Institute 2016  |  Applying blockchain technology in global data infrastructure  
Many technologies go through a similar hype cycle; the “peak of inflated expectations” can 
lead to the “trough of disillusionment”, before eventually we reach the “plateau of productivity” 
(Gartner,  1995).  Blockchains  and  distributed  ledgers  are  definitely  on  the  upwards  slope 
towards the peak, and in our work we hope to help accelerate through the cycle, and rather 
than increasing the height of the peak, to instead raise the floor of the trough. Good ideas die 
in the trough, and we want to help those good ideas survive through the cycle to success. 
It is only together that we will be able to answer the question of whether blockchains are “as 
fundamental for forward progress in society as the Magna Carta or the Rosetta Stone” (Swan, 
2015,  p.  viii),  whether  they  are  irrevocably  bound  to  the  “failed  Bitcoin  experiment”  (Hearn,  
2016), or whether the truth lies somewhere in between. 
In this report, we hope to help the reader form their own opinion on that emerging question, 
and provide a roadmap for further exploration.
The foundations of blockchain technology
Blockchains provide a way to store information so that many people can see it, keep a copy of 
it, and add to it. Once added, it is very difficult to remove information. This can reinforce trust 
in a blockchain’s content.
At its heart, a blockchain is simply a new kind of database, with a unique set of properties. 
Rather than being stored in a single location, this database is shared across the Internet, with 
many people holding a copy of it. The synchronisation between all these different copies – 
so  that  there  is  still  a  single  recognised  truth  –  is  one  of  the  unique  aspects  of  blockchain  
technology.
In  his  article  ‘Avoiding  the  pointless  blockchain  project,’  Greenspan  (2015)  outlines  these  
properties as follows:
 Shared read: blockchains are a structured data store that many people can read
 Shared write: as well as read, many people can write data into the database
 Absence of trust: the different writers do not have to trust each other not to 
manipulate the shared database state (i.e. you cannot change information I have 
added)
 Disintermediation: there is no need for a trusted intermediary to enforce access 
control (or none is available)
 Transaction interaction: records in the database depend on and link to each 
other
 Validation rules: the rules around database transactions are well-defined, 
such that anyone with a copy of the database can validate that it has been 
maintained correctly

5  |  Open Data Institute 2016  |  Applying blockchain technology in global data infrastructure  
If  an  application  does  not  need  to  meet  all  the  above  criteria,  then  it  does  not  require  a  
blockchain  solution;  there  are  much  more  mature  technologies  available  that  meet  many  of  
the  above  criteria  (including  traditional  databases)  and  can  also  support  distributed  service  
and organisational models. 
How data is stored in a blockchain
The fact that writers do not need to trust one another not to change information in a blockchain 
is down to how data is stored in the system. A blockchain stores a series of transactions – 
which can be data of any sort – in blocks, which get added one after the other in a continuous 
chain. Importantly, blockchains are considered append-only, or immutable, data stores. Data 
can be added to the chain, but because each item depends on the one before it, data cannot 
be removed or changed without recalculating every subsequent transaction. 
Because  of  this,  once  data  is  embedded  in  a  blockchain  it  cannot  be  altered  without  that  
change  being  detected  and  potentially  rejected  by  the  other  nodes  in  the  network.  This  is  
useful for data that users need to trust, because it provides a guarantee that the data has not 
been changed since it was put in the blockchain, but also has other implications, which we 
discuss below.
Blockchain distribution and data consensus
The disintermediation property arises because blockchains are distributed; there is no central 
storage location, no ‘primary’ copy. Blockchains are maintained by a peer-network of nodes; 
every  node  has  a  copy  of  the  blockchain  and  has  equal  authority  to  add  to  it.  Every  node  
publishes that data for other nodes to pick up and use.
The size of the network is important, and ensures the immutability of the database. A single 
node could change historical transactions and recreate a valid blockchain, but because other 
nodes in the network check the data before they accept it, it becomes impossible for a single 
node to make a historical change. More than 50% of the network needs to agree on ‘the truth’ 
for  it  to  be  accepted.  Conversely,  there  is  a  danger  that  if  more  than  50%  of  the  nodes  (or  
‘miners’, in Bitcoin parlance) decide to change history, they can.
As new blocks may be added on the end of the chain by many nodes at once, blockchains 
need a resolution mechanism to decide which block is accepted by the network. Bitcoin uses a 
‘proof of work’ algorithm, where nodes must prove they have solved a complex cryptographic 
puzzle, purely as a way of deciding which node gets to add its data first. Other systems use 
different methods such as the ‘proof of stake’ algorithm, which requires that nodes prove 
they own a certain amount of an asset, such as the cryptocurrency of the system. Choosing a 
resolution mechanism for a blockchain can greatly affect the scalability of the system and how 
much energy it uses, particularly as ‘proof of work’ algorithms require a lot of computing power.

6  |  Open Data Institute 2016  |  Applying blockchain technology in global data infrastructure  
‘Distributed ledgers’, ‘blockchains’, or ‘the blockchain’?
Confusing  terminology  is  often  used  around  blockchains,  which  are  themselves  a  type  of  a  
more general ‘distributed ledger technology’ (DLT).
Some  people  have  a  tendency  to  talk  about  ‘the  blockchain’,  which  normally  implies  the  
blockchain that underpins Bitcoin, as opposed to ‘a blockchain’.
The ODI uses blockchain terminology as follows:
 Distributed ledger technology: the concept of a distributed shared database of 
transactions
 A blockchain: a particular implementation of a distributed ledger system that 
uses the same basic technical architecture as Bitcoin, but could be independent 
of that system
 The Bitcoin blockchain: the blockchain that runs the Bitcoin digital currency. In 
the wider world, this is often confusingly referred to simply as “the blockchain”, 
but we avoid that usage
Permissions
While  classical  blockchains  (such  as  Bitcoin)  are  public  and  allow  anyone  to  write  to  them,  
some distributed ledgers work differently. Distributed ledgers can be classified as:
 Public: anyone may have a copy of the database and anyone may write to 
it. This is the classic Bitcoin-style public ledger. Sometimes referred to as 
‘unpermissioned’ or ‘permissionless’
 Permissioned: anyone may have a copy of the database, but only certain 
parties may write to it – an audit log for government information, for example
 Private: only certain authorised users have access to the database, whether for 
reading or writing – a blockchain used internally within an organisation’s firewall, 
for example
The  concepts  of  permissioned  and  private  blockchains  are  controversial  in  the  blockchain  
development community, as they may reintroduce trusted intermediaries into the system and 
therefore undermine one of the unique aspects of the technology.
Permission types in blockchains are aligned with the ‘closed / shared / open’ components of 
the ODI’s Data Spectrum, which classifies data by who has access to it.

7  |  Open Data Institute 2016  |  Applying blockchain technology in global data infrastructure  
Closed  data  is  only  available  to  a  single  individual  or  organisation  (similar  to  a  private  
blockchain); shared  data  is  shared  under  various  permission  methods  with  a  limited  group  
(similar to a permissioned blockchain); and open data is freely available to all to access, use 
and share (similar to a public blockchain).
The three generations of blockchain technology
Blockchain  technologies  and  their  applications  generally  fall  into  one  of  three  generations,  
defined by their use and capabilities:
 Digital currencies (Blockchain 1.0): storing and executing transactions carried 
out in purely digital currencies (i.e. Bitcoin)
 Coloured coins (Blockchain 2.0): using small Bitcoin transactions to represent 
assets that are transferrable but not digitally stored on a blockchain, such as 
real estate or diamonds
 Smart contracts (Blockchain 3.0): transactions store executable code which 
runs when certain criteria are fulfilled, allowing complex behaviour and fully 
distributed applications (Dapps)

Section summary
 Blockchains (or distributed ledgers) are a new type of database 
with unique properties
 Blockchains suit applications where multiple readers and writers 
need to use the database without a trusted third-party
 Data stored in a blockchain cannot be changed afterwards
 Public, permissioned and private blockchains are differentiated 
by who can read or write data within them
 Smart contract systems enable blockchains to run executable 
code, allowing much more complex behaviour
The technology landscape
The  recent  explosion  of  interest  in  blockchains  and  distributed  ledgers  has  created  much  
speculation on the application of these technologies. While there are many ideas being brought 
to the fore, there seem to be few actual implementations being referenced. 
As part of our research, we explored this rapidly evolving space to pull out tangible examples 
of tools, technologies and applications currently in operation. 
Our efforts focused primarily beyond financial applications. Because of the association with 
Bitcoin, there has already been a great deal of research on blockchains for cryptocurrencies 
which we did not want to replicate. We also focused on finding applications that illustrated the 
use of the technology in solving real problems and examined a variety of tools that aimed to 
make the underlying technologies more accessible to developers. 
Given the rapid growth in this field, this section only captures a snapshot of the activity that 
was being undertaken in early 2016. It should however serve as an illustration of the maturity 
of the field and a guide to potential applications.
Trends and observations
From our landscape research, we were able to distinguish a number of interesting trends and 
observations. 

9  |  Open Data Institute 2016  |  Applying blockchain technology in global data infrastructure  
The baseline technology is unclear
Our first observation is that the baseline technology underpinning different tools and solutions 
for  blockchains  is  often  difficult  to  understand.  For  instance,  in  many  cases  it  is  hard  to 
distinguish between the use of ‘a blockchain’ versus ‘the Bitcoin blockchain’. This indicates 
that the technology stack for distributed technologies is still very fluid and in the process of 
being defined. 
The  fluidity  of  the  technology  stack  presents  further  issues  in  classifying  any  particular 
solutions as either tools, technologies or applications. For instance, Bitcoin is an application 
of blockchain technology, but it is also being used as a platform on which other applications 
are built. 
Emerging platforms
At the current stage of development, platform technologies have not yet fully emerged. Many 
blockchain systems are bespoke, and combine both platform and application functions. As 
the field matures, commoditised platforms that allow applications to converge on a common, 
underlying technology stack are likely to appear.
Some of the most interesting applications, at least from a technical perspective, are those that 
use multiple distributed technologies and blockchain implementations in a single service. One 
example of this is Alexandria,
2
 a system designed to allow users to distribute digital content. 
It  uses  Bitcoin  to  handle  payment,  Florincoin
3
  (an  alternative  cryptocurrency)  to  create  a  
searchable  index,  and  the  InterPlanetary  File  System
4
  or  ‘IPFS’  (a  distributed  hash  table  or  
DHT) for content storage and distribution. 
Such emerging hybrid stacks show that complex services can be entirely implemented in a 
shared, distributed manner. We find one promising stack to be the combination of Ethereum
5
  
for the application or logic layer, IPFS for bulk storage, and BigchainDB
6
 for database storage. 
This  shows  the  beginning  of  a  true  platform  ecosystem  mirroring  the  common  LAMP

web stack.

The blockchain field is focused more on technology than  
real-world problems
Startups  working  with  blockchains  tend  to  be  highly  focused  around  technology.  Many  
distributed technology startups begin by laying out their technical vision, rather than focusing 
first on an end-user need.
Many blockchain solutions are also related to other disruptive and emerging trends in the tech 
sector, such as the Internet of Things and the sharing economy. The focus on technology over 
real-world problems is a common feature in those areas as well, and can be compounded by 
the combination.
Existing applications of blockchain technology 
As part of our research into distributed ledgers, we compiled a list of the tools, technologies 
and applications that we looked into.
8
  
From ‘marriage on the blockchain’ (Woods, 2015) to ‘AI gladiators’ (Borah, 2015), blockchain 
technologies are being experimented with in many different ways. In a crowded field – where 
many aim to capitalise on associated hype – it can be hard to identify useful applications of 
blockchain and distributed technologies that might have a lasting effect. 
We have identified several categories of notable applications. These are generally focused 
around a real-world problem that requires the unique properties of the technology. The best 
examples are from organisations that were committed to solving a problem before they adopted 
blockchains as a possible solution, as opposed to many who attempt to fit the problem to 
the technology.
The following sections identify the areas we think are worth watching, along with examples of 
organisations in the space.
Document and Intellectual Property verification 
The following services are designed to prove the existence of digital documents by recording 
a unique identifier and timestamp in public blockchains. 
 SealX and GeniusX: contract notary services and IP certification systems  
(bitproof.io)
 Blocksign: a document verification service (blocksign.com)
 Factom: a service for distributed record storage (factom.org)

11  |  Open Data Institute 2016  |  Applying blockchain technology in global data infrastructure  
Monitoring supply chains
The following services aim to improve supply-chain transparency and efficiency by tracking 
materials  and  products  through  the  production  process.  How  physical  products  are  reliably  
linked to digital assets is an open question.
 EverLedger: stores records of diamonds to prevent insurance fraud and 
diamond smuggling (everledger.io)
 Provenance: tracking supply chain provenance (provenance.org)
 Skuchain: tracking supply chain provenance, especially for food (skuchain.com)
Building a peer-to-peer economy
The  following  services  aim  to  automate  various  sharing  economy  transactions  using  smart  
contracts, without the need for centralised platforms.
 Slock.it: a service for renting, selling and sharing things that can be locked; 
combining IoT with blockchain (slock.it)
 Airlock.me: a decentralised electronic security service offering keyless access 
protocols for smart property (airlock.me)
 Lazooz: a decentralised transportation platform for ride-sharing (lazooz.org)
 WeiFund: a crowdfunding and equity platform based on Ethereum (weifund.io)
Governance
The  following  services  aim  to  use  smart  contracts  to  inform  decision-making  processes,   
and  in  some  cases  create  Decentralised  Autonomous  Organisations  (DAOs)  or  even  
decentralised nations.
 Colony: a tool to help organise distributed, democratic company-like entities or 
organisations (colony.io)
 Freecoin: an alternative currency for democratic social organisations  
(freecoin.ch)
 BoardRoom: a service that organises decision-making processes  
(boardroom.to)
 BitNation: a collaborative platform for governance for organisations and even 
virtual nations (bitnation.co)

12  |  Open Data Institute 2016  |  Applying blockchain technology in global data infrastructure  
Digital content distribution
The following services aim to provide a means to distribute digital content equitably – whether 
for IP protection, or fair remuneration – in a way that does not rely on centralised platforms.
 ALEXANDRIA: a standard allowing users to distribute digital content  
(blocktech.com)
 UjoMusic: a service for distributing creative digital products, such as music, 
focused on generating greater transparency, fairness and profitability  
(ujomusic.com)
 Blockai: a digital asset distribution service (blockai.com)
False promises
While there are promising applications as identified above, a great many of the ideas out 
there are ‘vapourware’, with no viable implementation or model. For instance, development on 
Honduras’ land registry, which is being turned into a distributed ledger by Factom, has stalled 
with no working system (Rizzo, 2015). This is particularly important, as this example is used 
repeatedly to show that blockchains can be useful in traditional government applications, but 
has not yet shown any results.
There are also many instances of old ideas being brought back to life with an application of new 
technology sheen. For instance, tracking benefit payments and how they are spent is a policy 
idea that has been proposed and rejected in the past, but is now reappearing with blockchains. 
Many such projects failed for good reasons in the past, and the addition of blockchains will not 
change those reasons, which is more often social or cultural than technological.
Section summary
 The distributed ledger technology stack is still emerging, with 
unclear boundaries between platforms and applications
 Many blockchain applications are technology-centric rather than 
focused on user needs
 While there are good examples of blockchains being used to 
build useful services, they are currently in the minority
 Interested parties must be alert to blockchain hype and myths 
when surveying the landscape, and should focus on those 
applications solving real problems

13  |  Open Data Institute 2016  |  Applying blockchain technology in global data infrastructure  
Scaling and linking blockchains
Blockchains  are  emerging  from  their  origins  in  cryptocurrencies  and  being  explored  as  a  
mechanism  for  storing  data  of  other  kinds.  We  are  very  early  in  our  understanding  of  when  
and how best to use blockchain technology. We need to anticipate and plan for what happens 
when blockchains scale from low levels of use to potential ubiquity for other applications, like 
recording  marriages  (Alexander,  2014),  registering  land  ownership  (van  Wirdum,  2015)  and  
maintaining supply-chain provenance (Provenance, 2015).
Blockchains  are  maintained  by  a  distributed  network  of  nodes:  computers  that  store  the  
blockchains and may add data to them. There are drivers for having a few blockchains that are 
each maintained by a large number of nodes and for having many blockchains that are each 
maintained by a small number of nodes. It is likely it will end up somewhere in the middle. The 
suitable number of blockchains needed to support the applications that use them will change 
over  time.  We  have  to  ensure  that  it  is  possible  to  adjust:  to  split  blockchains  or  to  merge  
blockchains as required, and to migrate data between them.
What are the drivers for having fewer blockchains?
Blockchains are attractive as a data store because their distributed nature makes them robust 
and tamper-proof. Robustness ensures that the data is always available. A blockchain being 
tamper-proof guarantees data integrity; even if some nodes are compromised, the other nodes 
will not accept changes they make to the blockchain.
A  blockchain  that  is  maintained  by  a  single  node  could  be  struck  by  a  hardware  failure,  or  
could rewind and rewrite the blockchain it is maintaining without detection.
Blockchains that are only maintained by small numbers of nodes can get into situations where 
the majority of the network is owned by a single organisation or cartel. This happened with 
the GHash Bitcoin mining pool in 2014 (Hern, 2014), and was the reason behind Onename’s 
recent migration from Namecoin to the Bitcoin blockchain (Onename, 2015). When more than 
half a blockchain is owned by a single organisation, it is possible that they can collaborate to 
alter the content of the blockchain or to accept invalid transactions.
The fact that small networks of nodes undermine the utility of a blockchain is a driver towards 
having a few, large-scale blockchains maintained by many nodes.

14  |  Open Data Institute 2016  |  Applying blockchain technology in global data infrastructure  
What are the drivers for having more blockchains?
The size of a blockchain grows over time because it is an append-only data store: you can add 
data to a blockchain, but you can never remove it.
At the time of publication, the Bitcoin blockchain is around 70GB in size. It has been growing 
steadily  by  about  2.5GB/month  (though  that  rate  is  increasing).  With  a  limit  of  1MB/block  
and one block every 10 minutes, the maximum rate of increase in size will be just over 4GB/
month. While there is work underway to change this, the choice of size is controversial and the 
outcome unknown in the long-term.
The  Bitcoin  blockchain  is  relatively  small,  as  transactions  take  up  very  little  data.  Other  
applications  for  blockchains  may  require  more  storage,  or  a  speedier  rate  of  growth  (larger  
blocks and/or more frequent addition of blocks to the chain).
Every node in a blockchain network needs to be able to store and process the entirety of the 
blockchain.  Blockchains  that  are  used  by  lots  of  applications  will  be  large  in  size.  The  vast  
majority of data within a blockchain supporting multiple applications will be irrelevant to the 
application any particular node is interested in. Some nodes might only be interested in land 
registry data, some only in statements of copyright ownership.
Large blockchains require nodes that are interested in a given application to take on all the 
data from other applications using the blockchain. They might hesitate not only because of 
size but due to ethical concerns about the data those blockchains contain. These are drivers 
towards having more, smaller and more specialised blockchains.
Linking blockchains
To find the balance between a few large and many small blockchains, blockchains will need 
to be able to split and merge over time, and for this to work, they will need to be able to refer 
to each other.
It is also important that new data infrastructure, built on blockchains, is compatible with the 
Web we have already. We will need to be able to link to items in a blockchain from outside, 
on the wider Internet. After all, data is at its most useful when it can be referred to and linked. 
Therefore, transactions on blockchains should have stable URLs and an equivalent of HTTP 
redirection  to  point  to  updated  locations.  We  will  need  a  standardisation  effort  to  create 
standard URL schemes for blockchain transactions, if these systems are to link into our global 
data infrastructure.

15  |  Open Data Institute 2016  |  Applying blockchain technology in global data infrastructure  
Data standards and archiving
How  do  we  standardise  storage  in  systems  so  that  we  get  a  single  network  of  data,  as   
opposed  to  having  to  use  a  different  storage  system  every  time  we  want  a  new  type  of 
information? What are the data protocols for distributed storage? How do we talk about, and 
perhaps enforce, ownership and licensing?
Like  other  Internet  phenomena,  blockchains  should  be  automatically  archived  for  posterity.  
Whatever the archiving institution – whether the Internet Archive or something else – they will 
need to be able to discover the data that need archiving, automatically, and standards will be 
an important part of this.
Section summary
 Fewer, large blockchains will be more secure
 More small blockchains will be more scalable
 Blockchains will need to be able to split or merge over time to 
balance their size and security
 We need to create URL and related standards to link blockchains 
into our global data infrastructure

16  |  Open Data Institute 2016  |  Applying blockchain technology in global data infrastructure  
Privacy and security
The irreversibility and transparency of public blockchains mean they are probably unsuitable 
for personal data. We need to be careful when designing blockchain systems not to infringe 
on people’s privacy, and to account for a world in which we have doxing, identity theft and the 
right to be forgotten.
The examples in this section are not necessarily mentioned because anyone has suggested 
providing  these  kinds  of  data  in  blockchains.  But  blockchains  are  being  investigated  for  a  
range of purposes, across the Data Spectrum, and we need to explore their limits.
What irreversibility means for privacy
There are types of data for which the difficulty of change could lead to problems – particularly 
personal data.
For example, in the UK personal insolvency notices are published in the London Gazette when 
people are declared bankrupt. They are published in paper copies of the Gazette (which are 
relatively hard to get hold of or search) and published on the Web. Requests are sometimes 
made for notices to be removed from the website to avoid them being as easy to find, because:
 people do not want their personal insolvency to be known about (they may have 
a right for that event to be forgotten under the law)
  people have made a transition to a new gender; they may have a legal right for 
previous data to be altered to ensure it is interpreted according to their new 
gender
 the notice includes the current address of a person who is attempting to avoid 
an abuser, and thus the notice increases the risk of discovery and harm to that 
individual
It  is  easy  to  imagine  other  scenarios  where  blockchains  could  be  used  to  hold  data  about  
people that might seem innocuous at the time but where the situation changes such that data 
should no longer be held in the same way. For example, a recent change in UK law means that 
company  directors’  birth  dates  are  no  longer  published  by  Companies  House.
9
  Data  about  
people applying for planning applications, holders of licences and those in public office is 
routinely published and could change in similar ways.
Beyond government, blockchains offer a great opportunity for people to collaboratively create 
datasets in a peer network without a central authority. We can see the evidence of the demand 
for data rating teachers, about landlords, about where sexual offenders live – all of which 
would have a significant privacy impact if published (Neyfahk, 2015).

Arguably, we have a situation even now where once data is published on the Web, it can never 
truly be removed. Certainly removing a page from Google’s search results under a right to be 
forgotten does not actually remove it from the Web, rather it makes it harder to find. What is 
different about blockchains is that if a court were to attempt to legally compel the removal of 
data from them, it would be both hard to do and have very disruptive side-effects, which we 
explain in the next section.
Removing data from a blockchain
Imagine  a  blockchain  were  found  to  contain  the  names  and  addresses  of  children  at  risk  
of  abuse  (we  deliberately  pick  something  most  people  would  say  should  not  be  publicly  
available). To clear that data out, over half the nodes that maintain the blockchain would have 
to work together to rebuild the blockchain since that data was added. This process is similar to 
rebuilding from a backup: while being rebuilt, the blockchain would be rewound to a previous 
state, days or weeks or even more out of date. During this time (and rebuilding blockchains 
deliberately  takes  time),  the  data  would  not  be  up-to-date.  This  might  also  be  a  time  when  
unwanted changes to data that was trustworthy could creep in.
Alternatively,  a  court  could  try  to  compel  the  entire  set  of  nodes  to  be  shut  down.  Putting  
aside that nodes may reside in different legal jurisdictions, that would have huge practical 
implications. It would mean removing all the rest of the data held in the blockchain as well as 
the target of the order. Given the use of blockchains that people envisage often involves the 
same blockchain holding many types of data and supporting many types of applications, there 
is a real risk that, pragmatically, bad data simply has to continue to exist in order to prevent 
massive disruption to the provision of good data for other applications.
What transparency means for privacy
When new data is added to a blockchain, peers in the network check it to ensure it is valid, to 
avoid fraud by rogue nodes. The data that the peers need to check must be stored transparently 
in the blockchain.
Sometimes – as with Bitcoin – personal data is required in order to verify that a transaction in 
the blockchain is valid. For a node to check a Bitcoin transaction, it must have access to all 
previous transactions and be able to check that the person giving the Bitcoins actually has 
them to give. It must therefore be possible for any node to reconstruct the full financial history 
of every person exchanging Bitcoins: how many they have, where they got them from, and 
whom they spend them with.
This  is  intensely  personal  information,  highly  revealing  of  the  details  of  someone’s  life;  after  
all, would you publish all your bank statements on the Web? The only shield is the pseudo-
anonymity of the Bitcoin address, which is easily breached if the address is associated with 

18  |  Open Data Institute 2016  |  Applying blockchain technology in global data infrastructure  
a  donate  button  on  a  blog.  Those  who  trade  Bitcoins  are  therefore  advised  to  hold  several  
addresses and not to transfer Bitcoins between those accounts to avoid others linking them 
together. It is not clear how many Bitcoin holders are aware of this risk, and ‘security-through-
obscurity’ is well-known to be insufficient.
Some of the proposed uses for blockchain – such as to record auditable benefits payments – 
threaten to expose this kind of information about a much wider range of people, the benefits 
they receive and with whom they spend them.
Blockchains do not have to expose personal data directly to reveal private information about 
people. A blockchain recording visits to health practitioners (including midwives, mental health 
teams and AIDS clinics) does not need to include the entirety of someone’s health records to 
reveal information about them. Much like phone records (Mayer & Mutchler, 2014) or browsing 
histories, this metadata may be sufficient to reveal personal details.
Designing privacy-protecting blockchains
There are ways to design the content of blockchains and the network that supports them, that 
limit the level of disclosure that they entail.
First,  whereas  anyone  can  join  the  Bitcoin  blockchain,  it  is  possible  to  use  a  permissioned  
distributed ledger as a method of resolving conflicts within a peer-to-peer network of trusted 
nodes.  When  nodes  can  be  trusted,  they  can  control  what  becomes  public,  and  therefore  
hide data in the blockchain that should not be shared. The security of all the nodes in such a 
trusted network needs to be guaranteed as every node will have a copy of all the relevant data, 
and the network needs to be protected against spoofing, but, in general, if you have a trusted 
network many privacy issues are no more problematic than they are in centralised systems.
Second,  blockchains  could  be  used  purely  to  provide  a  timestamp  for  information  held  
elsewhere. Content that could require redactions in the future can be made available as usual 
on  the  Web,  with  transactions  in  the  blockchain  containing  simply  a  pointer  to  the  content  
and  its  hash.  If  the  content  needs  to  be  taken  down,  the  fact  that  the  content  existed  at  a  
given point in time could remain in the blockchain; the stored hash alone would not enable 
the reconstruction of the removed content. If the content needs to be changed, the existing 
hash would no longer match the content, so applications are able to detect that something 
has changed. If the changes are legitimate, the reasons for them could be stored in a later, 
overriding, transaction.
This pattern of using blockchains purely as a timestamping mechanism and not as a data store 
has the additional benefit of being more likely to scale in the face of large amounts of data needing 
to be recorded. On the other hand, it shifts the burden of robust, distributed data storage, which 
is one aspect of the interest in blockchains, to other protocols, whether the Web, BitTorrent, or 
IPFS. Projects that are focused on robust distributed storage might not need a blockchain at all.

19  |  Open Data Institute 2016  |  Applying blockchain technology in global data infrastructure  
Finally, it is possible to encrypt data stored within a blockchain. The main problem with this 
approach is that if the decryption key for encrypted data is ever made public, the encrypted 
content  is  readable  by  anyone  with  that  key;  there  is  no  way  of  encrypting  the  data  with  a  
different key once it is embedded within a blockchain. Conversely, if the key is ever lost, the 
data cannot be read. And there is the problem of sharing the key for the data amongst all those 
who legitimately need to be able to read it.
On  top  of  that,  a  well-used  blockchain  will  be  a  potentially  eternal  datastore,  and  over  a  
sufficiently  long  period  any  encryption  will  be  broken  whether  by  discovery  of  loopholes, 
backdoors, or the advent of new techniques such as quantum computing.
Regardless  of  the  approach  taken  to  designing  blockchains,  every  blockchain  contains  
transaction data. That data needs to be designed so that it is not disclosive in and of itself, 
which may be a tricky balance as that data might also be necessary to assess whether the 
transaction is valid and therefore prevent fraud or errors. Transactions should also be designed 
so that they cannot be used to add comments that might include personal data.
Blockchains are not necessarily bad for privacy; it all depends on how they are designed. As 
stated by Vitalik Buterin (2015): “blockchains do not solve privacy issues, and are an authenticity 
solution only”. Anyone experimenting in the area should be thinking through the implications. 
As the ICO’s guidance around privacy by design suggests, designers should be carrying out a 
privacy impact assessment or similar process up-front, to ensure that the transparency of the 
information stored in the blockchain does not infringe on people’s privacy. Unlike with other 
technologies, getting it wrong is really hard to reverse.
Section summary
 Immutable data storage in blockchains may be incompatible with 
legislation which requires changes to the “official truth”
 Once added, removing data from blockchains can be impractical 
and highly disruptive
 Even if personal data is not stored on a blockchain, metadata can 
be sufficient to reveal personal information
 Blockchains by themselves are not a solution for personal or 
private data
 Any encryption used is likely to be broken in the future
 Bad blockchain design decisions are very hard to reverse

Practical experimentation
During  early  2016,  the  ODI  Labs  team  carried  out  some  practical  exploration  of  blockchain  
technologies  and  how  they  could  be  applied  to  data  infrastructure.  This  was  done  in  order  
to  understand  the  technology  more  deeply,  but  also  to  drive  out  further  issues  through  
experimentation.
Creating a blockchain
The first step was to create a blockchain to experiment with. The team opted to build on 
Multichain,
10
  a  blockchain  software  toolkit  that  supports  Bitcoin  and  other  blockchains,  but  
adds support for metadata and custom assets. 
As software developers, it was reasonably simple to get a system up and running, although 
this would be confusing and difficult for anyone without technical experience. There is a clear 
need  for  user-friendly  prototyping  systems  so  that  non-technical  users  (for  instance  policy-
makers) can explore their own use cases.
Storing data on a blockchain
The team built a small open source software library
11
 around the blockchain that would allow 
arbitrary information to be stored with any transaction. In the standard Bitcoin-style system 
we were using, only a small amount of information can be stored with each transaction.
12
 The 
total amount of information that could actually be stored was only 640 bits per transaction. By 
comparison, a single tweet can hold up to around 2650 bits (Munroe, 2014).
One of the use cases in mind for this data storage was to be able to store a cryptographic hash 
of the contents of a URL. The hash is a “fingerprint” for the data pointed to by the URL; the 
data cannot be recovered from it, but a third party could use the hash to detect if the data has 
changed since the hash was created.
Auditing open data
The Government Digital Services in the UK has written about guaranteeing the integrity of a 
register (Potter, 2015), explaining how a distributed database could be used to check that an 
official register has not been tampered with. 
For  our  exploration,  we  decided  to  follow  the  example  proposed,  and  create  a  blockchain

version  of  the  Food  Standards  Agency  premises  ratings  dataset.  If  the  FSA  website  was  
compromised,  and  ratings  altered,  the  information  on  our  blockchain  –  which  could  not  be  
deleted or altered – could be used to detect the tampering. We successfully imported the full 
rating data (rather than just an audit hash) into the blockchain, storing the premises ID, along 
with the inspection date and rating.
Searching blockchains
While the team successfully stored open data in a blockchain, various issues emerged when 
trying to use the data. 
Firstly, finding a particular record is non-trivial. To find a particular food hygiene rating for a 
premise, we needed to carry out a brute-force search of the blockchain. Many search systems 
are available, and indeed there are many sites for searching and viewing the Bitcoin blockchain, 
which index the blockchain into a searchable database. The problem then becomes that you 
are now relying on the integrity of your search index to ensure you find the right information.
If the idea of the blockchain is to prevent centralisation (due to lack of trust or other reasons), 
we cannot trust search indexes maintained by others. In order to find anything, not only would 
each blockchain client have to have the entire blockchain stored, but also store (and update) 
a  search  index  built  from  it,  which  could  be  considerably  larger.  There  is  a  need  for  search  
indexing to be built into blockchain software if it is to be used for data.
Incentivising maintenance
The test blockchain we created consisted of only two nodes, mining and sending fake currency 
to  each  other.  The  key  to  the  integrity  of  blockchain  technology  is  its  decentralised  nature.  
Once  one  person  or  organisation  owns  the  majority  of  nodes  in  a  blockchain  network,  this  
integrity breaks down, as discussed earlier.
If  we  were  to  open  up  our  audit  blockchain  to  the  wider  public,  how  would  we  incentivise  
mining? With Bitcoin, once a miner adds new transactions to the blockchain, there is a fixed 
reward (currently 25 BTC, almost £7,500 in today’s exchange rate). As the size of the blockchain 
network increases, so does the computational power required to add new blocks (if using a 
‘proof of work’ algorithm); O’Dwyer and Malone (2014) have compared the electricity usage 
of the Bitcoin network to that of Ireland. As a result of this, and the rewards at stake, there are 
entire server farms devoted to Bitcoin mining.
Currently, the test blockchain we created is tiny, and a few well-intentioned people might be 
happy to mine it for free. However, as the blockchain grows, mining will get harder, and the 
worthless currency the blockchain ‘rewards’ miners with won’t help them cover the electricity 
bills the computation will end up costing them.

Section summary
 Simple prototyping tools are required so that non-technical users 
can explore blockchain use cases
 Only a very small amount of information can be encoded with 
each transaction in current blockchain software (including 
Bitcoin)
 Distributed search indexes will be required for trusted search of 
blockchain data, increasing the space requirements
Conclusions
Data is part of the infrastructure of the modern world. It is essential to the operation of society, 
and  it  is  vital  that  we  learn  how  to  build,  maintain  and  strengthen  our  data  infrastructure.  
Distributed  ledgers  are  a  potentially  important  technology  for  enabling  a  shared  data  
infrastructure, and are worthy of investigation.
However, new technologies always go through a hype cycle. The challenge at the beginning of 
that cycle is to identify the uses and applications that will stand the test of time. Blockchains 
are unusual in that mistakes made in early deployment could last a long time, and could cause 
significant damage, especially if deployed carelessly with personal data.
Blockchains  could  be  used  to  build  confidence  in  government  services  through  public 
auditability.  They  also  hold  great  potential  for  collaborative  maintenance  of  data  assets,  
enabling widely distributed data collection and publishing for applications such as supply-chain 
information. Smart contracts also have promise for the future across many application areas.
However, in our research we have seen many cases where people attempt to bolt old, failed 
or impossible policy and business ideas onto the new technology, or to unnecessarily reinvent 
things that work perfectly well. Many other cases show familiar organisational models being 
rebuilt as permissioned ledgers based on blockchain technologies, but this ignores the core 
innovation of the technology and its promised transformation.
We have seen many ideas that would put new personal data into blockchains but learnt that, 
if misused, this will create significant new privacy issues. The core problems that blockchain 
technologies help to address – of distributed maintenance by collaborating organisations – is 
of growing importance and an area that shows some promise, but few are considering it.
Success in data infrastructure design will come from convening sectors (such as finance, 

23  |  Open Data Institute 2016  |  Applying blockchain technology in global data infrastructure  
agriculture,  or  healthcare),  identifying  common  challenges  and  then  determining  which  
technology approaches – whether blockchains or not – are the most appropriate in helping to 
address them. 
Blockchain technology is a new and powerful tool in our toolbox. We must use it when it is the 
right tool for the job at hand.
Recommendations
 Organisations must remember to start with user needs, rather 
than preselecting technologies that may or not be appropriate
 Organisations considering blockchain technology should be 
aware that there are many other distributed technologies 
available, and it is important to assess needs properly in order to 
arrive at the right technology choice
 Organisations should convene across sectors to identify 
common data infrastructure needs, and then decide how those 
can best be met and which technologies should be used
 When experimenting with blockchain technologies, researchers 
and developers must be aware of the privacy implications of 
storing information in a public immutable database; what is done 
cannot be easily undone
