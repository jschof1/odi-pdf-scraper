Bus Open Data
Making open 
data work for 
everyone
4
Open data is enabling a transformation in how 
we travel
The way we travel is undergoing profound changes. 
On-demand services and real-time journey planners 
are empowering consumers to make the best choices 
for their needs and circumstances, saving them time, 
hassle and money. This is being enabled by open 
data –data that is available to everyone to access, 
use and share.
In the longer run, we expect open data to enable the 
full range of transport services to be fully integrated, 
through ‘mobility as a service’, allowing seamless 
payment and booking, and greater choice and 
convenience. Bus services will need to feature in this 
transport future. They already play an important part 
in the transport system, providing access to services 
in local communities, and offering economic, 
environmental and social benefits.
Open data is already being adopted by the bus 
industry
Consumers are increasingly using data to make 
informed choices across a range of sectors. In the 
bus industry, open data is enabling new business 
opportunities, with examples seen around the 
country. The problem is that the progress in opening 
up bus data is not happening fast enough, or 
consistently. 
Government wants to support the move to Bus 
Open Data
The Government is working with industry to pursue 
open data. A key part of this is the Bus Services Act, 
which came into force in April 2017. This enables 
Government to set legislation which will require 
information from all bus operators on timetables, 
fares and routes.
Bus open data will deliver a range of benefits 
to passengers, operators, local authorities, and 
the wider population
The aim of bus open data is to provide greater 
convenience for travellers and to facilitate bus use. 
This will deliver benefits to operators, who have seen 
falling demand in some areas over recent years. It will 
also help local authorities with planning of public 
transport provision, and enable new business models 
and innovation by opening data up to anyone who 
needs it. This includes app developers, who can 
develop products for passengers to help with journey 
planning. 
We need collaboration to open up bus data
This document sets out the case for bus open data 
and calls for collaboration between Government, 
operators, local authorities, passenger groups and 
technology companies to work together. Each group 
will have a role to play in opening up bus data to best 
serve all parties and deliver the widest benefits.

Executive 
summary

Bus Open Data can make 
journeys better for passengers, 
address challenges in the 
industry and achieve better 
outcomes.
The role of
the bus
Benefits to 
everybody
Collaborative 
approach
Buses provide vital services 
for local communities and 
deliver substantial 
socioeconomic benefits. 
However the industry is 
facing a challenge of falling 
demand in some areas, and 
is behind other modes on 
fare and timetable data.
Passengers want the bus sector to 
open up its data. This is already 
happening, but it is not consistent, 
reliable and widespread. This is why 
Government is setting regulations on 
bus open data.
We need all parties to work together 
and adopt the required changes to 
facilitate bus open data and to:
We are moving to an on-demand and 
more convenient transport system. This 
innovation will be driven by open data –
data that is available to everyone to 
access, use and share. 
Open data in the bus industry will support 
increased patronage and offer benefits to 
passengers, operators, local authorities 
and wider technology companies.

Bus Open Data
Putting the 
passenger first
7
We want a mobility ecosystem 
that delivers seamless 
intermodal transportation faster, 
cheaper, cleaner, more 
responsive and safer than today. 
This will be enabled by open 
data on fares and journeys 
across all modes –data that is 
available to everyone to access, 
use and share
1
. 
Passengers need all transport options
2,3
Different transport modes have different characteristics (such as cost, speed, comfort, flexibility, availability and accessibility).
These characteristics are suited to different types of journey and passenger, which means that an efficient, effective and 
equitable transport system requires a blend of transport provision.
Data will play a key role in enabling lower-hassle transport services
2
A key enabler for effective transport integration is consistent, secure, real-time and open data on routes and fares.
Transport integration will also need the widespread penetration of smartphones on 3G/4G/5G networks, high levels of 
connectivity, and cashless payment.
Passengers need these transport options to be easy to use, integrated and responsive
2,3
Today’s passengers have to locate, book, and pay for each mode of transportation separately, often without complete or real-
time fare and journey data. 
In the longer term we are moving to ‘Mobility as a Service’, where users can receive real-time data, and plan and book door-
to-door trips using a single app. 
Case study: Whim
4
Since 2016, Helsinki residents have been able to use an app called Whim to plan and pay for all modes of public and private 
transportation within the city. In 2017, the Whim app launched a beta version in the UK (currently available in the West Midlands to 
access bus, tram and taxi). It will shortlylaunch the app fully, providing access to a range of transport services including bus, tram, 
train, taxi, bicycle, car hire and others.
There are many apps which make it easier to book and plan journeys
“We want to prove that we can beat the 
service level of a car. Or at least be 
comparable to it. We want to show that 
people want it, not just that we can do it”

The context

Bus Open Data
The bus sector 
today
9
Buses are the most-used form of 
public transport. They serve a vital 
role within communities, 
connecting people to key public 
services, such as schools and 
hospitals, local amenities, and 
work –with more people 
commuting by bus than all other 
forms of public transport 
combined
1
. Overall, there are three 
times as many trips in England 
made by local bus than made by 
rail, with over 60% of public 
transport trips made by bus
2
. 
Benefits of bus services
Health and environment
Bus use can improve air quality and deliver 
significant health benefits:
•Lower pollution: A diesel bus emits 10 times 
less NOx emissions per passenger per 
kilometre compared to a diesel car
7
. 
•Supporting active lifestyles: Buses 
encourage passengers to walk and cycle, 
especially for the first and last miles
8
. In 
research about the impact of concessionary 
fares on active life-styles, it was found that 
74% of the people studied participated in new 
activities or visited new places using public 
transport
9
. 
•Improving well-being through social 
interaction: Travelling by bus provides 
opportunities for meaningful social interaction 
and a sense of belonging and visibility in the 
public arena, with proven positive impact on 
well-being
10
. 
Economic
Buses are an essential enabler for economic 
activity:
•Business activity: Buses generate an 
estimated £64bn in economic output each year. 
Buses are also the primary mode of access to 
city centres, facilitating an estimated 29% of city 
expenditure
3
. 
•Productivity: In the UK, around 400,000 people 
are estimated to be in more productive jobs as a 
direct result of access to bus services
3
. Based 
on average occupancy, a single bus moves 10 
times as many people as a car
3
, and a 10% 
reduction in congestion can result in increased 
economic productivity of 1%
4
. 
•Affordability: Buses provide a more affordable 
transport option, and are around 60% cheaper 
than commuting by car. Buses also primarily 
serve the lower income groups
5
.
•Flexibility:Buses are a flexible form of public 
transport, taking on average 56 days to set up a 
new route, compared to years for a new train 
line
6
.
Social
Buses support the young, the older and the 
disabled passengers:
•Accessible services: 98% of buses in 
England are accessible for wheelchair users, 
with amenities such as boarding lifts and 
ramps, wheelchair spaces and wheelchair 
restraints
11
.
•Serving those in need: There were 929 
million concessionary bus journeys in England 
in 2016/17, amounting to a total of 34% of all 
local bus journeys and £1.13bn of 
concessions
12
. 
•High satisfaction: Bus passengers are 
generally very satisfied with bus services (for 
example, with 88% overall journey satisfaction 
outside London
13
).

Bus Open Data
The move to 
digital services
10
Consumers are increasingly 
using digital services, 
enabled by open data, across 
a range of industries. 
Transport customers also 
want information and data 
driven services –this data 
can lead to higher revenues 
for operators and new 
commercial opportunities. 
Transport customers want
14,15,16
:
Integrated information 
on multi-modal journeys
A ‘single source of 
truth’, ideally using a 
single app or website
Real-time reliable 
information including 
disruption alerts
Information about prices 
and payment through a 
single platform
The progress on opening bus data
Open data already exists in the bus sector –data that is available to everyone to access, use and share. For 
example, Traveline publishes national bus data, including timetable and real-time information where available
6
. 
However, bus data availability is often insufficient or inconsistent. 9% of buses in England do not provide real time 
bus information
11
to passengers and there is no single source of bus data on arrival times, real-time location, fare 
prices and ticketing
6
. 57% of buses are not enabled for payment by contactless bank cards
11
. 
Overall, a lack of open data is important because of the context of the bus industry’s patronage challenge. In 
England, patronage has fallen by 4% since 2009/10
11
, with low satisfaction amongst some passengers because they 
do not have access to the information they need to plan their journey
15,16
. 
Most young passengers use a single source of information to plan their journey, with 46% using GoogleMaps and 
44% using travel websites
16
.

Case Study
RDG Darwin: 
Open data in the 
rail industry

11
The Rail Delivery Group’s ‘Darwin’ is the official 
open data hub for the British rail industry. Darwin 
provides information from operators to all interested 
parties, including National Rail Enquiries, app 
developers and external journey planning apps such 
as Trainline, fostering innovation:
•RDG opened operators’ data, including 
timetables, historic service performance and 
real-time information;
•Darwin provides better information to customers, 
increases customer satisfaction and reduces 
operators’ operational costs;
•Third-party developers provide additional 
services. For example, Blackbox provides real-
time information at stations, and app developers 
are currently building a platform to deliver real-
time disruption updates to customers.
•By opening up data at no cost to individual 
developers, the rail industry has seen an 
increase in innovation and lowering of costs for 
real-time information signage and displays.

Reading Buses is an early adopter of digital 
services. It sees data as a business asset for 
new commercial opportunities, and 
emphasises using technology to improve 
customer experience. 
It has a ‘data lab’ and continuously innovates. 
For example, it developed a tree-strike tool, 
allowing tree strikes on buses to be reported 
to the Local Authority. This innovation will 
soon be commercialised. 
It publishes fare data, real-time information, 
vehicle specifications and other types of data. 
Customer satisfaction is ranked among the 
highest in the country, at 93%, supporting 
increased demand for bus services in the 
Reading area.
“We can see that opening our data allows 
third parties to use and integrate our services 
with their own ideas, improving our reach and 
helping us to think differently too".

Bus Open Data
How publishing 
open data will 
work?
14
DfT wants to follow a distributed model for open data
3
DfTwill publish data 
standards for operators 
and build a ‘Discovery 
Portal’ (providing links 
to external websites 
and ‘application 
programming 
interfaces’ and 
providing an overview 
of available 
information). 
Operators will publish 
data independently, 
through their website or 
API, through a local 
authority ‘bureau 
service’ or using a third 
party technology 
provider.
Local authorities can 
continue to provide 
bureau services to 
publish bus 
information. Local 
authorities should 
continue to validate the 
operators’ data and 
provide training, 
support and tools to 
operators where 
appropriate.
Technology service 
providers can provide tools 
to operators and local 
authorities to publish their 
data, provide discovery 
portals with additional 
functionalities and use the 
data to provide value-
adding services to end-
users.

17
Open data allows other 
companies to use that data to 
deliver new services to 
passengers. This creates new 
revenue opportunities and 
enables innovation. For 
example, Citymapper, one of the 
first journey planning apps in 
London, was born through open 
data. It is now providing its own 
transport services, and opening 
up that data for other users
17
.
•What is it?: Citymapper, known for its journey 
planning app, launched an on-demand shared 
transport service called ‘Smart Ride’ that blurs the 
lines between buses and taxis
19
.
•How does it use open data?: Citymapper’s 
operations were enabled by TfL’s open data 
database
17
. Citymapper advocates open data and 
releases routes, stops and schedule in GTFS format 
to support the transport data ecosystem
20
.
Case study: Citymapper

•What is it?: The ArrivaClick app connects users to on-
demand vehicle services. The users can see the 
location of vehicles along the route and receive real-
time expected arrival time.
•How does it use a digital approach?: ArrivaClick 
services are enabled by an effective partnership with a 
technology supplier, Via, and use passengers’ location 
to calculate the most efficient route to match the 
demand for services with supply of vehicles in real-time.

Put the 
passenger first
The government wants to provide a step change in the 
information available to bus passengers in England so 
that passengers have easy access to information on 
timetables, routes, and fares as a minimum.
Be digital by

The data would then be open to anyone who needs it 
including app developers who can develop products for 
passengers. 
Collaboratively 
develop 
regulation
DfT wants to develop a system that works for everyone, 
underpinned by secondary legislation. The government 
intends to shape this together with operators, local 
authorities and wider stakeholders, with the 
requirements tobe phased in by 2020 in stages.
Local government role
Local authorities can enable digital 
adoption and open data. 
They have an important role in data 
validation, and can empower operators 
to provide accurate data. Many LAs 
provide training and support, back-
office services and tools to allow 
operators to provide better data. For 
example, Norfolk County Council 
provides free bus registration and a 
data management tool to operators, 
and gradually increased electronic 
registration to over 95% in the region. 
Local authorities can support the move 
to open data by publishing their own 
transport data, including additional data 
sources where available. 
The Government will help 
ensure consistency and pace in 
opening up bus data. The Bus 
Services Act, which came into 
force in April 2017, enables 
Government to set legislation 
which will require information 
from all bus operators on 
timetables, fares and routes.
