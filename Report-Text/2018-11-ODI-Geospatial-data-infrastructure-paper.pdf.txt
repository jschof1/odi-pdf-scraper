Executive summary 
Geospatial data is about places. It might be about a specific building, a river or other natural 
feature, or a broader location like a city or country. 
 
Maps are geospatial data that has been visualised. That same data can be used in many 
other ways. It can help us find efficient transport routes, plan homes and businesses or 
identify areas at risk of flooding. 
 
Geospatial data’s importance for different sectors makes it essential that the UK has both a 
strong open geospatial data infrastructure and the capacity to use it to its full potential. 
 
The Open Data Institute (ODI) is running a project to explore challenges that face the UK’s 
geospatial data infrastructure, and opportunities to support the publishing and use of openly 
licensed geospatial data.  
 
This report summarises the desk research carried out as part of that project. The full range of 
project outputs – including user research – can be found on the​ ​geospatial data and 
technology​ project page​. 
 
 
In this report we look at: 
 
●the different types of geospatial data and its economic value 
●some of the technical and policy trends that affect how geospatial data 
is collected, published and used in the UK and globally 
●the components of the UK’s geospatial data infrastructure, including 
some of the data assets, standards, and organisations stewarding that 
infrastructure. 
 
 
To highlight the range of organisations that contribute to, maintain and benefit from 
geospatial data, we also look at the data ecosystem supported by Ordnance Survey (Great 
Britain’s national mapping agency) and the community-curated and open source mapping 
project, OpenStreetMap. 
 
We do not assess the UK's capability in geospatial skills and delivery, or the legislative 
environment and bodies that govern the UK's geospatial data infrastructure. For example, in 
this paper we have not considered the powers of the Geospatial Commission. 
 
We conclude this report with ways to strengthen the parts of the geospatial data 
infrastructure that we have assessed. Specifically, we raise the importance of: 
 
●removing the friction caused by restrictive data licensing 
●linking and standardising data assets to improve quality 
●ensuring ethical and equitable access to geospatial data 
●innovating around the business models that will help to sustain an open geospatial 
data infrastructure 
●using open approaches to avoid a closed geospatial data ecosystem 
●recognising the role of OpenStreetMap as a link to a global geospatial data 
infrastructure.

What is geospatial data? 
Geospatial data describes locations.  
 
It can be about specific places – such as the address of a building or the path of a railway line 
– or larger geographic areas, such as a city, region or country. It can also be about 
landscape, such as elevation, geology, land cover, natural habitats and water resources. 
 
Maps are the most well-known, familiar example of how we use geospatial data. Maps are 
images of the real world that help us to navigate and understand our environment. They are 
visualisations made by combining different types of geospatial data.  
 
Figure 1 illustrates how a number of geospatial datasets describing terrain, land use, 
waterways, transport and boundaries might be combined to help us to visualise a geographic 
area or point.  
 
However, much of the value of geospatial data comes from using it as raw data that can be 
used to deliver insights into the state of our natural environment, implement policy and help 
us make decisions in our daily lives.  
 
Each of the datasets that make up the different layers in Figure 1 can provide useful 
information. For example, we can use the transport layer to build navigation tools and analyse 
transport times to help commuters move across a city.  
 
The most useful insights come from using two or more layers of geospatial data.  Combining 
multiple datasets helps us perform more complex analyses – it means we can explore 
different aspects of the built environment, such as access to health facilities, schools and 
public green spaces. We can also use geospatial data to analyse elements of the natural 
environment which can help us understand causes and impacts of climate change and 
flooding. 
 
Geospatial data also helps us build models of what is likely to happen in a given location over 
time. For example, Global Positioning System (GPS) data collected from mobile phones can 
help predict future commuting patterns and the physical infrastructure improvements needed 
to manage them. 
 
Geospatial data can enrich other types of data – data about the social, economic and cultural 
aspects of a population. As Baroness Andrews stated in her ​foreword to the 2008 UK location 
strategy​: “In almost everything, people need to know when and where things happen: place 
matters.”. Adding location as context – a practice known as georeferencing – makes it 
1
possible to analyse complex social and economic trends and how those trends impact 
different geographic areas of the country.

At the ODI we have previously written about the demand for data – including geospatial data 
– to inform policymaking as part of ​our research into the peer-to-peer accommodation sector 
and its impact on different geographic regions. We have also created tools that use 
2
geospatial analyses to help inform policymaking, such as ​the tools to assess the potential 
impact of planned fire station closures in London​. 
3
 
Geospatial data – whether it comes from commercial businesses, public sector organisations 
or crowdsourcing initiatives – is a vital part of our ​data infrastructure​. As we explain below, 
data infrastructure is made up of data assets, standards, technologies, policies and the 
organisations that steward and contribute to them.  
 
Geospatial data helps people, communities and organisations make decisions in almost all 
aspects of life and across all sectors of our economy. For instance, a recent global survey run 
by local intelligence company Carto found that 94% of large businesses ​collect and/or store 
location data​. 
4
 
A number of technologies and sectors are heavily reliant upon geospatial data from the public 
and private sector. Without sustainable access to geospatial data which is as open as 
possible, it will be harder for organisations to innovate, grow or operate within the UK with a 
corresponding impact on both the economy and the services received by citizens and 
consumers. 
 
Organisations in the logistics sector rely on geospatial data to get people, food and parcels 
from A to B efficiently and effectively. Autonomous and connected vehicles use geospatial 
data in services such as in-car navigation and driver assistance systems like lane departure 
warnings, parking proximity, and cruise control. Drones rely on geospatial data for 
geofencing, for example to stop them flying over airports. Transport services use geospatial 
data to improve routing recommendations, model traffic flows and manage highway 
resources. 
 
Geospatial data can either be closed, shared or open data. To help clarify what distinguishes 
these types of data, the ODI has designed ​The Data Spectrum​ with examples of each.  
5
 
Open data is data that anyone can access, use and share. For data to be considered ‘open’, 
it must be published in an accessible format, with a licence that permits anyone to access, 
use and share it. 
 
Like other parts of our data infrastructure, we believe that geospatial data should be as open 
as possible – with data being open for anyone to access, use and share – while respecting 
privacy, national security and commercial confidentiality.  
 
Geospatial data plays a fundamental role in our data infrastructure because it provides spatial 
context for other types of data. What use is a land ownership record unless we know where 
the land is? Or a list of supermarket services unless we know where to find them? When the 
availability and openness of geospatial data is restricted, this can limit the openness and 
utility of other data.

The economic value of 
geospatial data  
Recent studies have shown geospatial data’s economic value in stimulating innovation, 
encouraging economic growth and helping to improve the delivery of public services.  
6
 
Though there is a lack of consensus around the best research methods to use when 
attempting to ​quantify the economic and social value of data​, these studies consistently 
7
illustrate the value of geospatial data, at both a macroeconomic and microeconomic level.  
 
A 2017 study by AlphaBeta, for instance, concluded that ​each year geospatial data and 
services generate $400bn in global revenue​, save people $550bn worth of time and fuel when 
traveling, and drive $1.2bn of indirect sales worldwide. In the European Union (EU), ​the 
8
benefits of the INSPIRE Directive​ – which aims to create a European-wide geospatial data 
infrastructure – are estimated to be between €770m and €1.15bn per year (against costs of 
€93m to €138m). More recently, a ​2018 study by the UK ​Cabinet Office​ predicted that 
9
making parts of the Ordnance Survey’s OS MasterMap more openly available would boost 
the UK economy by at least £130m each year. 
10
 
At a microeconomic level, in 2017, Deloitte found that ​Transport for London generates 
economic benefits and savings of up to £130m each year​, by opening up access to 
geospatial data – such as the locations of rail lines, embarkation points and facilities, and 
georeferenced data – such as timetables, transit status, and updates about disruptions and 
scheduled works.  
11
 
The benefits, which included reduced travel time, not needing to produce in-house apps and 
campaigns, job creation and revenue from new services are set against a relatively small 
estimated cost of around £1m per year for publishing the data openly, suggesting a 
significant return on investment.  
 
In Denmark, a study commissioned by the Danish Enterprise and Construction Authority 
found that the direct financial benefit to society of opening Danish address data amounted to 
roughly DKK ​471m (€62m)​ between 2005 and 2009, set against  relatively small costs of DKK 
15m (€2m) across the same period. 
12
 
The UK government has estimated that ​maximising the value of location data 
could generate £6–11bn​ each year across five commercial sectors:

●Sales and marketing​​ (£1.1– 2.2 bn): Location data has the potential to 
reduce distribution costs, lower staff costs and reduce ineffective 
spending in use cases like location-based advertising and end-to-end 
supply chain management. 
 
●Property and land​​ (£1.5–2.5 bn): Because location is an integral part of 
property and land management, improved access to geospatial data 
has the potential to benefit the entire sphere, for example by improving 
price-realisation and reducing the cost of claims processing, due to 
more precise understanding of the risks associated with certain areas. 
 
●Infrastructure and construction​​ (£2.2–4.6 bn): Among other things, 
increased access to location data can improve network infrastructure 
planning by helping to create better and cheaper GIS-enabled tools, 
and can improve site identification by providing better understanding of 
the environmental risks associated with different regions. 
 
●Mobility​​ (£1.0–1.9 bn): Location data can enable route optimisation 
leading to decreased travel times, reduced fuel costs and increased 
driver productivity.  
 
●Natural resources​​ (£0.2–0.3 bn): Greater access to location data has 
the potential to improve the accuracy and productivity of autonomous 
farming, mining and monitoring equipment.

Global trends in geospatial 
data 
This section focuses on global indicators and trends that highlight how geospatial data 
infrastructure is evolving around the world. Exploring these general trends provides context 
relevant to our exploration of the UK’s geospatial data infrastructure later in the report.  
 
One of the most important trends being felt by governments and public sector geospatial 
data stewards (those who collect, maintain and share data) is the increasingly large role 
played by commercial and community organisations in the same space – that is, also as 
collectors and aggregators of geospatial data. 
Comparing international geospatial data capability and readiness 
Several studies and research projects have set out to catalogue, assess and rank the 
readiness and capability of countries in publishing nationally important location data. The 
studies stress different metrics and criteria, and have a common aim of identifying areas in 
need of improvement.  
14
 
One such study, conducted by the Global Spatial Data Infrastructure Association, suggests 
that assessing countries against a range of criteria will ‘allow investment and decision making 
to be directed towards problematic areas’ and will ultimately help nations develop the 
infrastructure necessary to ensure that geospatial data is ‘accurate, transparent, open and 
interoperable’.  
15
 
It is important to note that different national mapping agencies have different public tasks or 
remits, and have therefore set themselves different missions and objectives. Even so, a few 
16
national frontrunners and cross-national themes have emerged in these studies.  
 
Countries within the EU generally fare well in assessments of geospatial capability and 
readiness. One study published by Geospatial Media and Communications included 15 
European countries in its top 25, due in large part to the role played by the ​INSPIRE 
17
Directive​ in helping to define policies and standards for geospatial data.  
18
 
The directive lays out four steps that member states are required to take in cultivating and 
managing geospatial datasets: 1) identify spatial datasets; 2) document these datasets 
(metadata); 3) provide services for identified spatial datasets (discovery, view, download); and 
4) make spatial datasets interoperable by aligning them with the common data models. 
19
According to a 2018 summary of ​progress made by the directive over the previous decade,

there had been adequate progress on steps one and two, but less progress on steps three 
and four.  
 
Interestingly, while INSPIRE focuses on data access rather than open licensing, the same 
2018 report found that in those member states where open data was a political priority, open 
data policy initiatives and INSPIRE directives had been implemented in a complementary 
manner, leading to greater use of location data within those countries, and the development 
of stronger, more mature, national geospatial data infrastructures. 
 
 On the other hand, in those countries where open data has been less of a priority, 
21
implementation of INSPIRE directives has been generally driven by legal obligation, leading to 
geospatial infrastructures that are comparatively underdeveloped, underutilised, and less 
open. 
 
The United States (US) also tends to rank highly in readiness assessments, with the Global 
Geospatial Industry Outlook report ranking it first overall in its geospatial capability and 
readiness. The ​Federal Geographic Data Committee​ works to promote the development, 
22
sharing, use, and publication of geospatial data within the US, regularly publishing ​‘strategic 
plans’ to develop the country’s national geospatial data infrastructure​. 
 
The same Global Geospatial Industry Outlook report ranked the UK second in its geospatial 
capability and readiness, but seventh in its national infrastructure and policy framework, 
showing there is still room for improvement.  
23
 
The report also highlights that open data initiatives can help facilitate geospatial development 
programmes and ensure that organisations can gain value from geospatial data, whether 
through improved efficiency, economic growth or benefits for society as a whole. As 
mentioned above, one reason that many EU countries, including the UK, rank highly is that 
they follow shared guidelines, like INSPIRE, and take part in collaborative ventures, like 
Copernicus, the European Space Agency’s (ESA’s) Earth observation programme. It is as yet 
unclear what impact the UK leaving the EU would have on the UK’s commitment to 
guidelines such as these, and the benefits it receives from such collaborations. 
 
A number of lower- and middle-income countries are also taking steps to improve their 
readiness and capability. For example, the ​Africa Regional Data Cube​ is providing access to 
satellite and Earth observation data for Kenya, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Ghana and Tanzania. 
Through its ​One Map Initiative​, Indonesia has been working to create and maintain its 
geospatial data infrastructure, seeing it as a means of tackling deforestation and land-use 
challenges by increasing the accuracy, transparency, interoperability, and openness of 
geospatial data.  
24
 
A recent survey by Geospatial Media Communications of the policy frameworks of many 
lower and middle-income countries found that although policies have been put in place to 
promote access and use of location data, actual progress has been slow when compared to 
many high-income countries. This is attributed to the fact that the policies are often not 
legally binding and lack clear timetables, procedures or delegated responsibilities. 
25
 
Recommendations in a WWF 2016 survey of the status and importance of national spatial 
data infrastructure urged the UK government to support the development of spatial data 
infrastructure in other countries through: direct investment; promoting open data principles; 
establishing global standards; drafting laws and policies related to open data and spatial data 
transparency; and, ultimately, through leading by example.

Trends in open geospatial data 
Just as not all countries are developing their national geospatial data infrastructure in the 
same manner, not all governments are providing access to geospatial resources in the same 
way.  
 
In recent years, the Australian government has taken steps to open up a range of geospatial 
datasets and resources. Following the ‘​Declaration of Open Government​’ in 2010, the ​Digital 
27
Transformation Agency​ (DTA) created ​data.gov.au​ as a means of finding, accessing and 
reusing public government datasets, including geospatial datasets. At the time of writing, 
there are over ​5,500 datasets​ from GeoScience Australia alone.  
 
In 2014, the DTA launched ​National Map​, an online service that allows users to search 
through a catalogue of geospatial datasets made openly available by public agencies and 
overlay them on a 3D map of Australia. The following year the Australian government released 
a ‘​Public Data Policy Statement​’ reaffirming and formalising its commitment to making 
‘non-sensitive data open by default’ with the aim of contributing to ‘greater innovation and 
productivity improvements across all sectors of the Australian economy’. More recently, the 
28
government has released ​PSMA​’s ​Geo-coded National Address File (G-NAF)​ along with their 
Administrative Boundaries datasets.  
29
 
The EU has also been moving towards opening up geospatial data and showing its 
commitment to open data in general. In 2003, the European Commission set up a ​legal 
framework​ enabling the re-use of public sector information and in 2015 launched the 
European Data Portal​, a repository of freely accessible public sector data. In 2011, the EU 
30
published a communication​ that pledged to open up data as ‘an engine for innovation, 
growth and transparent governance' and pointed to geospatial data as an explicit example of 
the value of open data.  
31
 
In 2014, the ESA announced that it would provide ‘free, full and ​open access’ to data from 
the Copernicus programme​, including data collected by the new ​Sentinel series​ of satellites. 
32
The ESA has since launched the ‘​Copernicus Open Access Hub​’, an online platform that 
provides open data for all current Sentinel missions through both an interactive graphical 
user-interface and an application programming interface (API).  
 
Anne Hale Miglarese, Founder and CEO of Radiant Earth, which advocates for  
open geospatial data for positive impact ​noted the ESA’s commitment to open data​ and 
specifically its Earth Observation Handbook, which estimates that Earth observation data 
plays a role in most of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and around a quarter of all 
the SDG targets. She writes: “Without this high-quality and accessible data, we would 
struggle in many cases to quantify the majority of [SDGs]”. 
 
In ​Open Knowledge International’s 2016/17 Open Data Index​, Great Britain was ranked third, 
behind Taiwan and Australia overall, yet was ranked significantly lower in terms of open 
address data (13th) and open land tenure data (10th). Beyond a few top-performing 
33
countries, openness in these two important areas is generally poor, showing that there is 
much room for improvement – not only within Great Britain but globally. Similarly, though the 
UK is ranked second overall in the World Wide Web Foundation’s latest ​Open Data

Barometer​ behind Canada, it is ranked low on Map Data and Land Data – once again 
showing room for improvement in these important geospatial areas. 
34
 
In the US, much of the recent commitment to making geospatial datasets openly available 
appears to stem from the Obama Administration’s 2009 ​Open Data Policy​, which defined 
data as a ‘valuable national resource and strategic asset’ that should be made ‘available, 
discoverable, and usable – in a word, open’.  
35
 
To that end, the Federal Geographic Data Committee coordinates and oversees, 
GeoPlatform​, an online portal that provides open access to geospatial data and openly 
available applications and services. A similar service is provided by ​The US Geological 
Survey​ (USGS) through its service, ​NationalMap​.  
 
A well-known example of the US’s commitment to open geospatial data is the ​archive of US 
Landsat imagery​, which was made openly and freely available in 2009. A ​2013 study by the 
US Geological Survey​ estimated that the global economic benefit of opening up access to 
this near 50-year archive of imagery of the Earth’s surface was $2.19bn in 2011 alone. The 
36
archive of imagery was used across the world in areas like environmental science, agriculture 
and education and created value by improving long-term environmental planning and 
monitoring, enabling better enforcement of regulations and improving decision making. 
37
Commercial and community stewards are becoming more important 
This section focuses on some specific advances in geospatial technologies and the products 
and services built upon them. It then explains where commercial organisations are performing 
roles once played by national mapping agencies and suggests the positive and negative 
impacts this may have. 
 
From satellites and light detection and ranging (LiDAR) systems, to the internet of things (IoT) 
and handheld, GPS-enabled devices, recent technological advancements have reduced the 
cost of production for many types of geospatial data. Alongside these advancements, new 
techniques like machine learning and computer vision have made it easier to extract greater 
value and insights from those datasets.  
 
These technological advances have made it possible for commercial organisations to collect 
geospatial data at a scale previously reserved for national mapping agencies and to analyse 
those datasets in novel ways. This has meant they can create innovative geospatial products 
and services, which in many cases, rival those offered by national mapping agencies and 
public sector bodies.  
 
National mapping agencies and other public bodies therefore find themselves confronted by 
an important question: how to respond to the increasingly large role played by ​commercial 
organisations as collectors, aggregators and stewards of geospatial data​. 
38
Advances in data collection 
The recent proliferation of low-cost satellites has made it possible for commercial 
organisations to amass fleets of imaging and remote-sensing satellites that rival those of 
national mapping agencies and military organisations. For example, ​DigitalGlobe​, a subsidiary 
of ​Maxar Technologies​, uses satellite-mounted cameras to provide customers with 
high-resolution imagery. Planet, an American satellite company based in San Francisco, uses 
its collection of nearly ​200 cubesats to image Earth’s entire landmass, every day​.

This ‘partial democratisation of space’, as the ​Financial Review has described it​, has made it 
possible for a range of organisations to access and use Earth imagery that would have 
previously been unavailable to them. Investors can tally the number of oil storage tanks in a 
40
particular country to estimate consumption patterns, and farmers can estimate global crop 
yields. The imagery can also be used to help human rights groups expose atrocities in 
inaccessible or extremely dangerous places, such as in Syria and Myanmar, or 
environmentalists to track deforestation in remote wildernesses. Governments routinely 
41
access commercial satellite imagery in planning disaster response and border monitoring.  
 
However, the astronomical rise in the number of commercial satellites – and the vast imagery 
datasets stewarded by their parent companies – raises a number of questions, particularly 
with regards to privacy.  
 
There is currently a lack of regulation of this space, and although the resolution of commercial 
satellites is often not high enough to pinpoint individuals – the majority of Planet’s 200 
cubesats have a ​pixel resolution of three metres​ – future advances in satellite technologies 
may make it possible. 
 
Closer to the ground, advances in light detection and ranging ​(LiDAR) systems​ could make it 
easier to render 3D maps of urban and rural environments. LiDAR sensors can be used to 
42
create extremely detailed 3D maps of terrain, environmental features and buildings. The 
Environment Agency, for instance, recently announced plans to conduct a LiDAR survey of 
the entirety of England at a resolution of 1m by mid-2020. It noted that advances in LiDAR 
43
will enable its aircraft to fly at a higher altitude, covering more ground with each flight. 
Advances have made LiDAR more affordable, as well as effective. For instance, car-mounted 
LiDAR systems used to cost upwards of US $75,000, but researchers expect the price to 
drop below $1,000, and possibly even below $100. 
44
 
Though national mapping agencies are ​conducting LiDAR surveys of their own, and are in 
45
some cases ​making that data openly available, there is often a gap between the detail 
46
offered by these national sources and the detail required by many industries and sectors. For 
example, to support the development of autonomous vehicles, a number of commercial 
organisations – including Google, Uber, Ford and General Motors – are competing to fill this 
gap by ​developing the detailed, expansive and real-time maps​ that self-driving cars will rely 
upon. 
47
 
The commercial drive to develop 3D maps causes some unintended consequences, in 
particular that having so many commercial firms racing to create 3D maps will lead to a 
fragmentation of the market. Good public sector alternatives or industry-wide standards and 
data sharing will be needed to avoid a great deal of duplicated effort.

Advances in analysis and extraction 
As well as making it easier for commercial organisations to collect vast amounts of geospatial 
data, technological advancements are making it easier for them to extract greater value and 
insights from those datasets. 
 
Emerging technologies such as machine learning and computer vision can identify and 
extract details such as road signs, street names and populated areas from images or videos. 
For instance, ​Skynet​ (the machine learning platform of ​Development Seed​) uses machine 
learning to gain insights from satellite and drone imagery. Similarly, artificial intelligence (AI) 
company ​Tanka​ uses satellite imagery and a suite of AI techniques to detect fires and 
automate response procedures.  
 
When applied to satellite or drone imagery, companies can use these sorts of techniques to 
automatically inspect critical infrastructure, such as roads or ​electrical lines​, identify and 
49
track objects such as ships or ​aeroplanes​, ​evaluate crop performance or ​monitor 
505152
deforestation​.  
53
 
Many of the organisations leading in this area are from the private sector at present. In some 
cases, the commercial firms developing these techniques are working with public sector 
organisations to tackle pressing issues. For instance, using computer vision techniques the 
Facebook Connectivity Lab​ and the ​Center for International Earth Science Information 
Network​ have produced detailed maps of the distribution of buildings and populations in rural 
regions of 18 countries. ​The maps – which the World Bank described as ‘unprecedentedly 
54
high-resolution’– were generated at-scale, and can help governments and 
55
non-governmental organisations (NGOs) develop a relatively complete picture of population 
distribution, when combined with information gathered from traditional government surveys 
and censuses. 
 
When applied to ground-level imagery, machine learning, computer vision and deep-learning 
techniques can help organisations to identify important geographic information. ​Google’s 
Street View​ and ​Mapillary​, for instance, use deep-learning to extract valuable information – 
such as street and business names, addresses and front-entrances of buildings – from their 
databases of street imagery.  
56
 
This data can be crucial for delivery companies: knowing the exact location of a business or 
residential entrance can save time and money. Of course, alongside these time- and 
cost-saving benefits, commercial organisations can also promote innovation and create 
economic and societal benefits.  
 
These techniques are as relevant for the non-commercial sector using geospatial data to 
develop public interest solutions for wider societal and economic benefits. It is important that 
researchers in this sector, who are exploring issues that may be overlooked by commercial 
concerns, are supported in their research and have access to similarly high-quality, relevant 
geospatial datasets.

Commercial stewards hold valuable data about people and their movements 
Thanks to the proliferation of GPS-enabled smartphones and devices, it is possible to 
capture information about where people go, how long it takes them to get there and  how 
long they stay.  
 
Companies such as ​Strava​, a social network for athletes, ​Garmin​, a GPS-technology 
company, and ​Uber​, a ridesharing and transportation company, are able to use location data 
to generate detailed maps from people’s movements. Google is able to collect ​similar 
57
telemetry data​ through Google Maps. 
58
 
Alongside this, companies are working to improve the accuracy of GPS systems in 
smartphones. Uber, for instance, ​has developed software improvements​ to GPS for Android 
which aim to improve GPS accuracy in urban environments – particularly urban environments 
with tall buildings. Additionally, the semiconductor company ​Broadcom​ is working to 
59
produce mass-market GPS chips that will be capable of pinpointing a device’s location to 
within 30 centimetres – a significant improvement, considering current systems are typically 
only accurate within three to five metres. 
60
 
Having collected huge quantities of location data, many commercial organisations now 
steward datasets of people’s movements that rival, or indeed surpass, those stewarded by 
public sector organisations in both breadth and depth. This raises questions related to 
whether these nascent data stewards will silo their voluminous datasets or choose to make 
aggregated and anonymised data derived from them – and the valuable insights that could be 
gleaned from that data – more openly available to organisations, and communities. 
 
Among the most important datasets stewarded by commercial organisations are those 
related to transportation and physical infrastructure. City planners and transport authorities, 
for instance, have said they could gain valuable insights from the ​data collected by private 
sector organisations​ about how people move through and interact with infrastructure like 
roads, tunnels, transport networks, walkways and public spaces.  
61
 
This is particularly important given the rise of new mobility services, as discussed in the ODI’s 
recent report, ‘​Personal data in transport​’. When ridesharing services like Uber and Lyft first 
62
started appearing in cities around 2010, cities struggled to compel these services to provide 
them with access to the operations data they held. Having learned from that experience, city 
and local governments have begun to press new ridesharing services such as scooter 
companies for data access from the outset. 
63
 
City planners want to know how new mobility services are affecting commuting patterns 
within their cities. For instance, if a transportation authority is deciding whether to convert a 
row of parking meters into a drop-off point for ride-hailing services, being able to combine the 
data they steward with data from private mobility companies would help make a more 
informed decision.  
64
 
In 2013, Strava released ​Global Heatmap​, a collection of data visualisations that highlight 
popular routes and locations within a given region. The visualisations were not detailed

enough to meet the needs of many public sector users, however, so Strava began to receive 
regular requests from city planners for access to the large datasets underpinning them. In 
response, ​Strava Metro​ was launched – a toolkit available to city planning departments 
offering a detailed view of pedestrian and cycling journeys across urban and rural areas. City 
planners and transportation departments have subscription-style access to data about 
routes, wait-times at intersections, periods of peak travel and the start  and end points of 
journeys within various regions.  
65
 
Uber has responded to repeated requests from public sector organisations and civil society 
for access to the data it has collected by launching ​Uber Movement​, an online platform 
enabling analyses of aggregated journey patterns. The ​London version of the platform was 
launched in March 2018​ and can help transportation authorities plan future infrastructure and 
assess the impact of past improvements. Whereas Strava Metro is available through 
66
subscription-style licensing, Uber Movement is freely accessible for anyone with an active 
Uber account. The granularity provided by Movement is much lower than that provided by 
Metro and other services however – a ​limitation that has been criticised​ by some. 
67
 
Google offers a similar service through ​WAZE​, the community-based traffic and navigation 
app that the company purchased in 2013. The ​Connected Citizens Programme​, launched in 
2014, connects international government departments in an effort to trade knowledge and 
find solutions to shared problems. Joining the programme is free but, unlike Strava Metro or 
Uber Movement, the initiative relies on a mutual exchange of data – would-be partners must 
commit to share data with WAZE in order to gain access.  
68
 
Google also runs a crowdsourcing initiative aimed at making its ​maps more useful for people 
with limited mobility​. Data sourced from its worldwide community of 30 million ‘​local guide​’ 
69
volunteers denotes the accessibility of buildings. While the data would prove valuable to city 
planners, it is still kept within Google rather than published openly. 
 
Even with these attempts to increase access to movement data, the fact that commercial 
organisations are stewarding so much data about people raises concerns about privacy. As 
we highlighted in our ​‘Personal data in transport’​ report, journey data is personal data. The 
70
journeys people take can be used to infer where they live, where they work, where they shop 
– even where their children go to school. A recent study published in ​Scientific Reports​, for 
instance, demonstrated that it is possible to ​identify 95% of people in a dataset using only 
four spatio-temporal data points​. Data from GPS-enabled fitness devices can even be used 
71
to ​reveal potential national security secrets​. 
72
Commercial stewards control some of the most accurate and widely used 
maps 
Though national mapping agencies across the world produce maps for public consumption 
and services like land registration, people are overwhelmingly turning to commercial maps for 
daily use. Considering the strong network effects driving their use, the dominance of 
commercial maps is likely to continue.

Google is a useful case in point. Since Google Maps launched in 2005, it has become ​the 
most popular and widely-used digital mapping service​, with over one billion users worldwide.
 Even Apple, which in 2012 launched its own map service, has not been able to unseat 
73
Google. Originally launched with data provided by a commercial provider, Google later 
switched to using its own geospatial data. By collecting an ambitious amount of satellite 
74
imagery, Google is able to give birds-eye views of every region on Earth.  
 
Using a ​fleet of cars loaded with digital cameras and GPS positioning devices​, Google was 
able to improve the outlines of its maps, collect important data such as street signs and 
business names, and provide users with street-level views of their route and destination. 
75
More recently, Google used advanced automated image recognition systems (along with 
satellite imagery from other commercial organisations) to create some of the most ​detailed 
maps of the outlines of buildings and structures​ in existence. New ​app features​ continue to 
76
be released, and in addition to these, Google offers a number of developer products and 
77
services such as ​location APIs​.  
 
Given Google’s dominance in this area – and the dominance of commercial mapping 
organisations in general – national mapping agencies are involved in a small proportion of 
consumer interactions. This is not necessarily a bad thing, but it does raise important issues 
for governments and national mapping agencies to address.  
 
 
The dominance of commercial mapping organisations: issues for government 
and mapping agencies 
 
1.First, given that commercial organisations are largely in control of what 
information is included in maps, they are also therefore in control of what users 
get to see and the options or recommendations users are shown. This can be 
important for things like the names of towns and places. A team of volunteers 
recently used OpenStreetMap to put together ​a map of Wales with place names 
in Welsh​, for instance, in an effort to address the fact that commercial map 
providers rarely offer or recognise such names in their proprietary offerings.  
78
 
2.Second, commercial dominance in mapping means that businesses will 
increasingly come to control the most up-to-date and expansive geospatial data, 
and therefore play a large role in stewarding critical data infrastructure, which 
people rely on in their day-to-day lives. For example, unprofitable parts of the 
market, or country, could be left underserved. As well as tackling the challenge 
of digital exclusion we may find ourselves needing to focus on data exclusion, as 
some parts of the country – eg more rural areas – unable to benefit from the 
services and insights received by the people who live in cities. Another risk 
79
here is if businesses choose to change their services, the critical data 
infrastructure in cities could rapidly disappear with knock-on effects to people, 
businesses and public services.

3.Third, if the profitability of maps is the main driver of their success and 
prevalence, important, but less profitable, products or services aimed at users 
with vision or hearing impairments, for example, may not survive. Similarly, users 
in rural regions may not be able to access maps of the same quality or detail as 
people in cities. 
 
4.Fourth, there are known issues to be addressed around commercial mapping 
organisations and privacy. A recent ​AP News investigation​ showed that even 
with ‘location history’ disabled, Google continues to track the location of its 
users. There are ways to disable this tracking, but they are ​neither transparent 
80
or straightforward​. For other services within Google Maps, such as labels or 
81
calendar connections, users ​must agree to activity tracking​ – those that do not 
are unable to use the service. 
 
5.Finally, companies may begin to monopolise entire services and have 
disproportionate control over consumers and markets. For instance, in June 
2018, Google significantly raised the prices for its Google Maps APIs – by 
1,400% according to ​some estimates​ – and altered its licensing terms so 
developers would no longer be able to use the APIs until they created an 
account and submitted credit card details. Developers would therefore need to 
82
have a choice of alternative services to avoid being locked in to specific 
platforms. 
 
This trajectory creates challenges for national mapping agencies.  
 
In the final section of this report, we put forward recommendations for how to meet these 
challenges and how to strengthen our national geospatial data infrastructure to maximise 
social and economic benefits.

A review of UK geospatial 
data policy 
This section focuses on recent milestones in the development of policy around geospatial 
data in the UK, trends towards increasing its access and openness, and impacts on 
geospatial data infrastructure in the UK. 
Increasing access and openness of geospatial data 
The ownership and management of the UK’s national geospatial data has been consistently 
fragmented, and campaigns for it to be collected by publicly-owned bodies and made be 
available to the UK taxpayer have been a feature of public debate for over a decade.  
 
The 2008 ​Location Strategy was one of the first UK-wide frameworks for managing and 
83
sharing geographic information in a consistent way to inform policy making. It incorporated 
the aims of the ​EU INSPIRE Directive and recommended coordination across central, local 
84
and devolved government with implementation led by the Department for Environment, Food 
and Rural Affairs (Defra) through the UK Location Programme. The achievements of the UK 
Location Programme included creating the ​UK Location Infrastructure – a single place to 
85
find and access UK location information.  
 
The perceived monopoly on geographic information held by ​Ordnance Survey and 
86
availability of transport information on ​Travel Direct were two examples routinely used by 
87
campaigners to argue for greater access to public data.  
 
The ​data.gov.uk​ portal was developed and launched in 2010 to help people find and access 
UK public sector open data and included links to the first publication of Ordnance Survey 
open data. 
 
In 2011, geospatial data’s prominence grew internationally, with the creation of the UN 
Committee of Experts on Global Geospatial Information Management. In 2013, the G8’s ​Open 
Data Charter identified data that would be most valuable if released, including strategic 
88
location data such as topography, postcodes, national and local maps, environment, social 
mobility and transport. This influenced the UK government’s open data policy and sparked a 
number of initiatives to open up public geospatial data in the UK.  
 
The UK Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) set up a transparency 
panel to oversee the delivery of its ​Open Data Strategy​. During the severe flooding of 
89
2013–14, the UK’s ​Environment Agency was asked to temporarily open up data that would 
90
help to identify areas of land that were liable to flooding. The goal was to enable and

encourage developers to find ways to use the data ​to support communities in protecting 
91
themselves from flooding​.  
 
Later in 2014, the National Flood Risk Assessment was made available as open data by the 
Environment Agency. This had previously been chargeable under a commercial licence. To 
make this data open, the Environment Agency had to negotiate with data suppliers, such as 
the Centre of Ecology and Hydrology and Ordnance Survey who provided data under 
licences that were not yet open.  
 
The release of this data was initially funded by the Cabinet Office, compensating the 
Environment Agency for lost revenue. Ordnance Survey had also received compensation from 
the Cabinet Office for the release of its open datasets.  
 
Supporting the release of open data in this way removes some immediate financial barriers 
but doesn’t address longer term issues such as ensuring sustainable access to data.  
 
In June 2015, the Secretary of State for the Environment challenged ​Defra group to release 
92
at least 8,000 datasets within one year. The organisations involved made over 10,000 
datasets available under an open licence, including key geospatial data assets such as 
high-resolution aerial images from LiDAR surveys, agricultural land classifications and marine 
and freshwater biological surveys.  
 
While this was a huge step forwards in the provision of open data, it is worth recognising that 
Defra group focused on the data that was relatively easy to publish openly. This included 
dataset that didn’t contain sensitive information or had no complex legal issues or third party 
intellectual property issues to resolve. Some of the data requested by users is still closed 
because it is harder to publish for technical, political, legal or security reasons such as field 
boundary data that is held by the Rural Payments Agency. 
Inconsistency in implementation 
While central government’s commitment is reflected in Defra’s Open Data Strategy and the 
UK Location programme, without firm targets and continued political will, progress has 
depended on individual minister’s appetite for a more open approach. A common issue is 
balancing the need of some government organisations – such as the UK Hydrographic Office 
and Ordnance Survey – to generate revenue as part of their funding model, with the desire to 
make more data available at no charge under an open licence.  
 
For example, the British Geological Survey’s data portal provides basic maps that can be 
downloaded for free under the Open Government Licence, but more detailed information is 
chargeable and has restrictions on use. 
 
Contradictory government decisions have limited availability of some key geospatial assets, 
which has in turn limited the social and economic value they generate.  
 
Address data is a case in point. In 2010, the government announced that ​postcode data 
93
would be available for free, but then included the ​Postcode Address File (PAF) – a key part 
94
of the UK’s geospatial data infrastructure – in the 2013 privatisation of the Royal Mail. ​A 2012 
report from the PAF Advisory Board estimated its value to the UK economy to be between 
£992m–1.32bn each year.  
95
 
The decision to sell this key part of national data infrastructure has meant that innovators 
wanting to use this address data in their products or services face considerable legal and

financial challenges. Initiatives like Open Addresses attempted to provide an alternative 
source of geospatial information to encourage innovation but demonstrated that this was not 
possible without significant investment or government action. 
96
Current policy 
Overall UK data policy is led by the Department for Media, Culture and Sport (DCMS). DCMS 
set out the future direction of data policy in the ​2017 UK Digital Strategy  and is working on 
97
the UK's first national data strategy.  
 
Geospatial data policy is controlled and led by the Geospatial Commission in the Cabinet 
Office. 
 
Historically, geospatial policy has been fragmented across organisations stewarding key data 
assets, and implementation of the strategy has been reliant on collaboration.  
 
The creation of the Geospatial Commission in 2017 has brought the opportunity for change 
and collaboration will still need to play an important role.  
98
 
HM Treasury announced the creation of the commission​ to maximise value from the UK’s 
location data. Part of its role is to provide strategic oversight and coordination to the work of 
six partner bodies known as the ‘Geo6’, including Ordnance Survey, HM Land Registry, UK 
Hydrographic Office, British Geological Survey, Coal Authority, Valuation Office Agency. Their 
collective aim is to make more national geospatial data available.  
 
While the ​Public Data Group bought together some major data bodies in 2011, this is the 
99
first time that key public bodies which steward geospatial data have been brought together to 
focus specifically on access to geospatial data. Of note is the varied geographical scope of 
the Geo6 and the omission of some parts of government that hold key data assets, such as 
Defra, the Environment Agency, Ordnance Survey Northern Ireland) and the devolved 
administrations.  
 
The early commitments from the Geospatial Commission are focused on opening up OS 
MasterMap. The commission is also funding four projects to improve discoverability, 
licensing, quality and linking of geospatial data assets. 
100
 
Over the next 12 months, the commission has said that it will work with GeoPlace, the Local 
Government Association, the Improvement Service (on behalf of Scottish Local Government), 
and Ordnance Survey to investigate opening up key aspects of address data to help join up 
data across the web. These specific aspects include the unique way in which properties and 
streets are identified and labelled.  
 
This central governance and coordination from the Geospatial Commission creates 
opportunities to strengthen the UK’s national geospatial data infrastructure. For example, by 
opening up more data or by increasing consistency in how data is published and licensed. 
 
The ​National Geospatial Strategy – due to be published at the end of 2019 – will set out the 
101
next steps. This strategy will need to take into account some of the global trends impacting

how geospatial data is collected, managed and used, and explore how more geospatial data 
can be opened. The Geospatial Commission will publish its annual plan in spring 2019. 
The impact of the UK leaving the EU 
The final terms under which the UK will leave the EU that are agreed by the UK and EU – or 
the ‘Brexit’ deal – may influence the ways in which the UK accesses, uses and shares 
geospatial data.  
 
Many of the laws that govern how the environment is managed and the ways that geographic 
information is shared stem from European Directives. Depending on the terms of the final 
deal, after 29 March 2019 the UK may lose its power to make legislation in the EU. However, 
it may not lose its soft power or ability to affect data policy and standards across Europe and 
globally. 
102
 
As part of actions to withdraw from the EU, the UK will need to debate the data-related 
legislation that is affected by its previous membership of the EU. The UK may choose to keep 
some; it may want to revise others. The extent to which the UK continues to comply with the 
INSPIRE Directive – which describes the way to document, discover and standardise 
geospatial data – will be part of this. Regardless of EU membership, the standards set out in 
the directive are useful for data exchange across geographical boundaries. In fact, several 
non-EU member states – such as Switzerland and Norway – have chosen to enact a number 
of INSPIRE requirements, despite not formally being part of the EU.  
 
A known risk is the impact of potential new ​EU copyright laws to community projects. The 
103
proposed laws, due for a final vote in January 2019, may require automated review of all 
uploads to check for copyright infringement. This creates challenges for community-run 
projects such as OpenStreetMap, as liability will fall to the platform as well as the user who 
generates the content.  
 
After the UK exits the EU, UK businesses, society and government will have a continuing 
need to access, use and share geospatial data that spans political and geographical borders. 
Important geographic datasets and reference data come from the EU and restricted access 
to this information may impact use and availability of products created from it. Information 
collected by satellites is an example of this. The European Space Agency’s ​Galileo satellite 
provides accurate global positioning and timing, and is used to support navigation, 
emergency response and other services in the UK.  
 
If agreement cannot be reached to retain access to key geospatial datasets, then government 
and groups in the wider geospatial community will need to decide how to fill that gap, so that 
the UK retains a strong geospatial data infrastructure.

Understanding the UK’s 
geospatial data 
infrastructure 
In December 2017, the UK National Infrastructure Commission ​recognised data as part of the 
UK’s key infrastructure​. The ODI believes that data is as important as our road, railway and 
105
energy networks, and should be treated as such. A trustworthy data infrastructure is one that 
is sustainably funded and is directed to maximise data use and value, to meet society’s 
needs.  
 
 
The ODI defines ​data infrastructure as consisting of: 
106
 
●data ​assets​​ such as identifiers, registers and datasets 
●the ​standards and technologies​​ used to curate and provide access to 
those data assets 
●the ​guidance and policies​​ that inform the use and management of 
data assets and the data infrastructure itself 
●the ​organisations​​ that govern the data infrastructure 
●the ​communities​​ involved in contributing to or maintaining it, and 
those who are impacted by decisions that are made using it 
 
 
The following sections will focus on data assets, standards and the key types of organisation 
that govern the UK’s geospatial data infrastructure. 
 
Our review of data assets is not intended to be comprehensive. For example, we highlight a 
number of datasets relating to addresses, locations and satellite data but have not 
extensively reviewed data about underground data assets. Also, while we briefly highlight 
some key standards and technologies, we do not explore the technical infrastructure required 
to support data collection – such as geodetic frameworks, earth observation satellites, etc. 
 
Many of the challenges in collecting, using and sharing geospatial data are similar to those 
encountered with other types of data. There are often cultural barriers to sharing; processes 
that need to be updated or created; collaboration needed with user communities; and 
investments in technology necessary to enable efficient access and use.  
 
There are some potential risks related to the sharing of geospatial data. For example, privacy 
issues associated with georeferenced data or national security concerns related to publishing 
the location of critical infrastructure. 
 
That said, the principles for building a strong geospatial data infrastructure are the same as 
other forms of data.  
107
 
To help build a picture of geospatial data infrastructure, we will look at each of the different 
aspects in turn.

What are the key types of geospatial data asset? 
Our definition of data infrastructure highlights several different types of data asset. These 
different assets typically play different roles in data infrastructure. For example, reference 
data  – identifiers and registers – help to standardise how data is managed and linked across 
providers. They might also be collected and maintained in different ways or have different 
profiles of risk associated with their publication.  
 
This section gives some examples of geospatial identifiers, registers and datasets that make 
up the UK’s geospatial data infrastructure. 
Identifiers 
Identifiers are crucial to the process of sharing information. They are fundamentally important 
in being able to make connections between data, which puts them at the heart of how we 
create value from structured data. 
108
 
Geospatial identifiers provide unambiguous labels or reference numbers for the things 
described in a geospatial dataset, such as lamp-posts, roads, houses, or administrative 
areas.  
 
 
There are several different ways in which identifiers can be assigned to 
things and locations. For example, they might be: 
 
●assigned automatically​​, eg based on the geographic coordinates of 
the location. Examples include Google ​Plus Codes​ and ​What 3 Words 
addresses 
●assigned by a single data steward​​, who has sole responsibility for 
maintaining the list of identifiers, eg the Office for National Statistics 
defines its own geographic identifiers for the areas referenced in 
statistical publications 
●assigned by multiple stewards​​ working in a federated system. This is 
often coordinated by a central organisation. For example, Unique 
Property Reference Numbers (UPRNs) are assigned by local 
government and Ordnance Survey, but Geoplace coordinates how 
blocks of identifiers are allocated to individual stewards  
 
 
To be useful, identifiers need to be associated with some basic reference data that helps to 
describe the location or object being identified, such as its name, type, location, etc.  
 
A 2014 ODI and Thomson Reuters report highlighted the importance of open identifiers to 
109
make connections between datasets, in this case adding geospatial context. Open identifiers 
are free from licensing or IP restrictions that might restrict how the identifiers can be used, eg 
to publish derived data. The basic reference data associated with the identifiers would also 
be available under an open licence.  
 
The report also highlights the need for data stewards to be transparent about how they 
assign and manage identifiers, and for a basic set of services that support reuse of the 
identifiers – to help link together data assets from different organisations, for example.

At present, most of the identifiers used in the UK geospatial data infrastructure are not open.  
 
Neither of the two key identifiers – Unique Property Reference Numbers (URPNs) and 
111
Topographic Identifiers (TOIDs) – are open. Both have some IP and licensing restrictions 
112
which limit reuse. For example, TOIDs can only be republished by Ordnance Survey 
customers the identifiers and reference data are not currently published directly by 
113
Ordnance Survey, although they will be made open in the OS OpenMap Local, as part of

the Geospatial Commission’s work to open up OS MasterMap. Ordnance Survey has in 
115
recent years permitted customers and licensees of their products to publish datasets that 
include UPRNs. However, the licensing remains complex. Recently announced work may 
116117
lead to UPRNs becoming more open. 
118
 
The UK has many competing and overlapping identifiers for addresses, property and land, 
which adds complexity to data publication and reuse. For example, it is often not clear how 
119
identifiers are assigned, or how they relate to each other. Lack of reference data – on 
boundaries, for example – makes it hard to understand how they align with one another. 
 
The identifiers are also typically only published as part of larger datasets. For example, TOIDs 
and the basic reference data associated with them are only available as part of the OS 
MasterMap products. This limits their potential uses. 
Registers 
Registers are lists of reference data that help to improve the consistency and quality in how data 
is published and used. They help to build confidence and trust in data by clarifying where 
different data stewards are referring to the same things in the same way. 
 
Registers are typically maintained by a custodian who defines the scope and contents of the 
list. The work of maintaining a list is often collaborative, requiring input from multiple 
organisations. 
120
 
Lists of identifiers – along with basic information about the object the identifier describes – 
are one type of register. There are other collections that could be published as a register to 
provide a shared, controlled vocabulary, helping to improve comparison with other datasets – 
such as the ​Ordnance Survey real-world object catalogue, which defines a list of different 
121
types of spatial object included in their products. 
 
Examples of registers for geospatial data include: 
 
●The Land Registry’s official register of land titles, which will include the 
identifier and reference data for each title 
●The ​Foreign and Commonwealth Office’s country register​, which 
provides a list of countries recognised by the UK 
●Lists of locations, for example ​National Rail’s list of railway stations 
●The ​EPSG Geodetic Parameter Dataset​, which provides reference data 
about different coordinate reference systems 
 
 
Registers, like identifiers, are typically useful in a number of different contexts and can help to 
strengthen data infrastructure if they are made as open as possible, and published in 
machine-readable formats.

Geospatial datasets 
The core data assets of the UK’s geospatial data infrastructure are those underpinning our 
understanding of the natural and man-made landscape around us and how we interact with 
it. It includes data on land cover, height, geology, habitats, water resources, geographic and 
political boundaries, structures, addresses, utilities and transport networks. 
 
There are three main types of geospatial data: raster data, vector data and point clouds. The 
same data is often published in a number of different data formats, accompanied by 
standardised metadata that helps to make it findable and usable.  
 
The list below explains the three main types of geospatial data and some examples of 
important UK datasets within them: 
 
●Raster data – this includes data collected by remote sensing, satellite and aerial 
122
imagery, scanned maps and other digital images, etc. 
 
○Earth observation data ​​(Defra) – satellite data used for large-scale harvesting 
123
of environmental data that helps us to observe and understand changes and the 
global impacts of our actions. 
○1:25 000 Scale Colour Raster ​​– ​the digital version of Ordnance Survey Explorer 
paper map series. 
 
●Vector data​​ – this represents data in two or three dimensions as points, lines and 
polygons. Point data might include individual objects, such as post boxes or 
monuments; lines can describe road and river networks; and polygons can be used 
to describe property boundaries, conservation areas, or polling districts  
 
○OS Mastermap ​​(Ordnance Survey) – highly detailed geospatial data with 
accuracy down to 1 meter. OS MasterMap is made up of six data products 
(transport network, imagery, water network, greenspaces, highways and 
topography) 
○AddressBase​​ (Ordnance Survey) – points identifying addresses from Royal 
Mail’s Postal Address File and links them to a location. 
○National Polygons ​​(Land Registry) – boundaries of registered land in England 
and Wales 
 
●Point clouds​​ – this represents data as points in 3D space, it is collected using 3D 
scanners (such as LiDAR) that can be mounted on planes, drones and cars 
 
○LiDAR point cloud ​​(Environment Agency) – measurements of the height of the 
terrain and surface objects on the ground, such as trees and buildings 
○Bathymetric Survey​​ (UK Hydrographic Office) – survey data measuring the 
depth of UK coastal waters 
 
Raster and vector data are the most common formats used by data stewards for publishing 
geospatial data. As mentioned before, often the same data can be represented or converted 
into multiple formats. For example, vector data might also be published as raster imagery so 
that it can be used as a background display for online maps. 
 
Point cloud data, while still relatively niche, is becoming increasingly available due to the 
rapidly falling costs of LiDAR scanners. Just as the falling costs of GPS sensors has 
124
allowed data to be collected from phones, cameras and sensors, we can expect more point 
cloud data to be routinely available about our cities and natural environment.

Although vector and raster data are the most common means by which geospatial data is 
typically distributed, the majority of all datasets are georeferenced, ie they include some form 
of spatial component. This spatial information might be fairly high-level – such a country 
name – or may include more specific location information via a location identifier or 
geographic coordinates. Georeferenced data also includes observational data, from sensors, 
mobile and GPS devices, etc. 
 
Earlier in this report, we highlighted how commercial organisations are increasingly collecting 
all types of geospatial data, but this is particularly true for georeferenced data due to the 
ubiquity of GPS sensors in mobile devices.  
What standards support geospatial data? 
Standards for data are reusable agreements that make it easier for people and organisations 
to publish, access, share and use better-quality data.  
125
 
Standards support the collection, management, publication and use of geospatial data in a 
variety of ways. For example, standard data formats and APIs ensure that geospatial data 
126
can be accessed and used in various tools. Standards also describe the key metadata 
required to make data assets discoverable. 
 
The table below summarises some of key types of geospatial data standards.

The main international standards body in the geospatial sector is the Open Geospatial 
Consortium (OGC), which works closely with other standards bodies such as the International 
Organisation for Standardisation (ISO) and more than 500 commercial, governmental, 
nonprofit and research organisations worldwide. 
 
Some of the recent innovation around publishing and using geospatial data on the web has 
been driven by the adoption of key specifications and standards, that were developed 
through community-led standards processes. Examples of such standards include GeoJSON 
and the Mapbox Vector Tiles specification, which make it easier for data users to create, build 
and deliver custom map-based visualisations and spatial products on the web that are no 
longer dependent on a base map image. 
 
The use of these standards in emerging platforms and services like Mapbox and Carto is 
creating a need for existing platforms and data stewards to update how they deliver data. 
127
There are steps by which community-driven standards may be further developed by the OGC
 and others – through pilot initiatives, for example. 
128129
 
 
The OGC and Association of Geographic Information have identified 
130131
several areas which will drive further standardisation: 
 
●As the value of geospatial data is realised beyond the geospatial 
community, we will see standards develop that facilitate 
interoperability with other domains​​, including BIM, smart cities, IoT 
and statistics. 
132
●As ​new technology and services​​ increase in capability, from hardware 
to bandwidth, standards are emerging that enable us to access and 
process data from new sources with increasing quality – such as HD 
133
and 3D vector maps, and APIs for sensors. 
134135
●As data volumes increase and new platforms emerge there will be a 
136
need for new standards and APIs to access and process large 
137
volumes of data for ​analytics and insights.

●Driven by a need to observe dynamic features, make predictions and 
carry out timestamped analytics, standards are being updated to 
introduce ​time and other dimensions​​ such as as those are used in 
environmental forecasting. 
138
 
 
While most geospatial data publication and use is well supported by existing standards, there 
are still some gaps. There are not many standards or specifications that define profiles of 
GeoJSON, GeoPackage or similar formats that describe how to publish data about specific 
types of spatial objects, by defining the attributes that would help describe public toilets
139
,electoral boundaries or parking locations, for example. More work to define these 
140
standards is needed to improve quality and consistency of geospatial data collection and 
publication. 
Which types of organisations are stewarding our data 
infrastructure?  
Like our physical infrastructure, a variety of different types of organisation are now stewards 
of our data infrastructure, as explained earlier in this report. Here, we use the term ‘data 
141
steward’ to describe the organisation accountable for collecting, maintaining, using and 
sharing data on specific subject matter. 
 
Similarly to how our weather data infrastructure has been changing, the stewardship of 
142
data infrastructure is evolving reflecting developments in policy and technology, making it 
easier for more organisations to collect and manage data.  
 
The UK’s geospatial data infrastructure involves a number of public and private sector 
organisations. As described in the ​section of this report on UK policy​, while Ordnance Survey 
has a key part to play as the national mapping agency, it is only one of many government 
organisations providing national information about the physical and built environment. 
Indeed, the organisations and communities involved reach far wider than the public sector. 
For example, OpenStreetMap is developed and maintained by a combination of volunteers 
and commercial organisations voluntarily providing employee time. Important parts of UK 
addressing data are owned by a private company and we see the increasing role of 
commercial organisations like Google, Microsoft and Apple in collecting, using and sharing 
geospatial data. 
143
 
In this section we briefly review the range of organisations that are now responsible and 
accountable for different aspects of the UK’s geospatial data infrastructure. 
Public data stewards 
Ordnance Survey is the national mapping agency for Great Britain (England, Scotland and 
Wales). While data stewarded by Ordnance Survey provides important information about the 
natural and built environment, other nationally important geospatial data assets are owned 
and managed by a variety of other government departments and agencies. The following list 
identifies a few of these public sector organisations:

●Ordnance Survey​ – the national mapping agency for England, Scotland and Wales 
●Ordnance Survey Northern Ireland​ – the mapping agency for Northern Ireland 
●HM Land Registry​ – holds the national register on land and property ownership in 
England and Wales 
●UK Hydrographic Office​ – holds marine geospatial data for the UK  
●British Geological Survey​ – holds geological records for the UK 
●Coal Authority​ – holds data related to impacts of historical coal mining in the UK 
●Valuation Office Agency​ – holds data on property valuations for England, Scotland 
and Wales 
●Department for Transport​ – holds air, land and sea transport network data for 
England and Wales  
●Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs​ – holds data about the state of 
the natural environment in England through their Agencies, such as air quality, 
conservation, bathing waters, fish stocks, agriculture, flood, pollution, rivers 
●Natural Resources Wales​ – holds data about the state of the natural environment in 
Wales 
●Scottish Environmental Protection Agency​ – holds data about the state of the natural 
environment in Scotland 
 
These organisations focus on different regions or different aspects of our geographic 
environment. Local governments are another key steward of geospatial data. For example, 
important data about transport, communities, heritage and aspects of the environment are 
often managed by local authorities.  
 
The mix of public organisations stewarding and publishing geospatial data presents 
challenges for all types of data user – including businesses and other public sector bodies. It 
is not easy to find and aggregate data from across public sector stewards because. This is 
because: 
 
●data is fragmented across different geographic areas or reported at different levels of 
detail 
●data users may be unclear about which organisations are responsible for collecting 
and publishing the data they need 
●data is published using different technical platforms and in a variety of formats, 
including simple CSV files which are not well suited to geospatial data 
●data is difficult to discover because of varying quality in the way data is described 
and tagged, and because geospatial data services are not well indexed by search 
engines  
●there is a lack of commonly adopted standards that define common models 
(attributes) for spatial objects, as noted in the previous section. 
Commercial data stewards 
In the earlier section on global trends around geospatial data, we highlighted how technology 
trends are making it easier for commercial organisations of all types to collect and use 
geospatial data. 
 
There is a growing volume of geospatial data being collected by a variety of commercial 
organisations, such as data from sensors on telecommunications infrastructure, or building 
information that is produced and maintained by construction and engineering firms.  
 
Focusing on web mapping services and the data collected by mobile applications, we see 
that technology improvements mean that gaps in data coverage – or difficulties with 
interoperability of government data – can, and are, being filled by private-sector companies 
and communities.  
 
Google, Microsoft, Apple and Facebook all provide mapping services for developers building 
applications around their respective platforms, making it easier to integrate maps and 
location data into their products. Google and Microsoft also provide a number of 
general-purpose mapping APIs that provide access to additional features, including routing, 
business listings, etc. 
 
Open Data Institute 2018 / ReportThe UK’s geospatial data infrastructure: challenges and opportunities    31 

 
 
All of the major platforms use a mixture of open and non-open sources to build their mapping 
services. They are all investing in additional methods of data capture and collection to 
improve their offering, allowing them to provide not just 2D maps, but 3D models, street view 
and access to satellite imagery. 
 
Other commercial organisations such as Strava and Uber are using the georeferenced data 
contributed by their users to develop new geospatial products, such as Strava Metro and 
Uber Movement. In both of these cases, the target audience for their products is the public 
sector, as the data provides information about use of local transport networks that is 
otherwise unavailable. 
 
The data stewarded by these commercial organisation is not yet open, although may be 
accessible for free via freemium pricing models – where a product or service is provided free 
of charge, but additional features, services or goods are chargeable. 
 
A common restriction in the terms and conditions of use for commercial geospatial data is 
that users are restricted to using the data within the vendors’ platforms. For example, Google 
and Microsoft place restrictions on use – including integrating the provided data with other 
maps or using them for ‘high risk activities’, such as emergency services response. 
144
 
However, as we note in a later in the report, several large organisations are now publishing 
open geospatial data through their work with OpenStreetMap, a community-curated and 
open source mapping project aimed at creating an openly licensed map of the world. 
Community data stewards 
There are several interesting examples of community curated geospatial data assets. 
OpenStreetMap is the most well-known and pervasive of these.  
 
The initial driver for OpenStreetMap was the restricted distribution and accessibility of 
national mapping data stewarded by Ordnance Survey and others. It has since been adopted 
by communities around the world and has become part of the global geospatial data 
infrastructure. It has also paved the way for other commons-based projects that collect 
additional types of geospatial data. For example: 
 
●OpenStreetCam​ – which supports community collection of street-level imagery 
●OpenAerialMap​ – a platform for publishing openly licensed imagery from drones and 
other unmapped aerial vehicles 
●Wheelmap​ and the recently launched ​Accessibility.Cloud​ – which support the 
collection and use of crowd-sourced data about the accessibility of public spaces. 
 
Crowdsourcing plays a key role in humanitarian mapping, and is used in response to 
disasters, disease outbreaks etc. The UK has active communities working as part of the 
Humanitarian OpenStreetMap​ team and charities like ​MapAction​.

Exploring parts of the UK’s 
geospatial data ecosystem 
This section explores two key stewards of the UK’s geospatial data infrastructure – Ordnance 
Survey and OpenStreetMap – and the ecosystems they support.  
 
There are many ways in which we could evaluate, compare and contrast these stewards – for 
example, by comparing approaches to data collection and publication to highlight potential 
interoperability issues.  
 
Instead, we have chosen to focus on how a variety of contributors, intermediaries and data 
users are creating value from the geospatial data stewarded by each organisation. We believe 
this provides a useful way to understand the relationships within the data ecosystems that 
they support. 
 
We have chosen to focus on Ordnance Survey and OpenStreetMap as example stewards of 
geospatial data infrastructure, as they reflect different communities and users. The following 
sections briefly describe the ecosystems that they support. The sections also link to an 
accompanying set of ecosystem diagrams. 
Ordnance Survey 
Ordnance Survey is a national mapping agency with responsibility for maintaining geospatial 
data for England, Scotland and Wales. Its staff of over 1,000 employees is responsible for 
145
stewarding data about Great Britain’s natural, man-made and administrative landscapes, 
including detailed data on terrain, roads, rivers and every fixed physical object to a high level 
of accuracy. 
 
This high-detail geospatial dataset is maintained through the work of its own survey teams 
and through the activities of several commercial partners responsible for specific aspects of 
data collection and maintenance. This includes provision of aerial photography, digital 
imagery, height datasets and topographic data. Additional data is provided to Ordnance 
Survey from other sources, primarily the public sector – the Land Registry, Environment 
Agency and local government. Address data is sourced from Geoplace and Royal Mail. 
 
Ordnance Survey is a ‘government-owned company’ and is required to generate revenue 
146
to be sustainable. This revenue comes from a mixture of licensing fees being charged for data 
and paid services both in the UK and internationally through ​Ordnance Survey International. 
147
Ordnance Survey produces several data products using the data that it curates internally. 
These products include OS AddressBase® and OS MasterMap. Ordnance Survey data 
products are available via bulk access and some are also accessible via some limited APIs.  
 
OS MasterMap consists of a number of separate smaller data products or layers, such as OS 
Greenspace, which can be individually licensed and accessed. However, data is often 
primarily accessed via its network of over 350 partner organisations, which provide additional 
value-added services over the data. These include Emapsite, Landmark, GetMapping and 
148
others. Some Ordnance Survey partners also offer additional services and products to 
support the collection and maintenance of geospatial data.

A number of Ordnance Survey products are made available for free use by public sector 
bodies via the ​Public Sector Mapping Agreement​ and the One Scotland Mapping Agreement. 
Ordnance Survey products are available directly under a range of additional licences that 
cover commercial usage of the data and its APIs, specialist product development​ licences​, 
and l​icences for the charity and third sector​. The products are also indirectly available 
through a network of 200 plus partners. 
 
In 2010, OS published its first 12 open datasets. In 2015, the list of openly licensed datasets 
grew to include data on roads, rivers and place names. In 2017, OS Open Greenspace was 
149
released. This review and update of greenspace data was partly funded by Sport England. All 
of the open data stewarded by Ordnance Survey is published under the Open Government 
Licence. 
 
The openly licensed datasets are specific products that have been designed for specific user 
needs. Some of the datasets contain less detail than is available in OS MasterMap – 
geometries have been summarised, attribution removed or simplified, and persistent 
identifiers removed. This lack of context, removal of detail of geospatial extents (boundaries 
and lines) limits the ways in which the data can be reused.  
 
Data users have reported that the costs of accessing data, complexity of licensing, and 
technical difficulties in using data have dissuaded some small businesses and startups from 
using Ordnance Survey products. Our recent research, ‘Discovering geospatial data user 
needs’, highlighted a number of these issues. 
150
 
Ordnance Survey provides support for startups using geospatial data via its incubator, 
Geovation, which was founded in 2015. They provide a range of technical support and 
training for geospatial businesses. The support and mentoring that Geovation provides is not 
limited to Ordnance Survey products: some of their supported startups have used 
OpenStreetMap while others have chosen to use commercial platforms like Google Maps. 
This reflects the needs of the individual businesses – the type of data required, their business 
model and plan for scaling. 
 
Ordnance Survey strongly focuses on quality, ensuring that the data they release is accurate. 
Product release cycles vary, some are updated more frequently based on customer needs, 
while others are updated every six weeks. The open data is released less frequently, typically 
two to three times per year. 
 
In 2018, the UK government announced that additional geospatial data would be made 
available under an open licence. This includes a new dataset on property extents (the 
151
geographic extent of a property, represented by a polygon) and some open identifiers 
(TOIDs). Other data from OS MasterMap will be freely available up to a threshold via a range 
of new APIs. Plans for how these APIs and new datasets will be made available are still 
developing, and the commitments are expected to be delivered by 2020.

We have produced an Ordnance Survey ecosystem map, which illustrates some aspects of 
the data ecosystem that exists around the Ordnance Survey’s data and services.

OpenStreetMap 
The OpenStreetMap project was founded in the UK in 2004, with the goal of creating an 
openly licensed map of the world. As mentioned, it was set up largely in response to the 
distribution and accessibility of the national mapping data stewarded by Ordnance Survey 
and others being restricted. Since then, it has grown into one of the most successful 
collaboratively maintained open datasets in the world. 
 
OpenStreetMap’s core technical infrastructure and data assets are maintained by a global 
community of volunteers. The map’s contributors include local mappers and a diverse mix of 
small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), startups, ​large commercial organisations, 
153
NGOs and humanitarian organisations. OpenStreetMap relies on membership fees, 
sponsorship and donations to support its ongoing operations.  
 
The ​OpenStreetMap Foundation was set up in 2006 to provide stewardship of 
154
OpenStreetMap’s core technical infrastructure, support fundraising and coordinate 
governance of the project. This work is mainly devolved to a range of individual working 
groups, focused on different aspects of the system – data, licensing, operations, membership 
etc.  
 
OpenStreetMap UK, a community interest company, was founded in December 2016 to 
155
support and promote OpenStreetMap in the UK, by encouraging businesses to contribute to 
and use the data. OpenStreetMap UK ​organises quarterly projects to focus on improving 
156
particular parts of the data, such as rights of way or addressing. There are also active 
regional chapters of the OpenStreetMap, such as ​Mappa Mercia​ in the West Midlands. 
 
As a collaboratively maintained dataset, OpenStreetMap’s accuracy and completeness 
depends on the work of its maintainers. People can contribute to the map in a variety of 
ways. Mappers survey their local areas using GPS devices, photography and other tools to 
collect new 'ground truth’ data, while others use freely available satellite imagery and desktop 
and online tools to help maintain the map.  
 
Openly licensed data from Ordnance Survey, local government and other sources is regularly 
used to add additional features and information. The openly licensed Ordnance Survey 
datasets have been incorporated into OpenStreetMap since their release. The 
OpenStreetMap dataset is licensed under the Open Database Licence which includes a 
‘sharealike’ a provision which requires copies or adaptations of a product or dataset to be 
released under the same or similar licence as the original. 
 
An increasing number of commercial organisations are now ​contributing to OpenStreetMap​.
 These contributions go beyond sponsorship of the project and community events. For 
157
example, Microsoft was among the first to release satellite imagery for use by the 
OpenStreetMap community and its images are now integrated into the default editor. 
Microsoft, Apple, Facebook and others also have small teams of editors working to improve 
and maintain the data. 
 
A ​range of tools and approaches are used to improve quality, assess accuracy and protect 
158
against vandalism of the data. Some recent high-profile vandalism of the data raised the 
159
visibility of how OpenStreetMap contributors and the ecosystem of services it supports were 
able to handle malicious edits.

The OpenStreetMap database has a number of technical limitations and issues for users. The 
data model, while simple, is not designed around existing open geospatial standards. The 
schema is often evolving and practices for tagging and describing features can vary nationally 
and internationally, making it more difficult to consistently extract data. By design, the data 
also does not include include persistent identifiers for geospatial features. Instead, 
contributors link OpenStreetMap features to external datasets, such as Wikidata. 
160
 
While OpenStreetMap is often updated by merging in open data from authoritative sources, 
bulk updates are typically discouraged by the community. There is instead an emphasis on 
contributors checking and validating data rather than blindly importing. 
 
There are a range of services that help to support the use of OpenStreetMap data. The 
OpenStreetMap Foundation provides a limited range of services including a tile service to 
support web mapping and a search engine, ​Nominatim​. These are provided under a 
fair-usage policy. These core services are supplemented by a range of community-created 
and run services, such as ​Geofabrik’s Data Extracts​ and a other commercial services, 
including ​OpenCageData​, ​OpenMapTiles​, and ​ThunderForest​.  
 
Mapbox​, a US based startup, is one of the most successful of these, providing a range of 
tools to support use of geospatial data in mobile devices, in the browser and through game 
engines. Through its work with OpenStreetMap, Mapbox has developed several open 
standards for using geospatial data on the web, which are being adopted more widely. 
 
Internationally OpenStreetMap is used in a variety of commercial services, including Bing 
Maps, Facebook and Telenav Scout. It provides an alternative and a supplement to 
commercial sources. In the UK, OpenStreetMap is used in a variety of small projects, as well 
as some commercial applications, such as ​Cycle Streets​, ​Cycle Travel​ and FixMyStreet.  
 
OpenStreetMap data is primarily used as a free, open basemap for online maps and some 
routing applications. Some companies are starting to use the data to implement parts of their 
services, while applications like Pokemon Go are examples of it being used in popular 
applications. The data is also used by various organisations that provide geospatial training 
and consulting services, such as Clearmapping and ITOWorld. It also supports a rich 
ecosystem of smaller community projects that explore local and national landmarks and 
cultural heritage.  
 
The use of a ‘sharealike’ licence discourages some commercial users from using 
OpenStreetMap data, as they often understand this to require them to release their own 
derived data, which some businesses are reluctant to do. To address this, the 
OpenStreetMap Licensing Working Group has created some community guidelines that 
highlight a range of use cases where the ‘sharealike’ provision does not apply. 
161
 
The ability to contribute and frequently update data within OpenStreetMap makes it possible 
for contributors to provide data which would not otherwise appear on Ordnance Survey or 
other national maps. The global coverage of the dataset also makes OpenStreetMap a good 
starting point for startups and businesses that need to scale globally.

Strengthening geospatial 
data infrastructure 
 
In this final section of the report, we draw on our review of the UK’s geospatial data 
infrastructure to offer recommendations for strengthening geospatial data in general, to make 
it more open, and to maximise its value to businesses and society. 
 
When producing this report we did not assess the UK's capability in geospatial skills and 
delivery, or the legislative environment and bodies that govern the UK's geospatial data 
infrastructure. Therefore the report does not make recommendations in these areas. Please 
visit ​theodi.org​ for our views on these, and other, topics. 
163
Remove friction caused by restrictive data licences 
As highlighted earlier in this report, geospatial data is used in many ways for many different 
purposes – from understanding our natural environment to efficiently planning traffic around 
our road networks.  
 
However, geospatial data is nearly always used in combination with other datasets. Data 
about location can be combined to provide new ways of analysing and viewing data from 
other sources. 
 
Geospatial data is often mixed with one or more other datasets, meaning that users 
frequently encounter issues with incompatible licences or permissions that limit how datasets 
can be combined. While some limits are necessary – to ensure that personally sensitive data 
is used legally and ethically – there are also some unnecessary points of friction in licences 
that limit forms of reuse, or restrict how derived data and insights can be shared with others.  
 
When the geospatial datasets themselves are not openly licensed so they can readily 
accessed, used and shared, this creates friction that reduces the benefits we stand to gain 
from collecting high-quality geospatial data. 
 
To maximise its value, we believe that geospatial data should be made as open as possible. 
Where data is not available under open licences, it is important that data stewards 
understand the impacts of non-open licences and work with their community to discuss and 
clarify licensing issues. 
164
 
At present, in the UK, the data users and wider ecosystems around both Ordnance Survey 
and OpenStreetMap data struggle with licensing issues, particularly around the publication 
and sharing of derived data. While the OS open data is published under a liberal licence, its 
commercial licensing limits the publication of derived data. As we have noted above, the 
‘sharealike’ provisions in the Open Database Licence used by OpenStreetMap discourage 
some commercial users. 
 
The OpenStreetMap community guidelines provide a useful resource that helps to clarify its 
165
licensing arrangements, while also highlighting the complexity of the system to international 
users.

The openly licensed identifiers and property extents datasets due to be released by Ordnance 
Survey demonstrate the kind of steps national mapping agencies need to take to unlock other 
data releases. That is by removing limitations on publication of derived data, for example. 
And, while freemium APIs can increase access to data by making it freely available to more 
users, unless steps are taken to simplify licensing and derived data terms, they do not directly 
address the issue of improved access.  
Link and standardise datasets to improve quality 
We have attempted in this report to tease out the range of data assets that are part of the 
UK’s geospatial data infrastructure. We have highlighted some of the key identifiers and 
datasets and have discussed both geospatial and georeferenced datasets. 
 
Other countries will have their own sets of data assets. Listing and describing them helps to 
identify how those different types of assets unlock value; and identify any issues that relate to 
where they might sit on the data spectrum. 
 
For example, geospatial identifiers and registers help to improve the quality, consistency and 
interoperability of other data assets. Identifiers and registers should be made as open as 
possible. Identifiers should be published with a core set of openly licensed reference data 
and made available via supporting services that help data users adopt and use them. This 
makes it easier to combine data from multiple sources. 
 
When geospatial datasets are made open they should not be stripped of identifiers. It 
removes the ability for reusers to connect this data with other sources, and limits their ability 
to consume a mixture of open and licensed data via commercial services. Nor should they 
include only identifiers, and not supporting information, when registers for those identifiers 
are not open. 
 
While there are existing and emerging international standards that support the publication 
and use of geospatial data, there is still a need to create smaller sets of standards that use 
schemas or ‘profiles’ of existing standards to support specific communities to collect and 
publish data. While the Local Government Association, for example, has carried out existing 
work in this area already, eg creating standards for planning and licensing applications, 
166
there is a need for additional work to create new standards and drive adoption. 
Ensure ethical and equitable access to geospatial data 
We have highlighted how the ubiquity of mobile and sensor devices is allowing commercial 
organisations to track individuals with ever-greater precision. This data is being used in a 
variety of ways to create and improve geospatial data products and to deliver services to 
users.  
 
However – as with the release of New York taxi trip data and privacy issues in the Strava 
167
Metro dataset – concerns over the sharing of personal location data from mobile applications 
have highlighted the need for stronger ethical frameworks around the collection and sharing 
of location data. 
168
 
While a recent survey by the ODI highlighted that consumers are prepared to make trade-offs 
to share data about themselves in return for societal benefit, a 2018 survey by HERE

Technologies highlighted that many people feel concerned about sharing location data and 
do not trust how data is being used or that it is adequately protected. 
170
 
People are more willing to share data about them if they understand how it will be used. If 
171
individuals become unwilling to share location data, then this will impact the ability for that 
data to be used in ways that create economic and social benefits. When aggregated, 
information about people’s movements can help to improve quality of maps, inform transport 
and mobility policy or increase road safety. 
 
Commercial organisations collecting this data need to be transparent about how and when 
data is being used. Policymakers and geospatial data stewards across the public and private 
sectors will need to work together to define policy, create guidance and adopt common 
standards and frameworks. Doing so will ensure we can maximise the value of this data while 
limiting and protecting against any potential harmful impacts. 
Innovative business models will sustain a more open 
infrastructure  
Our geospatial data infrastructure needs to be reliable, up to date and sustainable over the 
long term. Moving towards a more open ecosystem, from one primarily based on data 
licensing fees, creates challenges for how we ensure sustainable stewardship and access to 
geospatial data assets. 
 
This is not a unique challenge for geospatial data. For example, national meteorological 
services around the world are facing similar challenges around how they deliver on a public 
task which is best supported by openly licensed data, while ensuring that they can continue 
to invest in data collection and support use of that data by the widest possible set of 
consumers.  
 
In some countries, including Israel and Norway, those public bodies have chosen to focus 
purely on their core public tasks and release only open data, leaving the provision of other 
services entirely to the private sector.  
172
 
National mapping agencies will also need to innovate around both their business models and 
approaches to publishing data. 
173
 
Debates about the role of the state and how to fund access to data continue, even when the 
value and benefits of making it open are well documented. For example, the Australian 
government reported that more than 40% of users of their national address file only started 
using it once it became open and available in an aggregated standard format. The report 
174
notes that 73% of users indicated that they had improved in productivity or efficiency as a 
result.  
 
Despite the well-documented value of opening up Landsat data in the US, debates still 
continue about whether it should be chargeable. In 2012, the National Geospatial Advisory 
Committee concluded that Landsat provides ‘a huge return on the taxpayers’ investment’ 
175
and in 2014 the same body found that ‘the economic value of just one year of Landsat data 
far exceeds the multi-year total cost of building, launching, and managing Landsat satellites

and sensors.’ The 2012 review went so far as to conclude that charging for Landsat data 
176
would stifle research in a diverse range of fields, negatively impact national security, and, 
ultimately, waste money.  
 
However, it was recently revealed that the US Department of the Interior has asked the US 
177
Geological Survey (USGS) to ‘​consider possibilities for fee recovery/cost sharing’ for Landsat 
imagery, despite advances in technology bringing the cost of doing so down to near zero. 
178
Critics of the proposed move note that the cost of actually collecting payments is still rather 
high. In the words of one recently-retired former USGS remote-sensing scientist: “​it 
179180
costs a lot of money to charge money​”. 
 
This raises questions around the role of government, the expectations of what types and level 
of services it could or should provide, and the extent to which it should compete with the 
private sector in providing data services.  
 
In the UK in 2006, the Office of Fair Trading recommended that a distinction should be made 
between unrefined information provided equitably by the state; and value-added information 
or services around which there could be competition. An evaluation of the impact of this 
181
study in 2014 stressed that several of those recommendations to improve competition were 
not yet implemented. In the UK, these issues are still being navigated by the government 
182
and Ordnance Survey, particularly in relation to its network of partners and resellers. 
 
The issue of how and when to charge for access to data is not limited to the public sector. As 
highlighted in this report, a range of data stewards collect and manage data assets that are 
part of our critical data infrastructure.  
 
There are opportunities to explore alternative business models that will help to ensure 
sustainable access to open geospatial data. For example: 
 
●charging for warranties and quality assurance 
●charging for support and consulting around use of data 
●charging for API access and/or tailored online services to enable on-demand use of 
data within specific sectors or types of application 
●charging for specialised data collection or resurveying of data 
●collaborative maintenance and shared curation of data to remove duplication and 
increase data quality, accuracy and timeliness – as demonstrated by 
legislation.gov.uk.  
183
Use open approaches to avoid a closed ecosystem 
The increasing collection of geospatial and georeferenced data by commercial organisations 
also creates both challenges and opportunities.  
 
There are opportunities because there are more datasets, products and services available. A 
thriving marketplace of geospatial data providers and services can help to create more 
valuable applications.

However the pace of innovation around data collection and analysis creates risks that 
commercial organisations may outstrip the ability for national bodies to do the same, unless 
there is sufficient investment. There are risks that, even if our infrastructure becomes more 
open, commercial sources could supplant or replace it because they provide higher-quality 
data, or services that better meet users’ needs but with closed datasets. This trend is already 
developing, as evidenced by the widespread adoption of Google Maps.  
 
There are a variety of ways in which we can navigate away from a more closed data 
infrastructure: 
 
●Ensuring that core infrastructure components such as identifiers, registers and 
standards are as open as possible, while respecting privacy, will help them become 
adopted in commercial services, reducing potential for platform lock-in. 
●Publishing open geospatial data assets will help to create a more balanced 
marketplace that will avoid commercial stewards having a monopoly over specific 
types of data assets. 
●Scaling up support for startups and SMEs in using open geospatial data from across 
our data infrastructure will help to create maximum value from open sources. 
●Legislation or other methods to encourage commercial organisations to use open 
identifiers and standards, to publish data openly, or share it with other organisations 
– eg to reduce costs of data collection.  
184
●Extending models of shared stewardship – across the public and private sectors, and 
between governments – might help reduce costs and deliver value. 
Recognise OpenStreetMap as a link to a global 
geospatial data infrastructure 
Each nation’s geospatial data infrastructure is part of a global infrastructure. OpenStreetMap 
has become a key component of that global infrastructure.  
 
Local and national governments around the world are working with the OpenStreetMap 
community to ensure that geospatial data is available to that community and the growing 
ecosystem it supports. 
 
Large commercial organisations like Apple, Microsoft and Facebook build OpenStreetMap 
into their mapping services. Companies such as Lyft, Telenav and Mapbox are using it as 
essential part of their products. In all cases, these commercial users recognise the symbiotic 
relationship and contribute  to OpenStreetMap, as well as using it, to improve the map for 
everyone.  
 
To help to meet a broader range of data user needs, governments should ensure that openly 
licensed geospatial data is readily available to the OpenStreetMap community, ensuring that 
OpenStreetMap coverage in their countries is as high-quality as possible. The rich ecosystem 
of community groups, small businesses, and larger organisations supported by 
OpenStreetMap means that it has become a useful way to share geospatial data with a 
broader audience, and a key steward of geospatial data infrastructure, as explained earlier in 
this report. 
 
Even where licensing of public sector data is already compatible with OpenStreetMap, and 
there are no legal barriers to the reuse of the data, there are still additional areas of 
collaboration to explore: 
 
●Coordination with the OpenStreetMap community on projects to perform bulk 
imports of public sector data. 
●Tagging OpenStreetMap features with relevant geospatial identifiers used within the 
country.
