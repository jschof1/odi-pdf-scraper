Executive summary 
Data could drive global economic growth for decades to come, but little is 
known about how countries can turn their use of it into trade competitiveness. 
Up to two billion people might now be using cloud computing to store digital 
information, while greater access to public and private data across the world could 
create as much as $3tn in annual value for the global economy.
,,
 But what can 
131415
countries do to capture that value through the data-enabled goods and services that 
they sell abroad?  
 
This report discusses how data infrastructure might be built for trade 
competitiveness. ​Countries can approach the construction of data infrastructure 
with a variety of objectives. The discussion here explores what policymakers might 
consider as they seek to boost the exports of domestic companies that are using 
data to create and maintain goods and services. The report broaches the key 
questions of how easy it is for domestic producers of data-enabled goods and 
services to find potential buyers abroad; the incentives that such companies have in 
developing new products; their level of access to production factors, such as data; 
16
how many support services, such as research and data science, are available to them 
as they seek to grow and sell abroad; and how trade promotion schemes might help.  
 
Some countries are already trying to gain an advantage in data-enabled 
technology in the hope that it will lead to long-term trade competitiveness. ​The 
United States (US) has established itself as a leader in the collection, analysis, and 
use of data in digital services such as those offered by Amazon, Facebook, and 
Google. But countries such as Germany are rapidly trying to catch up in the use of 
data-enabled technology in the transport sector, while countries as diverse as Japan 
and Kenya are developing national strategies for the exploitation of data through 
artificial intelligence.  Canada is spending C$3bn in its Ontario province alone to 
1718
help it better compete in internationally competitive digital services.  
19
 
Trust in the use of data may have become a point of trade competitiveness in 
data-enabled goods and services in recent years. ​The European Union’s (EU’s) 
General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)​ ​is partly about showing that EU countries 
have high-quality data-use standards, and can exchange data in a trustworthy 
manner. The United Nations Conference on Trade and Development has 
recommended that countries around the world seek to establish data-exchange 
relationships with their trading partners that are based on being open about data 
collection and why data is being collected; and allowing data subjects to access and

correct data about them. Those nations or groups of countries that establish 
20
reputations for good data infrastructure in the years to come may find that they 
benefit from more international data exchange and hence access to better data.  
 
In recent years, countries have tried to benefit more from data-enabled 
exchange, aided by trade agreements that enable cross-border data flows. ​The 
Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership between 11 
countries on either side of the Pacific, for example, includes stipulations about 
cross-border data flows that favour international commerce. With such agreements, 
21
countries will be better able to find opportunities for specialisation, although such 
benefits may be impeded in the future by moves across the world for personal data to 
be stored in the country in which it was collected – and only physically accessible in 
that country. Domestic storage of personal data is supported by large majorities of 
people in Indonesia, China, India, Mexico and Poland.  
22
 
Some countries are already fostering competition and entrepreneurialism in 
data-enabled sectors as a way to produce competitive products. ​Australia, for 
example, has put data exploitation at the centre of its economic strategy and has 
recognised that companies become more competitive abroad if they are subject to 
the pressure of competition at home. But this is in the face of seemingly dominant 
23
positions in markets for social media and other digital services, held by large US 
companies such as Facebook. There are ongoing discussions about such issues in 
the EU, the US, and the United Kingdom (UK), and it is possible that the countries 
which are most able to increase competition in data-enabled sectors – perhaps 
through data-portability schemes – could enjoy a future competitive advantage. 
24
 
If countries are to produce data-enabled goods and services that are 
competitive abroad, domestic companies need access to data. ​Australia’s 2015 
Public Data Policy Statement, for example, encouraged public organisations to open 
data so that it could be used by entrepreneurs as they develop new goods and 
services. Citymapper, an urban transport service that uses data to help travellers to 
25
optimise their routes, grew out of Transport for London publishing realtime timetable 
and location data from across its network as open data, and the service has since 
spread to cities around the world.  
26
 
Countries that have physical infrastructure that allows easy creation and 
exporting of data-enabled goods and services could have a competitive 
advantage.​ Data centres, for example, allow companies to securely store and 
analyse information that is highly sensitive to operations in the financial and 
healthcare sectors. Giving access to them through a wide variety of cloud computing 
services can allow companies to keep costs down. But the costs of building data 
centres across the world can differ substantially and therefore affect competitiveness

– perhaps varying by as much as $60.9m in Brazil, $51.2m in Chile, and $43m in the 
US. 
27
 
There are many complementary services and skills that help companies to 
produce data-enabled products, and hence make them competitive in 
international markets.​ This might mean access to a variety of data platforms that 
help companies to collate and analyse data, or being able to employ data scientists 
with the right domain experience. It could also mean being able to work with research 
organisations like university departments as they seek to develop frontier technology 
that could be commercialised – something which Hong Kong is positioning itself for 
as it establishes research centres on healthcare, artificial intelligence and robotics. 
28
 
29
 
As companies develop data-enabled products, governments can play their 
traditional trade promotion role. ​There is currently little focus of such efforts on 
data-enabled sectors, with the UK–Australia FinTech Bridge being probably the 
30
leading example: it seeks to increase market access and regulatory coordination 
between the two countries, particularly for the companies that have emerged 
alongside the UK’s open banking initiative and have business models built on 
trustworthy access to high-quality data. Many countries have schemes for promoting 
digital trade, and these could be expanded to promote their data infrastructure in 
years to come.  
 
Developing some of these features while building data infrastructure could help 
many countries to raise their trade competitiveness.​ Doing so might help 
countries around the world to grow firms that can more readily compete with the 
large digital firms that already exist, perhaps developing services that become 
popular through trustworthy data use. But this is a young research area for trade 
policymakers, and so far all that is really known is that poor data standards or 
constricted data flows in countries such as Brazil might be costing the country as 
much as 4% of its annual investment; and China and Indonesia as much as 1.5% of 
their exports.

Introduction 
Data could drive global economic growth for decades to come, but what that 
means for how countries should trade data-enabled goods and services is 
unclear. ​The rise of large digital companies like Google and Alibaba has shown that 
selling goods and services, collecting data about their users, and creating better 
products thereafter can be a tremendously competitive business model. But it is hard 
to unpick whether that means countries that want to maximise their competitiveness 
should have strong data-protection laws; allow easy flow of data across borders; or 
concentrate on only a few data-enabled activities, now that developed countries have 
moved so far ahead.  
 
Data infrastructure offers policymakers a framework for understanding how the 
treatment and sharing of data might affect trade competitiveness.​ In the past two 
years organisations such as the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and 
Development (OECD) and the European Centre for International Political Economy 
have pioneered analysis of the use of data in international trade, discussing rules on 
data collection and cross-border exchange. The discussion here builds on these 
efforts by considering all aspects of data infrastructure, and how they might be 
understood in trade-competitiveness terms.  
 
Data infrastructure is the equivalent of infrastructure for transportation and 
utilities. ​It consists of datasets, identifiers and registers, the standards and 
technologies used to curate and provide access to those data assets, and the 
guidance and policies that inform the use and management of them. There are 
32
organisations that govern data infrastructure and groups involved in contributing to or 
maintaining it. In the same way that good transport infrastructure makes it easier to 
move around, meet people, and run businesses, high-quality data infrastructure 
allows more exploitation of data for economic and social benefits.  
 
Data infrastructure improves exploitation of data’s unique features. ​Some types 
of data can be made excludable in that owners can prevent others from using it 
through security measures and intellectual property rights – described in the Open 
Data Institute theory of change as ‘data hoarding’. This is similar to how an oil 
33
company can prevent others from using its oil field, but it is not rivalrous and can be 
used by more than one person without being depleted. As digitised information – bits 
– in the form of data is a modern phenomenon, the world’s leading economies and 
data producers are only at the beginning of understanding how best to collect data 
and produce economic growth through better goods and services built on data.  
 
A country’s trade competitiveness is its ability to sell its goods and services 
abroad. ​Trade competitiveness is a ‘behind the border’ notion, meaning that it 
34
considers the domestic conditions for innovation and optimisation in goods and 
services and how they enable countries to raise the value they get from their exports.

 A standard definition of export competitiveness, popularised by the OECD, is the degree to which, under 
open market conditions, a country can produce goods and services that meet the test of foreign 
competition while simultaneously maintaining and expanding domestic real income. See World Bank 
(2012), ‘Trade Competitiveness Diagnostic Toolkit’,

 Data infrastructure is also often a domestic consideration, as it has so far involved 
35
more national rather than international coordination of laws, standards, ethics, and 
skills for the collection and manipulation of data, not least as some data is only 
collected and used at the local or national levels.  
 
Estimates of cross-border flows of data and their values have increased 
substantially in recent years.
,
 The International Monetary Fund has identified the 
3637
use of data as one of five issues that need to be better understood if measurements 
of digital trade can be improved on, and the estimates are wide: up to 2 billion people 
might now be using cloud computing to store digital information, up from around 1.1 
billion in 2014; and annual per capita growth in OECD countries between 1996 and 
2007 is thought to have risen by 0.9–1.5 percentage points with every 10 
percentage-point increase in broadband reach.
,,
 But the range of these and other 
383940
estimates for the effects of data on economic growth has been so wide that 
organisations such as the US Chamber of Commerce doubt their usefulness.
,
 
4142
 
Cross-border data use has accelerated because the World Wide Web spread 
the internet quickly and in unlikely ways, greatly expanding international trade. 
The web was invented by Sir Tim Berners-Lee – co-founder of the Open Data 
Institute – with an ethos of openness that is also at the heart of free trade. It gave 
43
billions of people around the world an almost free platform on which to exchange 
ideas, goods, and services, creating enormous wealth gains. 
 
The nature of modern international commerce means that data infrastructure 
questions arise quickly.​ When data is being transferred from a consumer to a 
company, it might happen through identifiers and registers in one country but with 
standards and technology used to curate and provide access to those data assets 
from another country. A third country might become involved through its guidance 
and policies being used for the management of data assets. And above these 
national considerations, international bodies like the EU could have a role. 
Consumers can therefore be affected by decisions about the governance and policies 
surrounding data made in any one, or all of the three possible countries.  
44
 
The rest of the discussion explores the links between data infrastructure and 
trade competitiveness in several steps. ​The next section raises issues of data

 The difficulty in estimating data flows may mean that policymakers are underestimating their importance. 
Unlike for digital services, the receipt of an amount of data is not recorded in official statistics as payments 
are only made for the digital service received. The value of the data is captured in the service, but the fact 
that data is not explicitly recorded in trade statistics may mean that policy-makers are insufficiently 
focused on the data aspects of trade agreements, and impediments to the flow of data across borders.

openness, the nature of data, and restrictions on its cross-border exchange in recent 
years. The sections thereafter define data infrastructure, and delineate its parts 
according to the classic elements of assessing trade competitiveness: market 
access; incentives for trade and investment; factor conditions; intermediate inputs 
and backbone services; and trade promotion. Considering these issues could help 
policymakers around the world to consider how they might start incorporating data 
infrastructure considerations into their trade competitiveness strategies.

Data openness and 
international trade 
Data can be plotted on a spectrum of how open it is for others to use. ​The Data 
Spectrum below shows that access to a dataset can be closed to anyone but those 
in a specified group of people, such as the staff of a company; more open when 
access is granted to further groups; and highly accessible or open to anyone around 
the world when certain licences are used.  
 
Figure 1: The Data Spectrum 
 
 
 
Personal data can be found at both ends of the spectrum and believing that it is 
never open data is a common misperception. ​There are everyday examples of 
45
personal data that is openly available, such as data about elected representatives, 
and judgements often need to be made over whether such data is also sensitive and 
could cause serious harm to an organisation or person if it is released. Sharing 
personal data has long motivated data protection laws around the world, and the 
EU’s Digital Single Market strategy has distinguished non-personal data – such as on 
transport timetables – from personal data in an attempt to simplify research. 
46
 
The economic benefits of open data have been documented by several studies.
 A report in 2011 for the European Commission found that with easier access to and

use of public sector information, its value to the EU economy could be as high as 
1.7% of GDP. In Britain the value of such data has been estimated at around £7bn, 
48
while greater access to public and private data across the world could create as 
much as $3tn in annual value for the global economy.  
49
 
‘Big data’ is a mix of personal and non-personal data. ​The excitement about 
50
large amounts of data is often about what can be discovered about human behaviour 
under different conditions. For example, combining non-personal data about the 
weather with personal data about the characteristics of people and where they take 
holidays could enable better personalised holiday offerings. But determining if data is 
about personal characteristics can be a delicate task – is train timetable data about 
an inanimate vehicle, or a link to other things that are known about the people on it?  
 
Data access can provoke national security concerns. ​Whether in the form of raw 
data or data used in products and services, cyber attacks for stealing digitised 
information in the form of intellectual property have caused estimated annual losses 
of around $12bn for countries such as the US. Identity theft creates consumer 
51
mistrust and introduces friction into data sharing and digital services. In 2017 a 
personal-data breach at the financial services company, Equifax, affected about 143 
million US consumers, and this is regularly cited as a reason by consumers for not 
using online financial services. A recent Open Data Institute report on 
52
anonymisation described how the use of Strava, a fitness tracking app, by American 
and British military personnel had revealed the location of their military bases.  
53
 
Discussion of cross-border data flows in digital goods and services and its 
sensitivity is now several decades long. ​In 1980 the OECD warned against the 
misuse of large databases and noted that misalignment between countries’ 
regulatory regimes on data could impede cross-border working. In 1981 the Council 
54
of Europe called for data privacy laws and considered the restrictions that countries 
might place on the export of data for processing elsewhere.  
 
The value of data to international commerce means that restricting the flow of 
data can suppress economic activity.​ Enacted or proposed regulatory restrictions 
on data flows could be costing Brazil as much as 4% of its annual investment; and 
China and Indonesia as much as 1.5%of their exports. The Digital Trade

Restraints on data flows come in several forms. ​The European Centre for 
International Political Economy has undertaken a taxonomy of restrictions on 
cross-border data flows that suggests there has been a significant increase in 
restrictions in recent decades. The centre’s taxonomy is delineated by whether 
57
there are local storage and processing requirements or bans on data transfer; and 
restrictions that are conditional on the country receiving it or the data controller and 
data processor that is managing it.

The benefits of openness, questions of efficiency, and demands for personal 
and national security puts policymakers in what might be an iron triangle. An 
59
‘iron triangle’ represents the relationship between three performance criteria. With a 
high level of open sharing of data, economic learning and management efficiency are 
high but so are concerns about security. When data sharing is restricted, gains from 
its use will likely be reduced, and efficiency might be lower, but security concerns fall. 
Picking a point within the triangle is likely to be a process of long deliberation for 
many countries, alongside coordination with their trading partners.

Data infrastructure and 
international trade 
competitiveness 
Data infrastructure 
Building data infrastructure could offer a way to balance some of the trade-offs 
in international data exchange. ​The way that data is collected, stored, and used 
often makes it difficult for innovators to access, impeding the possibilities for 
‘combinatorial innovation’ – different innovations working together – for economic 
and social ends. But using elements of data infrastructure could allow countries to 
61
find a balance between restricting and enabling access to data, which may provide 
competitive advantage in the future. Data infrastructure consists of: 
 
●data assets such as datasets, identifiers and registers 
●the standards and technologies used to curate and provide access to those 
data assets 
●the guidance and policies that inform the use and management of data 
assets and the data infrastructure itself 
●the organisations that govern the data infrastructure 
●the communities involved in contributing to or maintaining it, and those who 
are affected by decisions that are made using it. 
 
Registers are datasets that provide consistent, accurate and up-to-date lists of 
information across a variety of activities. They typically have basic information 
62
about a dataset, and examples include lists of countries and government 
departments, companies and food types. For example, the Harmonized Commodity 
63
Description and Coding System for classifying products helps companies and 
countries around the world to identify products, helping them to work from a 
common understanding of the types of goods being traded.  
 
When standards for data are open, policymakers can enjoy lower coordination 
costs.​ Data standards can be created for technical, economic and policy reasons, 
such as the Open Contracting Data Standard, which is helping to create transparency 
around public spending in Paraguay and Nigeria. Another example is the General 
64
Transit Feed Specification, a commonly used means for collecting and sharing data 
on transit systems, that is particularly used in transport applications and other 
services in cities around the world. Making an agreement reusable reduces the need 
for negotiation over how data will be used, increasing the amount of data available to 
data users and improving usability.

There is still some way to go before data standards, identifiers, and registers 
are open and accepted enough to link countries in data-enabled trade. ​Many 
66
low- and middle-income countries lack the means to use data and build competitive 
data-enabled services provided by firms from high- and upper-middle-income 
countries, such as the US, the UK and China. The Web Foundation, in a review of 
low- and middle-income countries, has shown that progress on introducing 
appropriate safeguards and regulation is mixed.  
67
 
Attitudes to data ethics and data governance are affecting trade 
competitiveness in ways that are currently difficult to judge. ​Data ethics is a 
branch of ethics that evaluates data practices with the potential to adversely affect 
people and society – in data collection, sharing and use. Invoking ethics and privacy 
68
considerations in the international exchange of data may be a question of 
protectionism, but some have argued that data-privacy regulation may not even be a 
legitimate topic for economists to consider.  
69
 
Restricting data exchanges due to privacy-violation concerns can be an element 
of a classic trade problem: incomplete contracts.​ An incomplete contract is an 
agreement for exchange that does not cover all of the possible actions by the parties 
involved, and therefore affects the nature of the agreement that the parties are willing 
to enter. This is relevant to data transfers, because there are numerous examples of 
70
companies using data about consumers in ways that the consumers did not expect. 
Restrictions on cross-border data exchange may suffer from the same problem, in 
that some countries are restricting access to data about their citizens because they 
do not have sufficient control over how that data will be used abroad. If this is the 
case, it may explain why agreements for data exchange tend to be for only simple 
products and services.  
71
 
Countries which cannot credibly commit to international data-exchange 
agreements could become less integrated in digital-trade flows. ​The ability of a 
country to enforce contracts – for an agreement between companies to be followed, 
or for a legal system to force a reneging company to follow the contract – has long 
been seen as central to economic growth. Sensitivity with regard to personal data 
72
might mean that in data-enabled international trade, countries with weak legal 
regimes will suffer from lower innovation, investment and firm dynamism.

The rapid development of data-enabled technology means that some 
sector-specific data infrastructure is emerging. ​In the same way that countries 
can reach an appropriate balance between openness and efficiency for data 
exchange relative to the nature of the data being used, sectors such as healthcare 
and agriculture can do the same. Examples include open banking initiatives in the UK 
and Mexico, which have created industry bodies for coordinating technology use and 
judging consumer appetite for the use of personal data.  
74
Trade competitiveness 
Data infrastructure enables a country to become more internationally 
competitive in producing data-enabled goods and services.​ Access to and 
exploitation of data could drive economic dynamism for years to come. Countries 
around the world have some strategic choices to make about: whether they want to 
share data with others; the reputation they want for how they use data; whether they 
will develop labour skills for working with it; if they are going to keep data confined to 
a small number of large firms, or have it accessible to entrepreneurs; and much else 
besides. 
 
The World Bank’s Trade Competitiveness Diagnostic Toolkit is an authoritative 
way to analyse trade competitiveness. The toolkit has a diagnostic framework, 
75
and a three-step process for guiding national policymakers who want to understand 
how well exports are competing in foreign markets; what might be affecting 
performance and how the export of goods and services could deliver more value. The 
resulting analysis can be used across countries, for example, to help Russia 
understand whether it exports more than natural resources and why it might not; and 
Bangladesh to see if its success in the export of garments could suggest ways for it 
to be more competitive in other sectors.  
 
The toolkit framework is used here to consider how data infrastructure might 
affect trade competitiveness. ​An advantage of using the toolkit is that it has been 
comprehensively tested in many low- and middle-income countries – such as Brazil, 
Georgia, and across South Asia. This opens the possibility that more can be learned 
about the effects of data infrastructure on poverty, and allows easier comparisons 
across countries using the World Bank’s data across a familiar framework. 
76
Competitiveness diagnostics for developed countries use essentially the same 
framework – each seeks to answer primary questions about macro incentives, 
backbone services and transaction costs, and government and market failures – but 
with more information available allowing deeper investigation of some issues.

Macro incentives 
Macro incentives are the first diagnostic question that the toolkit raises for data 
infrastructure. ​In classic trade terms, macro incentives are about tariffs, exchange 
77
rates, taxes, labour markets, product and factor markets, property rights, regulation, 
and how easy it is to establish and close down an enterprise. Some of these, such as 
property rights and the regulation of large data-enabled companies such as Google, 
are at the centre of discussions about data infrastructure in many countries.  
 
Debates over data ownership – property rights – have been ongoing for years, 
and using data rights may be the most economically efficient way to resolve the 
question. ​In the 1970s, Richard Posner, a law and economics academic at the 
University of Chicago, argued that it was inefficient to treat public information about a 
person as owned by that person – as doing so would lead to substantial bureaucracy 
in establishing, say, whether a photographer could use the image of many people in a 
public place without asking for their permission first. Acknowledging that data 
78
subjects have rights over data about them – which might also be about lots of other 
people – and that data users have responsibilities to those data subjects, might be a 
better way, although this raises the question of legal regimes and incomplete 
contracts mentioned above.  
79
 
Factor inputs are the resources that companies use to create products and 
services. ​Data is a factor input, but not in the same way as other factor inputs. It is 
non-rivalrous (supply is not affected by use) but with some business models – such 
as Amazon’s – companies collect consumer data to greatly increase their ability to 
target new consumers and offer better services, sometimes leading to a dominant 
position in the market. That raises questions about competition and access to data 
as a factor input for the creation and improvement of goods and services. Increasing 
the ease of porting data between companies – perhaps directed by consumers as 
they switch from one digital service to another, and using open application 
programming interfaces (APIs) – could be a way to increase domestic competition 
and raise export competitiveness.  
80
Backbone services and transaction costs 
The second diagnostic question that the toolkit raises for data infrastructure is 
around ‘backbone services’ and ‘transaction costs’. ​Difficulties faced regarding 
81
developing and trading goods and services - domestically or across borders - are 
described as ‘transaction costs’. 
 
Reducing transaction costs can make production significantly cheaper, thereby 
increasing the price competitiveness of a product in a foreign market.​ For 
example, easy access to intellectual property lawyers or experts on consumer

demand in another country, can make it simpler for a firm to judge whether and how 
to sell into that country; and being able to rely on a trade agreement that has 
established commercial rules for working with a company in another jurisdiction can 
have a similar effect.  
 
Access to data science skills is a well-known example of a backbone data 
infrastructure service. ​If a company has been collecting data for years – for example 
on the productivity of its farms – and wants to use it to make better planting and 
sales decisions, it may need the expertise of a data scientist to help analyse the data, 
perhaps also developing a software application to help staff make decisions with the 
data. The data scientists will be better able to deliver those improvements if they are 
operating in a clear legal framework for data use, and have had industry-standard 
training that allows experts to quickly start working together. There are a range of 
other data skills and career paths. 
82
Government and market failures  
The third diagnostic question that the toolkit raises for data infrastructure is 
around policies for overcoming government and market failures.​ For data policy 
these tend to involve coordination issues like open standards, which help to connect 
companies and share market information through shared language, common 
technology formats, and use guidance – that might not have been possible without 
them.  
83
 
Special economic zones might be a future development for data standards. 
Such zones are a common attempt by governments around the world to locate, say, 
high-technology companies in one place to take advantage of some local skills, 
collaborate, and create ‘knowledge externalities’ – positive spillover of new and 
innovative knowledge that benefit entrepreneurs. And given that special economic 
zones are often a way to improve a small part of a country’s business environment – 
like Shenzen in China or the Subic Bay Freeport Zone in the Philippines – they could 
be used to store data and determine access to it in countries with weak legal 
regimes.  
  
The sections below use the toolkit to consider data infrastructure with several 
classic aspects of trade competitiveness. ​These are: market access; incentives for 
trade and investment; factor conditions; intermediate inputs and backbone services; 
and trade promotion.  
Market access 
Market access is the ease with which a company in one country can sell to a 
consumer in another. ​Tariffs and non-tariff barriers affect the ease of access, and 
are raised by charges, indirect barriers, standards, quantitative restrictions, and 
contingent protection; or lowered by trade agreements and market coordination 
measures. Together, these affect the cost of entering an international market – the

amount a company has to pay to get its product to a consumer – and the risk of 
doing so.  
85
 
Digital platforms have created substantial international markets, improving 
producers’ access to international consumers. ​Amazon connects producers and 
consumers across many countries, while ‘gig economy’ sites such as Upwork link 
freelancers with new clients locally and internationally, in ways that were unheard of a 
few decades ago. Such platforms have used their ‘two-sided’ role to increase the 
efficiency with which market participants can connect with each other, often helping 
to reduce price dispersion.  
86
 
Data standards make it easier for companies to benefit from ‘network effects’.  
87
A ​‘network​ ​effect’ is the effect that an additional user of a product or service has on 
the value of that product or service. Network effects were most famously apparent in 
the spread of telephone networks, when the value of telephones to each user 
increased as more people owned telephones and joined the network. Facebook has 
connected millions of people, making it more valuable to existing and new users, and 
has created tools for developers that allows them to link more services and people – 
and related data – to the network.  
 
Trade agreements are a way of increasing market access through coordination.
 ​They are the result of discussions between two or more countries about how they 
88
might reduce tariffs and restrictions on the sale of goods in their respective markets, 
but also about reducing trade frictions through the mutual recognition of standards. 
For example, the North American Free Trade Agreement sought to align some of the 
labour environmental production standards between Canada, Mexico, and the US, 
helping to boost trade between the countries from $290bn when the agreement was 
signed in 1993 to $1.1tn in 2016. 
89
 
Some recent trade agreements have included stipulations against a new type of 
non-tariff barrier: data localisation. ​Non-tariff barriers raise the costs for a firm 
90
selling into a country, but without requiring direct payment of tariffs, and include 
requirements by countries such as China and Russia that data collected about their 
citizens must be stored in their countries. This mandates the data-collecting firms to 
maintain separate data storage and perhaps lose the benefits of being able to use 
some cloud services, analyse the information elsewhere and share it efficiently with 
commercial partners across the world. The Comprehensive and Progressive

 The OECD has categorised data storage requirements. They can run from no requirements; to a 
requirement for data storage with no stipulation with regard to the flow of data; to the additions of requiring 
data to be processed in the jurisdiction or that it be used in all circumstances in the jurisdiction. See

 Data localisation requirements can be imposed on non-personal data forms as well, as with the United

Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership between 11 countries on either side of the 
Pacific prohibits data localisation measures.’  
92
 
Data-localisation requirements may act in the same way that local content 
stipulations do. ​A requirement for a company to use a local supplier during 
93
production reduces the range and possible quality of inputs and services available, 
and is likely to push up costs and inhibit the quality of the final product. Depending 
on the nature of a data-localisation requirement, it may stipulate that a company has 
to store data in a local facility that perhaps is less secure than an international facility, 
or that may use inferior technology than its international equivalent.  
 
Data-localisation requirements affect a range of sectors. ​The ease of data flow – 
including personal data – affects a broad range of sectors from mining, consumer 
products and manufacturing, to healthcare retail. Small firms are the most affected 
94
in some instances – such as those running communication services – as they are not 
so able to tailor their practices to specific countries compared to big firms. But it 
does not impact only on small firms: there is evidence that data-localisation 
requirements have caused many types of firms to cease operations in foreign 
jurisdictions, perhaps because they make data-use decisions less efficient. 
95
Facebook has stated that it will not build data storage centres in countries it regards 
as restricting freedom of expression.  
96
 
Requirements to account for the security and privacy of some data underpin 
many data-localisation requirements. According to the OECD, concerns around 
97
privacy, regulation, security, and industrial policy may inform policymakers’ decisions 
to alter international data exchange policy. Around a third of the stipulations force 
98
companies to locally store data and ban them from transferring it abroad, while 
approximately a quarter require companies to hold a copy locally but allow them to 
process it elsewhere.

have also been cited for restricting data flows. Countries such as China, Lebanon, Singapore, Turkey, 
Germany, Iran, and Vietnam ban information exchange on the internet that they deem prejudicial to cultural 
values and public order. See Mitchell D and Hepburn J (2017) ‘Don't Fence Me In: Reforming Trade and

 As countries navigate the data protection approaches they might adopt, there are a number of 
mechanisms available that make data exchange contracts more complete. These include business 
contracts with accepted privacy standards, corporate rules for internal transfers, enforceable corporate 
codes of conduct re transfers, consent given by data sources, and other methods. See Centre for 
Information Policy Leadership (2017) ‘Essential Legislative Approaches for Enabling Cross-Border Data 
Transfers in a Global Economy’, 
 
Open Data Institute 2019What are the links between data infrastructure and trade?  21 

 
 
Restrictions on the commercial use of data have been found to restrict services 
trade. The European Centre for International Political Economy has found that 
100
countries which are more restrictive towards data use and exchange – including 
across borders – see their imports of services become less data-intense; and that 
countries with strong digital networks suffer from bigger effects on their services 
imports. Both effects suggest that stringent data restrictions distance the imposing 
country from international data-exchange networks.  
 
Trust could be as important as any other factor when examining how a 
country’s data infrastructure affects its trade competitiveness. ​Data subjects’ 
trust in the organisations that use data affects data sharing; and it seems reasonable 
to believe that if coordination around data ethics and rules is hard at the national level 
it will be even harder at the international one. There is a large body of support in 
many countries for the domestic storage of personal data – more than 75% of 
surveyed internet users in Indonesia, China, India, Poland and Mexico – suggesting 
that there is a long way to go before the general public are willing to engage in 
cross-border data sharing in a way that would maximise the gains from trade. This 
101
might be unsurprising, given that the web has connected people around the world in 
ways that they never have been before, and there may need to be a period of ‘cultural 
learning’ before such a difficult trade issue can be addressed.  
102
 
Digital Planet 2017, a report on digital competitiveness, argued that some 
countries have established more internal trust in their digital ecosystems than 
others. ​It divided countries by whether users of digital services had trust and 
103
patience with their digital ecosystem, and found that consumers in countries such as 
China, Ireland, and Malaysia were more likely to balance their appreciation of digital 
services with their concerns about data; while those places like Estonia, France, and 
South Korea were less likely to and had less trust in the digital economy as a result. 
The report argued that consumers in the former were more likely to appreciate the 
use of such services and were willing to use them despite having less trust in the use 
of their data and suchlike.  
 
China’s mix of market size and weak institutions challenges the argument that 
trust and standards are a competitive advantage for all countries. ​The Global 
Competitiveness Index ranks China’s the 27th most competitive economy in the 
world, but mostly due to its domestic market, primary public services, and 
macroeconomic stability. In 2015, information and communications technology 
104
services produced 2.6% of value-added in the Chinese economy, but in the same 
year only Hong Kong’s exports of telecommunications services registered among the

world’s most competitive. Despite the growth of Chinese firms such as Huawei and 
105
Lenovo, the European Centre for International Political Economy has argued that 
China is underperforming in the internet economy.  
106
 
Involving social groups, public representatives, and others in the construction of 
data infrastructure can help to reduce cultural, ethical and other indirect 
barriers to trade. ​There are many other actors who can be included in data 
107
infrastructure questions, including data intermediaries who might coordinate data 
exchange between parties and have a role in maintaining legal and technical 
standards; reusers of data, who might be several steps along a data-use chain and 
can affect trust in the use of data all along it; and academic researchers, who might 
be working with the most sensitive types of data, such as health data.  
108
 
Coordination over data standards somewhat mimics international discussion of 
internet governance.​ States, businesses, civil society, intergovernmental 
organisations, technical communities, and academics are involved in determining 
how the internet operates. The World Wide Web Consortium, for example, 
109
develops standards for the web, while the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names 
and Numbers works on identifiers and coordinates naming on the internet.  
110
 
Achieving stable and internationally attractive domestic coordination around 
data ethics could lead to greater trade competitiveness. ​The United Nations 
Conference on Trade and Development has noted the high levels of data protection 
coordination in international agreements, but also the divergent implementation. It 
has recommended that countries adopt principles such as organisations being open 
about their data collection; specifying the purpose of data collection; and allowing 
data subjects to access and correct data about themselves. The Global 
111
Competitiveness Index lists intellectual property protection; corporate ethics; and 
legal system efficiency as some of the leading measures of assessing a country’s 
competitiveness. Perhaps data ethics and associated behaviour could be a future 
addition if measuring it becomes feasible.  
112
 
Several approaches to balancing the security, efficiency, and productivity of 
cross-border data transfers in international agreements have emerged in recent 
years.​ The US International Trade Commission believes that they broadly divide into 
the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) model, the EU’s GDPR, and some 
hybrid or sector-driven approaches. The EU’s approach has been described as one 
113
which uses adequacy requirements for data exchange between jurisdictions, with 
exceptions applied, and has extended the EU’s reach to countries storing data

outside the union. The APEC approach seeks to harmonise members’ data protection 
laws while facilitating cross-border data transfers. The commission considers 
114
countries such as Indonesia and Russia to have taken the EU’s approach; while 
China, India, and the US – which is one of several common-law countries that might 
be thought of as taking an approach that tends towards accountability, due diligence, 
and appropriate protection – address the question by sector rather than 
comprehensively. 
115
 
As suggested by the US International Trade Commission, GDPR has affected 
the sale of data-driven services by foreign producers into EU markets. 
Professional services companies in Canada, for example, offer GDPR-readiness 
assessments and implementation roadmaps. Fines violating GDPR rules can be up to 
€20 million or up to 4% of the annual worldwide turnover of the preceding financial 
year in case of an enterprise, whichever is greater. 
116
 
There are ongoing developments in the data-exchange relationship between the 
EU and the US.​ Model contracts and the EU-US Privacy Shield have been developed 
to facilitate data-enabled trade between the US and the EU, but these may have been 
insufficient to prevent US companies from needing to build cloud storage centres in 
the EU. Safe Harbour was developed because the EU thought the US privacy 
117
regime inadequate. 
118
 
As data regulation regimes develop, improving their interoperability may be 
more efficient than global coordination. ​This would mean that countries would 
119
adopt codes of conduct, mutual recognition of standards, or other agreements that 
clarify issues between countries rather than requiring lots of them to accede to one 
agreement at once. Such an approach would also align with interoperability 
approaches in software development, where developers often aim to make systems 
interoperable rather than create one system for all uses.  
Incentives for trade and investment 
Incentives for data-enabled trade and investment are about how easy it is to 
create value from data, attract capital, and export. ​In recent years it has become 
clear that companies with an entrepreneurial approach to data-enabled goods and 
services have a competitive advantage. A country’s business environment can affect 
the dynamism of firms being established, operated, and closed down as they pursue 
growth at home and abroad. The ease of doing that affects how attractive a country’s 
business climate is to foreign companies who may want to operate a data-enabled 
business in the country.

Public institutions inform the incentives for data-enabled trade, and regulatory 
sandboxes can be a way for them to test ways in which to do so. ​Britain’s 
Financial Conduct Authority created sandboxes for new fintech services in 2016, 
giving companies the chance to sell new products to consumers under six months’ 
close interaction with the financial regulator to gauge and adjust the performance of 
the product within guidelines. Such an approach gives companies an opportunity 
120
to understand how to use and share users’ data, and the UK’s Financial Conduct 
Authority believes that it allows companies to test new market offerings early while 
also facilitating investment. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority established its 
121
Fintech Supervisory Sandbox in 2016. 
122
 
Britain’s Information Commissioner’s Office is extending regulatory sandboxes 
into more data-enabled sectors. ​The commissioner has been keen to find ways 
123
to allow data-enabled innovation that respects regulation while allowing regulators to 
respond to technology developments that it would have been difficult to foresee. 
These include developments in biometrics, the Internet of Things, and wearable 
technology. These may need a mix of regulator advice on rules and standards; the 
regulator adopting frameworks rather than rules, and being ready to remove 
innovation-stifling stipulations; or becoming better at anticipating change.  
 
Assessing the quality of a data ecosystem has been a strong point of data 
infrastructure analysis for a few years. ​The World Bank has sought to understand 
and encourage private sector demand for government data around the world through 
its Open Data for Business Tool. The Govlab has tried to identify organisations that 
might use data to solve problems – after recognising that the public release of data in 
many countries was falling into a habit of creating data portals with little appreciation 
of how the data might be used. There are also applications in the financial sector 
through the Open Banking Index, and for assessing national geospatial capabilities 
with the Geospatial Readiness Index. 
124
 
Many governments have recently made governance a point of institutional 
competitiveness in artificial intelligence. Several countries have artificial 
125
intelligence strategies which cover developing the skills for data manipulation; setting 
technical standards; and coordinating between public research organisations and 
private companies. For example, Japan has developed artificial intelligence utilisation 
principles; Kenya has a task force on distributed ledgers and artificial intelligence; 
and South Korea has published a ‘Master plan for the intelligent information society’.
 
126
 
Australia has put data exploitation at the centre of its Australia 2030 economic 
strategy. It advocates making access to public data more useful for entrepreneurs,

and developing more high-performance computing to allow more research in 
data-heavy activities. In the strategy, Australia has recognised that firms become 
more competitive abroad if they are subject to the pressure of competition at home. It 
reports that domestic competition filters weak market offerings, redistributing 
financial and human capital to firms that are best able to innovate and efficiently meet 
demand. The strategy notes that it is more likely that these firms will have 
sophisticated business models that can survive foreign competition.  
128
 
Australia is using its Consumer Data Right to drive domestic competition in 
data-heavy sectors. ​The right gives consumers access to data about them in 
129
machine-readable form, allowing them to extract it from one service and give it to 
another. This ease of data portability incentivises data holders to improve digital 
services, as customers can easily move to competitor services with better offers. 
Australia has approached the question of data access and competition by giving 
regulatory leadership to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, 
supported by the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner. The right will 
start in highly regulated sectors such as banking, energy, and telecommunications.  
 
Encouraging data portability may improve entry into digital markets and 
improve competition. ​Data portability allows consumers to extract data from one 
holder and give it to another so that they can better direct how data is used. This is 
likely to improve the goods and services provided to them by the selected company.
 GDPR provides a right to data portability that is stronger than the previous right to 
130
data access. Through the Smart Data Review the UK government is exploring 
131
strengthening data portability in multiple sectors. 
132
 
Regulatory sophistication towards data-enabled digital sectors has recently 
become more of a competitive advantage. ​A recent report on digital competition 
133
for the British government recommended that data openness and common standards 
would allow more competition in data-heavy industries, some of which were liable to 
quickly ‘tipping’ and making one company dominant in the market. But such 
interventions are new and untested beyond a few cases, and the report mentioned 
the difficulty of defining a digital market in which a firm might be dominating. 
Competition in digital markets will drive innovation and productivity growth. But 
developing countries face the problem of growing local companies in the face of 
international firms that have established strong market positions – and the ability of 
regulators to develop sophisticated interventions may affect the competitiveness of 
their jurisdictions for years to come.  
134
 
Australia’s Consumer Data Right is starting in the financial sector because open 
banking has become a leading example of the benefits of a good data 
ecosystem. ​The Open Data Institute was part of establishing the UK’s Open Banking 
Working Group in 2015, showing how open application programming interfaces 
between the UK’s banks could ease the transfer of data between them, encouraging

the development of new services. The open banking reforms built on the UK’s 
135
financial sector strengths to attract around $5.6bn of investment in 2018. Versions 
136
of the initiative have spread to Canada, Japan, Mexico, and other countries. 
Factor conditions 
Factor inputs are the resources that firms use to create products and services, 
and the conditions in which they access them affect the costs of production. 
Factor inputs include capital and labour, and in data infrastructure terms means the 
access that firms have to data in given sectors, and its quality. Labour force skills 
drive the extraction of value from the data.  
137
 
Data release by public organisations has long been a way to stimulate data 
flows. ​For example, Australia’s 2015 Public Data Policy Statement provided a 
mandate for Australian Government entities to optimise the use and reuse of public 
data to drive innovation across the economy. The statement included mandating 
138
the release of data as ‘open by default’ when it is safe to do so and since then there 
has been a dramatic increase in the number of datasets publicly available: 
data.gov.au now hosts over 29,900 data records.  
 
Recent figures suggest that there is a surge of finance available for data 
applications that use artificial intelligence. ​The OECD has estimated that there was 
nearly $17bn of equity investment into artificial intelligence across China, the EU, 
Israel, the US, and some other places in 2017. It found that in the same year 
139
around 12% of worldwide private equity investment had gone to artificial intelligence 
startups, up from 3% in 2011.  
140
 
Investment into artificial intelligence startups is a bet on a firm having access to 
data, and having the technical efficiency to exploit it.​ The returns to scale – the 
quantitative change in output resulting from a proportionate increase in inputs – of 
data manipulation allow firms to improve their existing products, such as internet 
search, while also learning about how they might produce new ones and expand into 
further markets. But there is evidence to suggest that some of the world’s largest 
141
firms have been unable to develop useful data exploitation and artificial intelligence 
skills: more than half of the large US firms responding to a recent survey said that 
they were not treating data as an asset, nor using it to compete. This is despite the 
142
fact that ‘data-driven decision making’ has been found to raise firms’ productivity by 
as much as 6%. 
143
 
There is a data feedback loop in artificial intelligence applications, which has 
already had effects on international trade. ​Artificial intelligence improves by using

an initial dataset, using it to carry out a task, and then getting better through learning 
from the results and receiving more data. When consumers have so many products 
144
and services to choose from, using artificial intelligence to more efficiently link them 
with sellers could raise consumer welfare, and some studies have shown that artificial 
intelligence has raised international trade possibilities by as much as 20%.  
145
 
A range of business models for extracting value from data are being tested in 
sectors all over the world. There are internal, supply-chain, and industry 
146
platforms that determine many business models in sectors using large amounts of 
data. But these may be only frontier examples, with the skills and management 
systems available to undertake extensive data manipulation in low supply and firms 
around the world not operating with modern information technology. 
147
 
Allocating data science skills through an efficient labour market could have 
significant effects on how well a country can maximise its data infrastructure 
competitiveness. ​Skills for data manipulation have become some of the most 
remunerative in the modern labour market. In the US job market, they are thought to 
enjoy base salaries that are as much as 36% higher on average than people with 
statistics skills but no coding ability.  
148
 
Despite the emergence of online freelance platforms, geographic 
concentrations of data skills are becoming common.​ It is possible that one of the 
least mobile inputs into the development of data-enabled digital services – labour – is 
concentrated in only a few areas of the world – such as Berlin, Shanghai, and 
Toronto. And this concentration of expert labour could be behind some of the biggest 
advances in sectors such as artificial intelligence. This is perhaps driven by firms 
149
with valuable data being unwilling to share it with more than a few organisations 
around the world; or by the advantages – management efficiency and control of a 
complicated process – gained by having a small number of highly educated people in 
one place.  
 
Several countries have noticed the geographic concentration of data skills and 
are investing heavily in education and the supply of skills for technology 
careers.​ For example, Canada’s Ontario province is spending C$3bn through its 
Innovation Agenda to improve its business climate, labour skills, and ability to 
compete in developing internationally competitive digital services. This is in 
150
addition to its Advanced Manufacturing Supercluster strategy, for which public 
authorities are coordinating skills training and technology adoption to boost 
capabilities in machine learning and associated activities.

There are many schemes around the world for increasing worker skills in a way 
that increase the ability to extract skills from data. ​MexicoFIRST has raised the 
quality of information and communications technology (ICT) skills and increased job 
opportunities. Surveys show that MexicoFIRST trainees credit the training 
programme certification and skills with finding work or for gaining better salaries and 
promotions. Over 100,000 trainees have received international standard certifications; 
over 80,000 university students have attended MexicoFIRST courses; and 40,000 
have found a new job in the IT industry. Digiboost Finland was launched in 2015 and 
aims to increase the use of ICT in small and medium-sized enterprises by employing 
ICT specialists. The programme funds the hiring of one or more digital experts for a 
year who then help firms to use ICT. Since 2015, 220 firms have employed over 250 
digital experts. 
Intermediate inputs and backbone services 
A data-enabled firm’s access to resources and services that it does not have 
in-house affects how easily it can create value from data.​ This tends to mean 
access to information and communications technology and associated infrastructure, 
data science consultancy, and its connections in a vibrant data ecosystem. For 
example, the ICT Development Index looks at factors such as mean years of 
schooling in a population, the number of households with a computer, and the 
number of fixed-broadband subscriptions. Hong Kong was ranked sixth in the world 
in 2017, and its information and communications technology services sector employs 
approximately 108,000 people and contributes 6.6% to its annual GDP.  
152
 
Including more people and organisations in creating data infrastructure can 
help with the supply of digital skills and services. ​They can be:  
 
●public servants that want to know how to better share data for the 
improvement of public services 
●developers that want to establish standards that make it easier to work with 
their peers across the world 
●entrepreneurs that need policymakers to understand that they need access 
to more workers with digital skills 
●firms with promising business models that cannot enter a market because of 
unfair practices from incumbents 
●international freelancers that want to work in a place for a short time before 
moving on.  
153
 
Allowing more of these voices to be heard during the development of data 
infrastructure - especially by policy-makers - can contribute to diversity in the supply 
of services.  
 
Building data infrastructure with many users in mind invites open innovation and 
increases dynamism in the creation of data-enabled goods and services. ​Large 
firms that want to be more innovative can benefit from allowing small firms with 
specialist skills into their research and development processes, and it is easier to do

that if there are more organisations that they can collaborate with. Firms can foster 
154
this openness to innovation by setting up challenge prizes and development 
networks, with corporations building digital tools to bring new ideas in more quickly. 
 
There are ever more examples of how innovation by data management services 
could feed more future innovation.​ There are a range of approaches to increasing 
access to data. Newer approaches being explored include personal data stores. 
155
Mydex, for example, helps digital service users to monitor and control personal data 
about them, while at the same time assisting companies improve their data security 
credentials with their customers. Digi.me operates in a similar way, and is seeking to 
help consumers, companies engage in private data sharing. It is also aiming to 
spread such services to medical records in the UK’s healthcare system. Other 
156
approaches involve new institutions such as data trusts, data clubs and data 
cooperatives. 
157
 
Public–private partnerships for data exchange and use have emerged, such as 
Data 61 is Australia. It is seeking to work across the public sector, academia, and 
158
enterprise, to create a data innovation ecosystem. Data 61 offers consultancy and 
connections on the use of data, research, testing new market offerings, particularly in 
sectors such as smart cities, health and wellness, and machine learning. 
 
Public exchanges and platforms for data use have found a role.​ The Amsterdam 
Data Exchange, for example, is seeking to establish a system of data exchange 
between researchers, businesses, citizens, and government organisations for a 
variety of purposes. DECODE, a project by Nesta, is establishing decentralised and 
159
open-source technical standards for sharing data that could allow them to more 
easily engage with projects that would value data. 
160
 
International development agencies have fostered data institutions, such as the 
Africa Regional Data Cube, to boost data use for anti-poverty aims. ​The 
161
project is using satellites to help Kenya, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Ghana, and Tanzania 
with agriculture, deforestation, and water supply. As it does so, partner governments 
and organisations are being assisted to develop their capacity for collecting, 
analysing, and using data for policy ends, thereby developing their data ecosystems.
  
162
 
Public sector adoption of artificial intelligence may be a part of encouraging 
wider adoption. ​Hong Kong’s Innovation and Technology Fund has supported 57 
artificial and robotics-related projects with over HK$200 million in the past three 
years. The Hong Kong government is also looking to use more artificial intelligence

in public administration, such as city management, transport, and customs 
inspection. 
 
Cities around the world are centres of data innovation, and this size and level of 
innovation is ideal to analyse and identify the services that support data 
exploitation.​ Connected Places Catapult, a British research institute, found that the 
following roles and organisations had helped to foster data innovation in cities in the 
UK: 
 
●City data platforms for sharing data between organisations, such as 
CityVerve Manchester which runs demonstration projects on how the Internet 
of Things can improve the use of data to address urban issues.  
164
●Data catalogues for access to open data such as the Comprehensive 
Knowledge Archive Network, which creates tools for openly publishing and 
analysing datasets.  
165
●Suppliers in the Internet of Things, who in addition to collecting data, offer 
analysis and visualisation services. Examples include Cleanspace, which 
helps urban residents to track pollution in their area.  
166
●Cloud service providers that often host large datasets and can provide data 
analysis and visualisation services, such as Amazon Web Services and 
Microsoft Azure.  
●Data producers who earn revenue through selling access to data, such as 
that for maps. Examples in the include Ordnance Survey, Britain’s national 
mapping service.  
167
●Large technology providers for database services and suchlike. Examples 
include IBM and Cisco. 
●Support organisations who are often doing research while providing 
consultancy, such as universities.  
●Data science providers.  
168
 
Artificial intelligence firms are an example of how business models for data 
exploitation can be affected by the services and data ecosystem available. 
169
Because open or easily accessible data attracts people and organisations to work 
with it, firms can pitch an approach on a spectrum that invites more or less 
collaboration with others working on similar problems.​ ​There could be five stock 
business models that mix judgements about how much a firm should use external 
collaboration opportunities or internal and procured skills in the development of 
artificial intelligence products: 
 
1.Open algorithm and closed data model: with this approach firms restrict 
access to data but give access to their algorithms, using open source toolkits 
to work with interested specialists and allowing others to develop 
complementary services. 
2.Closed algorithm and closed data model: this approach treats data and a 
company’s algorithms as intellectual property, relying on internal resources 
and available services for exploitation.

3.Closed algorithm and open data model: this is also known as the ‘proprietary 
algorithm model’ with which firms give access to data and low access to 
algorithms. This approach tends to be favoured by firms that want to create 
competitive algorithms without having to control a large dataset, as a startup 
might want to.  
4.Open algorithm and open data model: an approach that perhaps allows 
innovation to occur more quickly, but requires a firm to restrict access to its 
skills, hardware, or other assets, if it is to be commercially viable.  
5.Shared algorithm and shared data model: an approach that is favoured by 
consultancies that license access to their artificial intelligence systems.  
 
Physical infrastructure for data-enabled trade affects how well firms can share 
data and reach consumers.​ Data centres play a leading role in international finance 
Data is collected, stored securely and analysed in data centres. Canada’s Digital 
Economy Action Plan is spending over C$100m on digital infrastructure in Quebec, 
but the costs of building data centres across the world can differ substantially and 
affect competitiveness – perhaps varying by as much as $60.9m in Brazil, $51.2m in 
Chile, and $43m in the US. 
170
 
Access to cloud computing is one of the most analysed aspects of data-enabled 
competitiveness. ​Estimates of annual global spending on cloud computing 
171
services run from around $70bn to up to $90bn, with the US accounting for more 
than double the spending in the EU and the rest of the world combined, although 
spending has risen considerably in recent years in countries such as Brazil. There 
172
are essentially two types of product on offer: physical infrastructure for cloud 
computing, and services for access to the infrastructure. Developing countries spend 
more on the former than the latter, and developed countries the reverse.  
173
 
Cloud computing as a service can improve business processes and reduce 
barriers to entry, especially for firms in developing countries. ​Cloud computing 
174
services reduce the information and communications technology costs that firms 
have to bare. They remove the need for company servers and allow entrepreneurs to 
store and manipulate data without having to invest in their own hardware before they 
have proven their business model. Infrastructure service providers benefit from 
175
economies of scale, gaining market share and reducing costs for their customers; 
and in mature markets, companies have been able to use multiple suppliers to build 
bespoke services while reducing the risks from being dependent on one. Large US 
176
cloud computing suppliers have entered large developing country markets, but have 
been challenged in recent years by local competitors.  
177
 
Geography appears to matter more in the provision of cloud computing than 
might be expected. ​The latency in access to software as a service for data-heavy 
activities introduces extra geographic aspects into data-enabled trade 
competitiveness, meaning that some services might be better provided if they are

close to servers. With the introduction of online-only digital services such as 
178
gaming, speed and geography questions may become more pertinent, while 
connectivity demands could mean that servers are best placed in climates in which 
they can be kept cool without high energy costs. There is also some evidence that 
179
cultural and legal familiarity has motivated European companies to choose local 
cloud services suppliers.  
180
 
Cutting the cost of internet and data access and making them available to more 
people domestically, is a competitiveness question. ​A country’s digital skills 
181
base is boosted through more people using the internet from an early age and being 
more prepared for internet-driven processes in the workplace, while the price per 
month for a gigabyte of data to download can vary from around 1% of GDP per 
capita in Mauritius to 45% in Zimbabwe. The Global Competitiveness Index 
182
regards internet access in schools – and by extension access to data – to be an 
‘efficiency enhancer’, meaning that more familiarity with the internet during education 
helps employees to be better managers in the workforce.  
183
 
The nature of data exploitation, and availability of services, skills, and data 
infrastructure could help explain geographic clusters of data competitiveness. 
The agglomeration of skills and other resources for data-enabled sectors in a region 
may have several causes, including the economies of scope that become possible 
once a firm has set up the ability to manipulate and manage data; the difficulty of 
moving data across jurisdictions, as mentioned above; and the benefits of firms 
locating in their largest market. But it is difficult to extrapolate effective industrial 
184
policies from these observations.  
 
China’s Greater Bay Area is an example of a data and technology cluster. ​The 
185
area includes Hong Kong, Macau and nine other cities in China’s Guangdong 
province, has 67 million people, and creates 12% of China’s GDP. The Chinese 
government has a vision for the region to rival Silicon Valley in the US and Tokyo Bay 
in Japan, and to help achieve it, respective public authorities have made interventions 
such as establishing research centres – specialising in healthcare technologies, 
artificial intelligence and robotics technologies – at the Hong Kong Science Park.  
186
 
Trade promotion 
Export promotion is about attracting foreign consumers, and investment 
promotion is about attracting foreign investors. ​There are few examples of 
countries using their data infrastructure credentials to promote themselves, but many

of the elements that go with it – such as digital skills – are at the centre of strategies 
for attracting investors to dynamic, digital sectors. Export promotion for data-enabled 
goods and services tends to focus on digital services.  
 
The EU made a move for data-enabled trade competitiveness in 1996 with its 
Database Directive. The directive was partly about creating data rights for data 
187
collectors, in an attempt to incentivise European firms to create valuable databases 
that would make them more internationally competitive. 
 
Access to data is being used by some countries as an incentive for foreign 
investment.​ For example, Singapore has increased access to government datasets 
for location and transportation; while Hong Kong’s data portal has become a 
forerunner to the Hong Kong Hospital Authority establishing a data analytics platform 
for biotechnological research. Canada’s open government drive is identifying 
188
high-value datasets, and spreading adoption of the Open Data Charter, while the 
country’s Open Data 150 – a project that maps Canadian companies that use open 
data – allows potential open data users to see what applications are possible.  
189
 
Objectives for digitisation and more data use are some of the highest economic 
priorities for OECD countries. In 2017 the OECD found that within the digital 
190
strategies of its member countries: 22 had objectives for developing their 
telecommunications infrastructure; 16 had objectives for promoting information 
technology skills; and 16 had objectives to generate more science and innovation.  
191
Countries such as Australia, Brazil, and Germany have been racing in recent years to 
write artificial intelligence strategies and data protection frameworks that they hope 
will push them ahead in developing and selling advanced technology abroad in 
sectors such as automobiles, finance, and satellites.  
 
If data standards become an aspect of trade competitiveness, subsidies for 
certification could be an export support policy. ​Helping producers in one country 
achieve the quality standards of another has long been an intervention favoured by 
policymakers – particularly in developing countries – for raising the amount of value 
that firms can gain from their exports. Guidance on data standards set by the 
192
International Organization for Standardization include ISO 8000 on data quality. 
193
Traditional interventions for helping firms to achieve such standards in the production 
of goods, have included establishing national quality certification centres, facilitating 
integration with international systems, and increasing demand for certification.

mechanism. It directs collaboration between the respective governments, financial 
regulators and industry; and encourages fintech firms to use the facilities and 
assistance available in the other jurisdictions to explore new business opportunities 
and reduce barriers to entry. The bridge also serves as an intervention by the

respective governments for focusing financial services on either country, and firms 
with export potential have access to one-stop shops giving for legal, regulatory and 
practical advice.  
 
Associations for sector coordination have become some of the most common 
examples of data-driven industries, and affect export competitiveness. ​Several 
countries have installed organisations for the development and coordination of 
artificial intelligence research and commercialisation. For example, Canada has

Conclusion 
Data offers considerable innovation possibilities, but analysis of what 
determines a country’s data-enabled trade competitiveness has only just begun. 
Data is unlike other resources and can be reused without depletion while often 
holding delicate information about people – driving the development of new 
technology such as artificial intelligence. But data as a resource also poses novel 
policymaking questions about the rules, institutions, and understanding necessary for 
its full economic exploitation. How countries answer those questions could affect 
their ability to create valuable goods and services, sell them abroad, and grow, for 
decades to come.  
 
Blending classic trade competitiveness analysis with the concept of data 
infrastructure offers guidance to policymakers on the choices they face. ​The 
discussion here has suggested that delineating issues of data infrastructure – using 
the World Bank’s Trade Competitiveness Toolkit framework – outlines the policy 
choices that affect the ability of firms to create new and better digital services with 
data and sell them to consumers in foreign markets. Years of research on digital 
competitiveness offers a foundation for how to consider such questions, but data 
infrastructure raises new issues with regard to data ethics, security of contract, and 
technological standards for data exchange.  
 
Becoming competitive in data-enabled trade may be a question of how to 
develop openness and data sharing in a cautious manner. ​Surveys from countries 
around the world suggest public hesitation towards cross-border data exchange. And 
the nature of collection of – often personal – data through mobile technology brings 
ever more people and organisations into the discussion of which datasets should be 
shared and with whom. Some countries are approaching questions of data innovation 
by using regulatory sandboxes and reconsidering their competition frameworks. 
 
International coordination of data exchange is nascent, and many countries are 
faced with some strategic choices over which framework they adopt. ​GDPR has 
become the most prominent example of international data collection and use 
regulations, and its approach has naturally been adopted by EU countries while 
spreading to others in the union’s neighbourhood. But GDPR strikes a balance 
between policymakers’ competing objectives of efficient cross-border data exchange 
and protection of personal data, that the US and jurisdictions within APEC are 
approaching differently. Dealing with the classic international trade problem of 
incomplete contracts in a world of enormous quantities of data is a relatively young 
topic.  
 
Mistrust and the attraction of defending domestic firms from international 
competition may be driving data use from openness and towards protectionism. 
The discussion here has relayed research on the rising number of countries that are 
requiring firms to store or use the data they collect in the country in which it was 
collected. This may be due to contracts for international data exchange being 
inadequate for the nature of data and its mix of personal and non-personal 
information.ut the consequence is that it limits the range of information that countries 
can exchange – and may limit the ability of firms in restrictive countries to extract 
value from the data they have access to.

Geography matters in the trade of data-enabled goods and services. ​The further 
a cloud storage server is away from using the data in it, the slower the speed with 
which it can be accessed, giving a competitive advantage to countries that host 
servers with large amounts of data.  
 
Not being like China may be a long-run advantage for many countries. ​China has 
generated large amounts of data on its citizens, allowing its firms to create digital 
services that have made them some of the most valuable companies in the world. But 
that is without China having developed the means for its companies to sell large 
amounts of digital services abroad. It would be understandable for policymakers to 
want to emulate China’s success, but that may be difficult without China’s domestic 
market size. Establishing an international reputation for high data standards may be a 
more competitive approach for many countries.  
 
The field of data-enabled trade competitiveness study will grow in the coming 
years to answer some of the questions that this report has raised. ​A research 
agenda could answer pressing questions such as: whether data flows between 
countries show anything about their export performance; how data exchange options 
between countries might be formalised in trade agreements and how these might 
affect their ability to export data-enabled products; how competition policy towards 
digital firms might affect a country’s ability to produce competitive firms in markets 
dominated by existing ones; and whether trade promotion activities could help some 
places to attract investment because of their data ethics standards. The Open Data 
Institute will be analysing some of these issues in future work.
