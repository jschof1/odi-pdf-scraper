Executive summary 
Peer-to-peer accommodation platforms enable people to make their home or spare 
room available for others to rent, normally for a short period of time. 
 
The global market for peer-to-peer accommodation has grown significantly in recent 
years and is expected to be worth as much as £250bn by 2025.  
 
In addition to this growth there is debate around the wider impacts of peer-to-peer 
accommodation. For example, residents of some cities are concerned that it changes 
the way people feel about their homes and communities. There is a risk that this debate 
– and subsequent decisions and actions made by policymakers and other stakeholders 
– will be based on assumptions rather than evidence and opinions informed by data. 
 
The Open Data Institute (ODI) has undertaken a project to understand how data can 
improve the peer-to-peer accommodation market to support businesses, consumers 
and communities. As part of this work, we have conducted interviews and desk research 
to better understand the stakeholders interested in the impact of peer-to-peer 
accommodation and the impacts they focus on, the role of data in understanding impact 
and the potential use of a data observatory. 
 
We have made a number of findings, including that there is a diverse set of stakeholders 
interested in the impacts of peer-to-peer accommodation for different purposes. We also 
found that although peer-to-peer accommodation platforms hold vast amounts of data 
that could be used to understand the market’s impacts, restricted access to this data 
inhibits its use. We also found that data observatories could help to meet the demand for 
more data and increase understanding of the impacts of peer-to-peer accommodation. 
 
 
Based on the findings of our research, we recommend that: 
 
1.public and private sector organisations that hold data should commit to 
working together to build data infrastructure that is as open as possible 
while respecting privacy and commercial confidentiality 
2.national government officials should facilitate and support the creation of 
open data infrastructure in the peer-to-peer accommodation market and 
the development of data observatories 
3.local government officials should create environments that can support the 
development of data observatories 
4.stakeholders with similar needs should develop data observatories 
collaboratively 
5.local and national government officials should engage with different 
stakeholders to inform decision-making related to the impacts of 
peer-to-peer accommodation 
 
Taking these actions will help to improve the collective understanding of the impact of 
the peer-to-peer accommodation market.

1. Introduction 
Across a variety of sectors, platforms that enable people to exchange goods and 
services are challenging traditional business models. 
 
In finance, for example, the global peer-to-peer lending market grew by 271 per cent 
to more than $130bn (£106.4bn) in 2016. Peer-to-peer car sharing aims to provide 
1
an alternative to traditional vehicle ownership; market leader Drivey now has 1.5 million 
users globally. These types of platforms and the activity or exchanges they facilitate 
2
are often referred to collectively as the sharing or collaborative economy. 
 
Peer-to-peer accommodation plays a significant role in this economy, and can be 
broadly defined as accommodation – such as a spare room or an entire home – made 
available by an existing homeowner for others to rent, normally for a short period of time. 
 
Peer-to-peer accommodation platforms such as Airbnb, LoveHomeSwap and Wimdu 
have grown rapidly in recent years. Platforms like these connect homeowners with 
people looking for short-term accommodation, and compete with hotels and other 
more established providers of short-term lettings. 
 
The rapid growth of peer-to-peer accommodation has created opportunities. It is now 
cheaper and easier for people to stay in many countries and cities. More people can 
generate income by providing access to their spare rooms or properties. In the UK, 
Airbnb has estimated that its guests and hosts have generated £3.46bn between July 
2016 and July 2017. Studies have predicted that by 2025, the value of the peer-to-peer 
3
sector could be as high as £250bn worldwide. 
4
 
There is ongoing debate surrounding the impacts of peer-to-peer accommodation and 
the growth of the sharing economy more broadly. In addition to the clear opportunities 
driven by the trend, some have voiced concerns about the negative outcomes it may 
also fuel. 
 
There is a risk that this debate will be based on assumptions rather than informed by 
evidence and data. The best available evidence and data should be used to help 
understand the impacts, so that we can collectively make informed decisions and take 
appropriate action – such as how to encourage positive impacts or when to intervene 
to mitigate negative ones. 
 
As part of the Open Data Institute’s (ODI) data innovation programme, we have 
5
undertaken a project to understand how data can improve the peer-to-peer 
accommodation market to support businesses, consumers and communities.

During a discovery phase that ran between September and December 2017, attempts 
6
to understand the impact of peer-to-peer accommodation stood out as a prominent 
topic. The term “data observatory” was used in stakeholder interviews and workshops to 
describe how data from different sources could be gathered and used to inform the 
debate about this impact. 
 
 
This report summarises the next stage of research we undertook to 
address these questions: 
 
●Who is interested in the impacts of peer-to-peer accommodation and 
what types of impact are they interested in? 
 
●How is data currently used to understand the impacts of peer-to-peer 
accommodation? 
 
●What is a data observatory and how might it support people to better 
understand the impacts of peer-to-peer accommodation? 
 
 
 
Our research consisted of structured interviews with a broad range of stakeholders, 
supported by desk research. The findings of our research are described throughout 
Sections 2, 3 and 4 of this report, and are summarised in Section 5. The final section 
also includes a set of recommendations designed to increase the understanding of the 
impacts of peer-to-peer accommodation.

2. Stakeholders and the 
impacts of peer-to-peer 
accommodation they focus on 
During the project’s discovery phase, we undertook user research to identify a broad 
range of stakeholders interested in understanding different impacts of peer-to-peer 
accommodation. 
7
 
In the next phase of our work we conducted a series of interviews with these 
stakeholders and other individuals and organisations. In total we conducted 15 
interviews, asking interviewees a series of questions about the types of impacts of 
peer-to-peer accommodation they are attempting to understand. 
 
The core set of stakeholders attempting to understand the impacts of peer-to-peer 
accommodation to help them make decisions in line with their organisation's objectives are:  
 
1.Local government officials developing local strategies for planning, economic 
growth and community development, and administering local housing, planning 
and licensing systems 
2.National government officials across different departments or agencies, 
including policymakers focused on housing, tourism and the digital economy, 
and tax collection, as well national tourism agencies and bodies 
3.Politicians representing the views of their constituents and parties on local 
issues, as well as those acting and making decisions at a national level 
4.Statistical organisations such as the UK’s Office for National Statistics (ONS) 
and commercial market researchers 
5.Academic and research institutions and other centres of research 
6.Independent researchers with no particular organisational affiliation 
7.Think-tanks and policy organisations that undertake research and 
advocacy work 
8.Peer-to-peer accommodation platforms and the associations and other 
organisations that represent them 
9.Hotels and alternative providers of short-term accommodation and the 
associations and other organisations that represent them 
10.Emergency services, including police, fire and rescue, and medical services 
11.Home and contents insurance providers, including those developing products 
for the peer-to-peer accommodation market 
12.Hosts who make their properties available using peer-to-peer accommodation 
platforms, ranging from home-owners making a room available sporadically 
through to “commercial hosts” 
13.Guests who use peer-to-peer accommodation 
14.Residents, as well as the associations and other organisations that 
represent them 
15.Property developers and investors, as well as related advisors and agents

We found that these stakeholders are interested in understanding numerous 
types of impacts, described in Table 1 below: 
 
 
Impact type Description 
On the availability of 
long-term housing 
stock 
The numbers of residential properties available to purchase or rent on a 
long-term basis. This can include comparative impacts on different types of 
property such as houses and apartments, or by value. 
On property prices The price of residential property available to purchase. 
On property rental 
prices 
The price of residential property available to rent on a long-term basis, often 
defined as for six months or more. 
On tourism and visitors The numbers of tourists or short-term visitors. This can include impacts on 
lengths of stays, expenditure and types/characteristics of visitors. 
On alternative forms of 
short-term 
accommodation 
The performance of hotels and other forms of short-term accommodation. 
This can include impacts on occupancy rates, profitability and employment. 
On host income The income generated by hosts who make their properties available to 
guests on a short-term basis. 
On economic 
performance 
The contribution to economic performance, often using indicators such as 
Gross Domestic Product (GDP). This can include impacts at local, national 
and sectoral levels. 
On fire, health and 
safety, and other 
incidents 
The prevalence and risks of fire, health and safety, and other incidents, 
including impacts on adherence to existing regulations and rules. 
On noise levels, 
disturbance and 
antisocial behaviour 
The incidence of noise, disturbance and antisocial behaviour. 
On emergency 
services 
The use of and demand for emergency services such as the police, fire and 
rescue, and medical services. 
On other public 
services 
The use of and demand for public services such as transport, refuse and 
recycling, parks and non-emergency medical services. 
On the desirability of 
an area 
The perceived attractiveness of an area to visit or move into. This includes 
impacts on existing residents and visitors, as well as potential ones. 
On the sense of 
community in an area 
The sense of community felt by residents and visitors. This can include 
impacts on the way people feel about their homes, neighbours, businesses 
and community. 
On the environment The consequences to the environment, such as impacts on energy 
consumption, water usage, waste and use of transport. 
On tax revenues The taxation of activity by peer-to-peer accommodation platforms, as well 
as by guests and hosts (such as personal income tax and business rates). 
 
Table 1: Types of impacts of peer-to-peer accommodation 
 
 
 
 
 
Open Data Institute 2018 / ReportImpacts of peer-to-peer accommodation, the role of data and data observatories    6 

 
We have mapped each of the impact types to the stakeholders whom we found 
to have an interest in them in Figure 1 below: 
 
 
 
Figure 1: Types of impacts of peer-to-peer accommodation and the stakeholders who 
are interested in them 
 
 
 
These impacts types are presented neutrally. Whether an impact is considered positive 
or negative, or even non-existent, may depend on the stakeholder and their goals. 
 
Many of these impact types are linked. For example, impacts on the availability 
of housing stock are likely to affect property prices. Similarly, the levels of noise, 
disturbance and antisocial behaviour may affect the desirability of an area or its sense 
of community. There may be a host of complex interactions that link multiple types of 
impact. The different types of impacts may also be grouped into broader topics or 
 
Open Data Institute 2018 / ReportImpacts of peer-to-peer accommodation, the role of data and data observatories    7 

 
domains: a group of national government officials with the remit of tourism policy may be 
interested in the impact of peer-to-peer accommodation on levels of tourism and visitors, 
on economic performance, and on alternative types of short-term accommodation. 
 
Although different stakeholders have an interest in understanding the same types of 
impact of peer-to-peer accommodation, we found that their motivations are likely to 
differ. A national government official may be interested in an impact in their role as 
stewards or regulators of the market; a platform will be interested as a market 
8
participant. The process of developing an understanding of the impacts of peer-to-peer 
accommodation and then acting on that understanding – for instance how it may be 
used to inform a planning or licensing decision made by a local government official – 
is not the focus of this report but is referenced at times in the following sections. 
Stakeholders are also interested in the impacts of peer-to-peer accommodation at 
different geographic and administrative levels. For example, a local government official 
responsible for planning decisions is likely to be interested in more local impacts than 
a national government official concerned with tourism across a country. Some are 
interested at impacts at local, national and international scales. 
 
The type of impacts described in Table 1 are likely to evolve and change over time. 
Many of the interviewees we spoke to described the difficulty of identifying what types 
of impacts to measure or attempt to understand related to peer-to-peer 
accommodation, as well as the sharing or collaborative economy more broadly. 
This difficulty was generally attributed to the speed at which the peer-to-peer 
accommodation market has grown and its differences to traditional forms of short-term 
accommodation. Despite these challenges, almost all stakeholders stated a desire to 
increase their understanding of the impacts of peer-to-peer accommodation.

 As part of this project’s discovery phase, we published a report exploring the different 
types of interventions local and national authorities have made to support the 
peer-to-peer accommodation market:

accommodation sector’,

3. The role of data in 
understanding the impact of 
peer-to-peer accommodation 
Our interviews and desk research found that there are different ways in which data is 
already being used to describe, provide evidence of and understand the impacts of 
peer-to-peer accommodation. 
3.1 Airbnb data 
Almost all information made available by peer-to-peer accommodation platforms 
describing their impact is published by Airbnb. This is, in part, likely due to its dominant 
share of the market (although it is difficult to find accurate figures describing its market 
share) and subsequently, the perceived scale of its impact. 
 
Airbnb publishes summaries, reports and other documentation that include references 
to its impact. For example, it published its UK Insights Report “A look at the impact of 
home sharing across the UK” in 2017. The report includes statistics related to hosts 
9
and listings, and guests and their economic activity at national and regional levels. 
Whilst some statistics in the report are clearly derived from data already held by the 
platform – such as data about its listings – the data and analysis used to generate 
others, like estimates of economic activity and contribution, is unclear. 
  
Airbnb also produces reports that describe its impact in response to particular 
developments. It recently responded to a call for evidence by the Scottish Expert 
Advisory Panel on the Collaborative Economy with a position paper entitled 
10
“The collaborative economy and tourism in Scotland”. Airbnb intended the report 
11
to “contribute to more informed recommendations” and included statistics based 
on data from its UK Insights Report as well as original analysis. Further statistics 
and figures related to the impact of its guests’ and hosts’ activities are also included 
in regulatory proposals Airbnb makes to local governments. For example, in a series of 
proposals made to the city of Edinburgh in January 2018, it described how “local families 
typically earned £3,600 per year by hosting guests from all over the world for around 38 
nights of the year”.  
12
 
In addition to reports, Airbnb has made some limited data available on the Airbnb Citizen 
website that describes its impact on particular cities. These overviews – for example, of

the Airbnb community in Berlin – are restricted to a small number of cities on a yearly 
13
basis and were last updated for 2015. 
14
 
Airbnb also shares data on an ad hoc basis with other organisations for research 
purposes, for example, to support a 2016 study into home sharing in London by 
the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR) and research into the supply of 
15
accommodation during the 2016 Olympics in Rio. 
16
3.2 Third-party data intermediaries 
In recent years, third-party data intermediaries such as AirDNA and Inside Airbnb 
1718
have become popular providers of data related to the impact of peer-to-peer 
accommodation. 
 
Data infrastructure consists of data assets, the organisations that operate and maintain 
19
them, and guides and policies describing how to use and manage the data. Third-party 
intermediaries form an important part of the data infrastructure that is used to help 
understand the impacts of peer-to-peer accommodation. The ODI has recently used 
ecosystem mapping to understand the data, organisations and relationships that 
comprise data infrastructure, and also the organisations and communities that use and 
benefit from it. 
20
 
AirDNA says that it currently tracks around four million global Airbnb listings by scraping 
publicly available data about hosts and listings from the Airbnb website. It provides a 
number of services to users, most of which it charges for. These include an interactive 
map-based tool that presents information about individual Airbnb listings, reports on 
broader trends and raw data for further analysis. The types of information it generates 
include occupancy rates, average daily charges and property revenues. These services 
appear to be focused predominantly on supplying hosts and property investors with 
information on trends in the supply and demand for accommodation, and insights to 
support the pricing of accommodation. 
21
 
Inside Airbnb also provides access to data and a set of analytical tools that enable users 
to explore Airbnb activity in cities around the world. ​Inside Airbnb is similar to AirDNA in 
that it uses data ​about individual listings ​scraped from the Airbnb platform​, although it 
appears to serve a different, less-commercial set of use cases. It says that it can be used 
to produce data in response to broad queries like “How many listings are in my 
neighbourhood and where are they?”, as well as more targeted ones such as “Show me 
all the highly available listings in Bedford-Stuyvesant in Brooklyn, New York City, which

are for the ‘entire home or apartment’ that have a review in the last six months AND 
booked frequently AND where the host has other listings.” 
22
 
Different types of organisations – including public authorities and academic institutions – 
use data sourced from AirDNA and Inside Airbnb to analyse the impact of Airbnb activity. 
For example, recent studies by the School of Urban Planning at the McGill University on 
impacts in New York City and Alasdair Rae’s analysis of short-term lets in Edinburgh 
2324
rely on data from AirDNA data and Inside Airbnb respectively. Studies into the impact 
of​ ​peer-to-peer accommodation often combine data from these intermediaries with data 
from other sources, such as demographic data published by local public authorities. 
Some studies are then reported in popular media. For example, an article published by 
Wired​ in January 2018 referenced a number of studies and analyses, all of which were 
25
conducted using data, in part, from the two intermediaries. 
 
Airbnb generally disputes the accuracy of data scraped by AirDNA and Inside Airbnb, 
and by extension, the outputs produced using data provided by them. This inaccuracy 
is​ ​often ascribed to the models used to infer listing occupancy and profitability. Also, as 
acknowledged in the City of San Francisco's analysis of the short-term rental market, 
26
data related to other peer-to-peer accommodation platforms is not made available, 
either directly by platforms or via third-party intermediaries. As a result, most analysis 
focuses on Airbnb’s activities only, which may distort their conclusions about the 
impacts of peer-to-peer accommodation, particularly for areas where other platforms are 
commonly​ ​used. 
 
Airbnb’s Terms of Service prohibit “use [of] any robots, spider, crawler, scraper or 
other​ ​automated means or processes to access, collect data or other content from 
or​ ​otherwise interact with the Airbnb Platform for any purpose”. AirDNA’s and Inside 
27
Airbnb’s legal basis for scraping and using data from Airbnb, and making it available 
to​ ​other users, is therefore unclear and questions the sustainability and legality of any 
applications, services or analyses that use this data. For example, Inside Airbnb asserts 
that the data it publishes is in the public domain, by publishing it under a CC0 waiver; 
it​ ​is unlikely, however, that it has the rights to do that unless it has a separate agreement 
with Airbnb. 
 
There does not appear to be public debate about privacy issues related to the ways 
in which data scraped from Airbnb is used. For example, although available listings 
are displayed publicly to potential guests, the process of scraping data describing 
an individual property or room and using it outside of its original purpose – such as by 
enabling users to analyse patterns over time or to download and combine it with other 
datasets – may increase the risk that individual hosts could be identified. Currently, many 
decisions related to privacy sit with third-party intermediaries who scrape listing data –

Inside Airbnb states that the data it makes available for download “has been analysed, 
cleansed and aggregated where appropriate to facilitate public discussion”.  
28
 
Who can access data is the characteristic that most affects how it can be used to 
support decision-making or drive innovation. Data exists on a spectrum of closed, 
29
shared or open, as shown below in Figure 2. 
 
 
Figure 2: The Data Spectrum 
 
Some of the types of data used to understand the impacts of peer-to-peer 
accommodation are made available as open data that anyone can access, use and 
share. This is mainly limited to data held by the public sector (described in Section 3.4), 
such as demographic characteristics of different areas and the outputs of business 
surveys. This data can be used without restriction in various studies and analyses. 
 
Other data types exist within the shared part of the spectrum; this includes the data 
Airbnb sometimes shares with organisations for research purposes. The choice made by 
Airbnb and other peer-to-peer accommodation platforms not to publish, or share more 
widely, data that they hold has led to third-party intermediaries like AirDNA and Inside 
Airbnb scraping data from their websites. These intermediaries then make their own 
decisions about how users can access the data, such as by restricting it to users who 
pay for premium services or publishing it under certain licences. 
 
 
The data relationship between private sector organisations and the 
places where they operate: examples from the transport sector  
 
There is a wider debate about the ways that private sector organisations should 
make data generated by their products and services available to the towns, cities 
and other places in which they operate. This debate is perhaps strongest around 
operators in the transport sector who collect data about, and are thought to 
impact, public infrastructure at a significant scale.

Data collected by private sector transport providers could inform cities’ decisions 
about their own public transport services, investment in physical infrastructure 
and much more. In response to demand for data it holds, Uber has developed 
Movement, an interactive mapping tool which aggregates data collected about its 
users’ journeys and makes it available to help people understand traffic flows and 
patterns around cities. Similarly to Airbnb, it also shares data with some 
researchers. Uber’s Head of Transportation Policy and Research, 
Andrew Salzberg, has recently said that the company is also “actively looking in 
a bunch of different directions to be able to share data in different ways and for 
different purposes”. 
30
 
More than 100 transport planning departments around the world use Strava 
Metro data, collected from app users tracking their running and cycling 
31
activities. The data describes aggregated cyclist and pedestrian activity such as 
popular or avoided routes, peak commute times and origin/destination zones. 
Strava Metro charges cities for access to data it holds. The cost varies based on 
the amount of Strava activity taking place; it was reported in 2014 that one 
year’s-worth of data on cyclists in the city of Portland cost Oregon’s department 
of transportation $20,000. Strava states that it provides access to this data “to 
32
help improve infrastructure and safety for cyclists, runners and pedestrians”. 
33
 
Paid data-sharing agreements and proprietary tools may not satisfy the demands 
that all cities have for data. In 2017 New York’s Taxi and Limousine Commission 
introduced rules requiring rideshare and livery companies, including Uber and Lyft, 
to share detailed data about their passengers’ journeys on a regular basis. 
34
UK government and local authorities have legislated bus operators to open up 
data after other attempts to persuade them to do so failed. A recent London 
35
Assembly Transport Committee report suggested that Transport for London (TfL) 
– which publishes open data that more than 13,000 developers now use to fuel 
their products and services – should expect “reciprocity”, where organisations 
36
who operate in London should be required to share data back to the city. 
 
More cities are likely to consider making legislatory interventions to increase their 
access to data in the transport sector and beyond. For private operators, this is 
not the only reason that attempts to sell data to local and national authorities may 
not be sustainable. Users of products and services are gaining more control over 
data collected by private sector organisations, including through legislation like 
the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). They may prefer that data they 
contribute or is generated about them is made available to cities to help improve 
the infrastructure they use, rather than being monetised. Also, data that can be 
used for similar purposes may be collected by a number of other organisations,

products and services and so may not have unique value. In transport, Google, 
Apple and telecoms operators are likely to hold similar data to the transport 
providers about passenger trips. 
37
 
Rather than defer choices related to data access to legislation, private sector 
organisations could work collaboratively with cities to make the data they hold 
as open as possible while respecting privacy and commercial confidentiality. 
In the context of bike-sharing operators, Peter Wells has suggested that “if the 
bike sharing companies don’t decide to be smart then I suspect the genuinely 
‘smart cities’ will make the decision for them. Bike sharing companies will be 
welcomed, but only the companies that decide to provide better services by 
opening up their data. Smart companies will learn the lessons and get ahead 
of that particular game.” 
38
 
Uses of data held by private sector organisations will extend far beyond those of 
the cities they operate in. Regulators, citizens and other individuals may want to 
use it to get involved in debates around policy. It could also support new products 
and services. By making data as open as possible, private sector organisations 
can support decision-making and drive innovation. Citymapper began publishing 
open data in 2017 about its Smartbus routes, stop locations, schedules and 
real-time arrival predictions. CityMapper was built using open data and the 
organisation sees the value of releasing their own – it “encourage[s] all transport 
operators to make their data freely available to enable innovation 
and accessibility”.  
39
 
In some cases, there will be valid reasons why the data that cities require access 
to cannot be made available as open data – for example, the risk of 
re-identification of individual people whose journeys are described in the data. 
There is an ongoing challenge to find the level of aggregation and access that 
enables data to be as open as possible while protecting privacy and 
commercial confidentiality. 
 
As in other sectors, making valuable data more widely available will be central 
to efforts to understand the impacts of peer-to-peer accommodation. As the 
Scottish Expert Advisory Panel on the Collaborative Economy has recently 
reported, “it is crucial that third party analysts focus on collaborating with 
platforms to access data at source, rather than relying on 
data-scraped information”.

3.4 Other data sources 
As already described, the basis for many studies and analyses of the impact of 
peer-to-peer accommodation is the combination of data scraped from Airbnb with data 
from other sources. 
 
Outside of AirDNA or Inside Airbnb, data is often sourced from business and consumer 
surveys related to the tourism and leisure industry. National tourism agencies and bodies 
such as VisitEngland and VisitBritain publish outputs from national surveys measuring 
the volume, value and characteristics of tourism, and other research. STR provides 
4142
access to data (as well as reports and other documentation) on hotel performance 
for benchmarking, analytics and other insights. Its users include hotel owners and 
operators, investors, and researchers – STR data was used in Diane Coyle’s and 
Timothy Yu-Cheong’s study into the impacts of Airbnb in 14 European cities. 
43
Studies such as “Impacts of peer-to-peer accommodation use on travel patterns” 
44
adopt their own survey methodology to capture new data about the impacts of 
peer-to-peer accommodation. 
 
Local and national governments are increasingly using surveys to capture data related 
to the sharing or collaborative economy, including in the peer-to-peer accommodation 
market. In the UK, the ONS has has developed a framework to support the collection 
and dissemination of statistics on sharing economy activity – related to both individuals 
and businesses – as part of its work to assess the feasibility of “measuring the sharing 
economy”. The ONS is also adapting or introducing new questions into some of its 
45
long-running surveys, such as those focused on GDP and inflation. 
46
 
Although our research unearthed other datasets that can be used to help understand 
the impacts of peer-to-peer accommodation, such as statistics related to property rental 
prices in an area, it was often difficult to identify definitive sources. Those we did identify 
were not always publically available, therefore limiting their use. In many cases, data that 
can be used exists at different levels of geographic and administrative scope, which can 
make it hard to combine or make comparisons. 
 
Informal descriptions of the impacts of peer-to-peer accommodation are referenced in 
political discussions and debates around the world. In a November 2017 debate in the 
Scottish Parliament, for example, numerous constituent testimonies were directly quoted 
and “a very large number” of others were referenced. The impacts these testimonies

describe – such as a report from an individual resident about the impact of peer-to-peer 
accommodation on their sense of community – have a more personal focus than the 
types of studies and analyses that rely on broader statistics. While seldom 
representative, these stories can make abstract numbers more tangible, engaging and 
useful. Access to both statistics and localised data may be needed to understand the 
impacts of peer-to-peer accommodation. In these political discussions and debates, 
a number of similar testimonies are sometimes used as evidence of wider trends, 
or of types or severity of impact. 
 
Data describing the impacts of peer-to-peer accommodation can also be generated by 
cooperation between platforms and local public authorities. Our discovery research 
48
found that some types of cooperation require property location and host identity data to 
be provided to local authorities as part of a property registration process. Similarly, the 
49
Mayor of London’s draft housing strategy states that the city will work with short-term 
letting operators to develop an information-sharing protocol to support councils’ 
enforcement of the city’s 90-day rule. However, as data is not the focus of these types 
50
of cooperation, it is unclear whether the data they generate is also used to understand 
the impact of peer-to-peer accommodation. 
  
48
 This cooperation is sometimes mandated via interventions made by local or national 
authorities, such as the introduction of regulation or other rules, and at other times is 
developed in collaboration between industry and authorities, or proposed by 
peer-to-peer accommodation platforms.

4. Data observatories 
The term “data observatory” was used frequently in the original discovery interviews and 
workshops we ran. It was used by different stakeholders to describe the possibility of 
bringing together data to enable people to better understand the impacts of 
peer-to-peer accommodation. As a result, we conducted further research into how the 
term is used in other sectors and contexts. 
4.1 In the wild 
We found a number of relevant examples of data observatories. The general concept 
appears linked to local information systems, or geographic information systems (GIS). 
These systems enable users to “load, store, analyse and present statistical data that has 
a strong geographic reference”, to provide “a place-focused evidence base that is easily 
accessible to a wide range of users including data experts, managers, policy makers, 
front-line staff and citizens”. 
51
 
Many modern data portals have similar functionality to these types of systems. A basic 
definition of a data portal is “a list of datasets with pointers to how those datasets can 
be accessed”, helping users to discover data. Their inclusion of features such as data 
52
analysis and visualisation tools means that the distinction between a data portal, a local 
information or GIS system, and a data observatory is not always clear. 
 
We have attempted to group the examples of data observatories we found: 
 
●Data observatories as policymaking tools​. A number of tools developed 
with the purpose of supporting policymaking share the characteristics and 
functions of other identified types of data observatories. Recent work by the 
Department for Work and Pensions on the Churchill tool was driven by the 
finding that policymakers rely on a combination of official government statistics 
and data about local communities. The Churchill tool provides access to data 
53
from across government on-demand, and provides policymakers with tools to 
explore topics in more detail, and changes and trends over time. The Local 
Government Inform (LG Inform) tool enables councils to access over 1,800 
54
types of data to assess performance locally, regionally and nationally, and help 
them to make decisions about their local areas and services. The iCOASST 
project provides real-time data, interactive maps, GIS tools and reports to 
55
support shoreline management and other long-term coastal decision-making. 
 
●Data observatories as collections of data held by the public sector​. We 
found numerous local data observatories, such as those covering East Riding

and North Lincolnshire, which consist of collections of maps, statistics, facts, 
57
figures and data. Generally, these data observatories cover a broad range of 
topics including demography, housing and the economy based on data from 
sources such as local fire, police and health services. Data portals like the 
London Datastore, data.gov.uk and the European Data Portal provide 
585960
access to similar types of public sector data at city, national and multinational 
levels. These collections of public sector data are underpinned by a range of 
different software, such as CKAN, DataPress and InstantAtlas. 
616263
 
●Data observatories as collections of data by topic or theme​. Examples of 
this type are not generally referred to as data observatories but similarly gather 
data held by publicly funded organisations and provide users with tools to work 
with it. Examples in the UK include the Ministry of Housing, Communities and 
Local Government OpenDataCommunities, MAGIC, which provides access 
6465
to mapping tools and data about the natural environment from across UK 
government, and MEDIN, a portal for marine datasets from over 400 
66
organisations and data archive centres. UK government recently launched the 
“Ethnicity facts and figures” website, which it describes as “the first of its kind, 
bringing together and publishing ethnicity data collected by government in one 
place”. We found data observatories to be particularly prevalent in the health 
67
sector. The WHO Global Health Observatory, Public Health England (PHE) 
68
Fingertips (which replaced PHE’s network of health observatories) and PHE 
6970
data and analysis tools all represent collections of data related to different 
71
health topics, including by diseases or conditions. 
 
●Data observatories as academia-led initiatives​. Funded by the Newcastle 
University Science Central, the Urban Observatory is an attempt to provide 
72
access to data collected by real-time sensor feeds from across the city. It aims 
to provide a baseline for research into urban issues. A number of universities are 
involved in the global Web Observatory initiative to develop interactive real-time 
73
systems for capturing, storing and analysing data about the web and its users. 
In contrast to other examples of data observatories we have found, initiatives 
such as these involve the collection of data from new sources or in original 
ways, as well as enabling its presentation or analysis. 
 
●Data observatories as data sharing platforms​. Platforms that enable 
organisations to share data with one other, or with specific types of users,

can be interpreted as data observatories with limited access. For example, 
the Infectious Diseases Data Observatory seeks to provide a platform for the 
74
research community to share data, with access managed by data contributors 
and the wider community. Although access to the data can be restricted, the 
outputs of its use (such as reports and data visualisations) are made publicly 
available on the platform. Similarly, the Clinical Study Data Request (CSDR) 
platform, which consists of a consortium of pharmaceutical companies and 
75
other data providers, aims to support scientific decision-making and innovation 
by facilitating wider access to data. Researchers can use the platform to request 
access to anonymised patient-level data and/or supporting documents from 
clinical studies. CARTO Data Observatory software supports businesses 
76
to derive spatial insights for marketing, site planning and investment 
decision-making. It enables users to combine their own data with other 
demographic, economic and real estate datasets. 
 
●Data observatories as data and tools made available by private sector 
organisations​. A recent trend that can be associated with the concept of data 
observatories is private sector organisations making data about the use of their 
services publicly available. Uber Movement is an interactive mapping tool that 
enables the public to explore routes and travel times between areas of cities 
based on Uber passengers’ journeys. Its aim is “to help urban planning around 
the world”. Strava makes its Global Heatmap available for people to explore 
7778
the aggregate routes of cyclists and runners around the world. Its Metro tool 
aggregates data generated by millions of rides and runs (via individuals’ 
smartphones or GPS devices), and provides access to departments of 
transportation and city planning groups to improve infrastructure for bicyclists 
and pedestrians. 
79
 
●Data observatories as physical environments​. The majority of the data 
observatories we found are virtual and web-based. A few, however, are physical 
– such as the Data Observatory at Imperial College London, which consists of 
80
64 large screens for data visualisation, and the Bristol Data Dome. This 
81
category of data observatory would also include government control rooms of 
the past such as Project Cybersyn, an early 1970s attempt to build a system 
82
to receive, store and use information for decision-making by the 
Chilean government. 
 
●Data observatories as organisations, processes and teams​. The Kent 
Public Health Observatory is staffed by the Kent County Council. It produces 
83
analysis, knowledge and evidence to improve health and wellbeing across Kent, 
including in the form of health and social care maps, weekly bulletins and annual 
reports. Teams from across the council can contact the observatory and make 
requests for analysis, which are then reviewed, prioritised and completed.

These types of data observatories share some characteristics. In most cases, they define 
a particular “universe” to be observed, such as a theme or topic, or geographic area. 
Most provide tools for users to explore, analyse and interpret data. Their collective 
difference to data portals is that they are developed with a purpose, or set of purposes, 
in mind beyond aiding in the discovery of data. 
 
While the term “observatory” implies a certain neutrality, this purpose ties data 
observatories closely towards a particular set of data users, the impacts they are trying 
to understand and the decisions they are trying to make. In several cases there are 
multiple observatories with a different lens on the same thing – like a city or a sector – 
but meeting different sets of user needs. Data observatories might not provide 
recommendations or direct action, but the choices made about the data they 
incorporate, how different datasets are brought together and compared, and which 
timescales are considered, facilitate some kinds of analyses and limit others. 
The purpose of the data observatory, and the organisation that has made these choices, 
are important factors for those using them to consider. 
 
There are also some significant differences between the types of data observatories we 
found, which highlight factors to consider when designing data observatories for different 
user needs. For instance, they can allow for different granularities of data and analysis in 
terms of geography and time. Some enable users to explore monthly or yearly data at 
a regional level, whereas others enable users to explore data at the level of individual 
real-time sensors. The data observatories also have different models for funding, 
governance and sustainability – some are led by local authorities and others by 
academia or industry. 
4.2. In peer-to-peer accommodation 
There is a growing demand for data related to the impacts of peer-to-peer 
accommodation and the activities of the sharing or collaborative economy more widely. 
The Boston Hospitality Review has made the point that currently “there is little empirical 
evidence of the economic or social impacts of [peer-to-peer accommodation]... 
Thus, the course and the magnitude of these impacts do not go beyond speculation 
for the time being”. 
84
 
This demand for data was summarised by the Scottish Expert Advisory Panel on the 
Collaborative Economy report published in January 2017, which found that: 
85
 
●“the collaborative economy is data-rich, and many advances have been made in 
the use of data to guide public and policy choices and improve user experiences 
(for example live transport data sets)... Nonetheless, we do not have accurate 
and up-to-date data sets that show the impact of the collaborative economy 
in Scotland” 
●“without this input, the Scottish government cannot effectively understand 
the ongoing trends that are shaping its economy and communities”

The panel recommended that the Scottish government: 
 
●“set up an observatory into the collaborative economy... [to] collect, aggregate, 
analyse and publish a variety of datasets that show the ongoing impact of 
collaborative economy platforms in Scotland. This would be a new way for 
platforms (local authorities and conceivably workers) to agree to share certain 
data and would address the clear data and evidence gaps that exist in order 
to track activity and impacts” 
●“continue the work of this panel to bring together industry (both innovators 
and incumbents), policy makers and stakeholders in an open dialogue with 
regulators; and making the most of new tools for public engagement at scale 
as an input to deliberating decisions on regulation” 
●“resource the collection of an evidence base in considering restrictions on 
short-term rentals... taking into account the number of dedicated lets in any 
given area, the impact on rent/housing costs and the cost/benefit of loss of 
economic benefit to renters and the local areas” 
 
The comments made by the panel summarise wider demand for data that can be used 
to describe, provide evidence of and understand the impacts of peer-to-peer 
accommodation.  
 
Various examples of data observatories we found from other sectors and contexts may 
be applicable to the peer-to-peer accommodation market. Multiple data observatories 
could combine the features of numerous types of data observatory described in Section 
4.1. For example, one may exist as a collection of datasets by theme, use data and tools 
made available by platforms, and be designed as a tool to support policy-making in 
housing. A data observatory may be used by a national or local authority to inform their 
decisions about different interventions into the peer-to-peer accommodation market, 
or whether an intervention is required at all. Another could combine some of the same 
datasets, incorporate more data about fire, health and safety, and other incidents 
to assist in decisions about where to prioritise emergency services capacity.

5. Findings and 
recommendations  
5.1. Findings 
In summary of the findings described throughout this report: 
 
Stakeholders and the impacts of peer-to-peer accommodation they focus on 
 
1.A diverse set of stakeholders are interested in the impacts of peer-to-peer 
accommodation​. ​These stakeholders include local and national government 
officials, emergency services, and hotels and alternative providers of short-term 
accommodation. (p 4) 
 
2.Stakeholders are interested in a variety of different impacts of peer-to-peer 
accommodation​.​ These range from those that are more readily quantifiable, 
such as impacts on tourism and visitors, to the more abstract, including impacts 
on the desirability of an area and the sense of community. (p 5) 
 
3.Different stakeholders share interests in the same types of impacts of 
peer-to-peer accommodation​.​ For example, the impacts on tourism and visitors 
are of interest to statistical organisations such as the ONS, as well as residents 
and peer-to-peer accommodation platforms themselves. (p 6) 
 
4.Stakeholders are generally interested in the impacts of peer-to-peer 
accommodation for different purposes.​ ​For example, platforms will seek 
to understand the impacts of their activity and the market to make decisions 
to sustainably grow their businesses, while emergency services want to make 
decisions about where resources should be prioritised. (p 7) 
 
5.Stakeholders are interested in the impacts of peer-to-peer accommodation at 
different geographic and administrative levels​.​ Although some stakeholders are 
clearly defined in these terms – such as both local and national government 
officials – some stakeholders can be interested in impacts at multiple different 
levels. For example, a peer-to-peer accommodation platform may be interested 
in its impacts at local, national and international scales. (p 7) 
 
6.We are in the early stages of understanding the types of impacts peer-to-peer 
accommodation may have​. ​The rapid growth of the peer-to-peer 
accommodation market and the wider sharing or collaborative economy means 
that it can be difficult to identify types of impacts to attempt to describe, provide 
evidence of and understand. (p 7) 
 
7.Stakeholders want to increase their understanding of the impacts of 
peer-to-peer accommodation. ​Generally, the stakeholders we interviewed are 
seeking to improve their understanding of the impact of the market and its 
activity in order to make better decisions for their organisations. (p 7)

The role of data in understanding the impact of peer-to-peer accommodation 
 
8.The data that can be used to understand the various impacts of peer-to-peer 
accommodation has multiple sources​.​ These sources span the public and 
private sectors and different types of organisations, including local and national 
government, statistical organisations, and business and consumer surveying 
organisations. Indeed, one given impact may only be addressed using data from 
multiple sources, which may require coordination in order to combine them. 
(pp 8–15) 
 
9.Data that can be used to understand the impacts of peer-to-peer 
accommodation is not always easy to find and access.​ ​Data related to the 
various impacts are not made available consistently, nor in formats that make 
them readily usable as inputs into a study or analysis. (pp 14) 
 
10.Data that can be used to understand the impacts of peer-to-peer 
accommodation exists at different levels of geographic and administrative 
scope​.​ Data such as constituent reports may describe an individual incident, 
property or guest, whereas some of the studies and analyses published by 
academic institutions have a city-wide, or even regional, focus. (pp 8–15) 
 
11.Nearly all studies and analyses focus on the impacts of Airbnb rather than 
peer-to-peer accommodation platforms and activity more widely​. ​This appears 
to be due in part to Airbnb’s significant market share, but also the fact that 
third-party intermediaries do not currently scrape data from other platforms 
and make it available to other users. (pp 10) 
 
12.Peer-to-peer accommodation platforms hold vast amounts of data that could be 
used to understand the market’s impacts, but restricted access to this data 
inhibits its use​. ​Platforms such as Airbnb make some limited data available via 
reports, websites and ad hoc sharing arrangements, but do not share data with 
stakeholders (such as local and national government) or publish data in a routine 
or consistent way. This has fuelled the rise of third-party intermediaries such as 
AirDNA and Inside Airbnb, who provide access to data scraped from Airbnb and 
support a whole host of downstream studies, analyses and other activity. 
As a result of the reliance on scraped data, there is often debate surrounding 
the accuracy of the outputs of these activities as opposed to debate about the 
impacts of peer-to-peer accommodation. (p 11) 
 
13.The privacy implications related to the way in which data is currently used 
to​ ​understand the impact of peer-to-peer accommodation are unclear​. 
Although most platforms make their hosts’ listings publicly available, third-party 
intermediaries such as AirDNA and Inside Airbnb use, and enable others to use, 
the data they scrape for purposes beyond merely choosing a place to stay. 
Although some limited information about aggregation is published by these 
intermediaries, there does not appear to be much debate around this topic. 
(p 10) 
 
14.Not all data that can be used to understand the impacts of peer-to-peer 
accommodation is collected, managed or used in a coordinated way​. 
For example, while business surveys are explicitly designed to collect data 
about certain stakeholders and impacts, the reports from constituents referred 
to by politicians are not underpinned by a similarly robust process. Despite this, 
these informal descriptions contain rich information about people’s experiences 
of impact. A lack of structured data – or even the ability to describe a type of 
impact in a structured way – might make it difficult to evaluate the wider extent 
of an impact, but there may be evidence of it nonetheless. (p 10)

15.There is demand for increased access to data related to the impacts of 
peer-to-peer accommodation, including via a data observatory​.​ Developing 
a data observatory may be one approach to increasing access to data. 
Data infrastructure in the peer-to-peer accommodation market that is as open 
as possible, whilst respecting privacy, will support a breadth of different uses 
to help decision-making and drive innovation. (p15) 
 
 
Data observatories 
 
16.The term “data observatory” is used to describe a wide range of services 
outside of the peer-to-peer accommodation market​.​ ​Types of data observatories 
we found include collections of data held by the public sector, policy-making 
tools and even physical environments. (p 16) 
 
17.Data observatories outside of the peer-to-peer accommodation market have 
some similar characteristics, but also some significant differences​.​ The majority 
are defined by a theme, topic or geographic area, and provide tools for users to 
work with data. There are differences, however, in the organisations responsible 
for them and in the level of granularity of analysis they allow. (p 19) 
 
18.Data observatories could help increase understanding of the impacts of 
peer-to-peer accommodation.​ ​There is demand for more data that can be used 
to understand the impacts of peer-to-peer accommodation. Data observatories 
may help bring together datasets from different sources and provide tools for 
users to explore, analyse and interpret the data. (p 19) 
 
19.It is unlikely a single peer-to-peer accommodation data observatory will meet 
all​ ​stakeholder needs.​ ​In this report we have described a diverse set of 
stakeholders, impacts and types of data observatories. Given this diversity, 
it may be that – alongside other types of data infrastructure – multiple data 
observatories could support better understanding of the impacts of peer-to-peer 
accommodation. Data observatories could be scoped by a combination of 
factors, such as types of stakeholder, geography, and/or the type of impact that 
needs to be understood. (p 20)

5.2. Recommendations 
Improving the understanding of the impacts of peer-to-peer accommodation through 
access to data, evidence and informed debate is critical to ensuring that the decisions 
made by different stakeholders maximise the benefits of peer-to-peer accommodation 
and mitigate its costs. 
 
Based on the findings of our research, we have developed five recommendations 
focused on improving the understanding of the impact of peer-to-peer 
accommodation market:  
 
1. Public and private sector organisations that hold data should commit to 
working together to build data infrastructure that is as open as possible while 
respecting privacy and commercial confidentiality. 
 
Data infrastructure that is as open as possible will support decision-making and drive 
innovation. It will make it easier for stakeholders with different needs to understand 
impacts and make better decisions. Creating and using data observatories is one way 
to achieve this. 
 
Key stakeholders in creating, maintaining and improving this data infrastructure include 
local and national government officials, peer-to-peer accommodation platforms and 
statistical organisations. 
 
The ODI's data infrastructure principles provide some guidance to help ensure that this 
86
infrastructure is built incrementally and that it meets data user needs. 
 
2. National government officials should facilitate and support the creation of 
open data infrastructure in the peer-to-peer accommodation market and the 
development of data observatories. 
 
It is in national government's interest for local government to have the powers it needs 
to make decisions that are devolved to it, and access to the data that will help it make 
those decisions. National government officials should help facilitate conversations and 
encourage private sector organisations to publish and share data to a useful standard. 
It should also ensure that local government has any new powers that it requires to 
undertake new types of intervention, and, potentially, powers to compel the release 
of certain types of data from organisations if needed. 
 
3. Local government officials should create environments that can support the 
development of data observatories. 
 
Recent ODI research has identified three patterns for using open data in the delivery 
of public services. One of these patterns focused on using data to build services that 
87
support more informed policy development. This pattern could describe the future 
development of a data observatory, or multiple data observatories, to support better 
understanding of the peer-to-peer accommodation market. 
 
This research also identified the characteristics of environments in which these types of 
services are built – such as organisational collaboration, strong technology infrastructure, 
digital skills and literacy, open standards for data, and peer networks.

Creating this environment will need a senior champion – such as a local mayor, chief 
executive or chief data officer – who can use their convening or regulatory powers to 
bring together the multiple stakeholders in the public and private sectors who hold data 
and those who want to use it to make better decisions. 
 
4. Stakeholders with similar needs should develop data observatories 
collaboratively. 
 
Different stakeholders seeking to understand the impacts of peer-to-peer 
accommodation may have shared needs that can be met by a data observatory. 
These needs may cluster based on types of stakeholder (such as officials across a local 
authority), geography (such as particular local area), and/or the type of impact in focus 
(such as tourism).  
 
Public sector design standards, like those developed by the ​UK's Government Digital 
Service​ or the ​US Digital Service​, provide guidance on how to design services. 
Data standards are also an important part of data infrastructure – the ODI has shared 
findings on approaches to developing standards and the impact of open data standards.
 The development of data observatories may also help to build out wider data 
88
infrastructure, as each one may highlight the need for additional types or sources 
of data, which engaged data holders can work together to release, improve or share.  
 
5. Local and national government officials should engage with different 
stakeholders to inform decision-making related to the impacts of peer-to-peer 
accommodation. 
 
A better understanding of the impacts of peer-to-peer accommodation will help 
policymakers to make informed decisions. It is important, however, that these decisions 
are also informed by input from stakeholders such as statistical organisations, academic 
and research institutions, independent researchers and residents. This input is key to 
gathering data or information that is not collected, managed or used in a structured way, 
such as the reports of individuals who may have benefited from the peer-to-peer 
accommodation market and those who may have been adversely affected.
