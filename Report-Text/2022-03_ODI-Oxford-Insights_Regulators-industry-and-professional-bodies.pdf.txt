3.2 What can be assured?
‘Data practices and datasets: what can be assured’ by Open Data Institute, used a CC-BY-SA licence.
The ODI have suggested that assurance can be applied to:
●
Data— e.g. an individual dataset.
●
Data practices— e.g. the processes by which datais collected or managed.
Assuranceofdataanddatapracticesinvolvesapplyingarangeofdifferentdataassurance
activities.
Assurance of data focuses on data or a dataset as an artefact. It includes activities like:
●
Checking the quality of individual data points to assess their accuracy.

Reviewing a dataset to ensure it does not contain personal data.

Scope and powers
Takenbroadly,allthreetypesoforganisationhavepowersincommonandalsodifferencesin
scope and authority. All three types of organisation conduct work to:
●
Define principles, such as codes of practice.
●
Influence and shape regulation and best practices.
●
Develop and enforce professional norms and ethics.
●
Take action to censure organisations and individuals that breach rules.
●
Build skills through professional development and training.

All three of these bodies are involved in general assurance activities, such as:
●
Developing standards and processes for common activities.
●
Developing standards for audit or review.
●
Carrying out certification of individuals and organisations.

Glossary
Data access initiative:initiatives or programmeswith a strong focus on collecting, using and
sharing data as part of their work, involving multiple stakeholders actively working together to
solve a problem. They often have a clear challenge, in the form of a specific social,
environmental or economic problem that is the focus for the collaboration.
Data assurance: the process, or set of processes,that increase confidence that data will
meet a specific need, and that organisations collecting, accessing, using and sharing data are
doing so in trustworthy ways
Data assurance activity: a specific activity to createtrust in data, such as conducting an
audit, validating a dataset, or carrying out training
Data assurance scheme: a specific project that worksby applying one or more data
assurance activities and may involve multiple actors
Data ecosystem: data infrastructure and the people,communities and organisations that
benefit from the value created by it
Data literacy: the ability to think critically aboutdata in different contexts and examine the
impact of different approaches when collecting, using and sharing data and information
Data practices:the processes by which data is collected,shared, held and/or managed
Quality infrastructure: formal mechanisms of assurancesuch as standardisation, conformity
assessment, measurement or accreditation
Standards:documented, reusable agreements that solvea specific set of problems or meet
clearly defined needs, often used to help define or support a data assurance activity
Trustworthy data ecosystem:an environment in whichindividuals and organisations across
the public, private and third sector trust that data is flowing in ways that will maximise benefits
whilst minimising harms
