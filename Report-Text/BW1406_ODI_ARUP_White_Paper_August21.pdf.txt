Foreword from Arup
At Arup, we decided to change how we work with 
data. We understood in 2018 that the status quo 
was no longer delivering on key strategies for 
sustainability, inclusion and digitisation. A rethink 
was required to maintain our competitive advantage 
and our ability to shape a better world.
In 2019 we reached out to clients, our 
members
 and partners such as the Open 
Data Institute (ODI); to listen and prototype 
new ways
 of working. We were guided by 
our first data strategy, the ‘Data Target 
Operating Model’. Progress was made 
in working with asset management data 
in civil engineering, the use of natural 
language processing in our corporate 
services, the application of machine 
learning in structural engineering or 
agent-based models in urban planning 
and climate change work. Towards the 
end of this phase, we developed our 
research programme ‘Data Supernova’ to 
help identify and shape critical trends.
Throughout this work it became clear 
what we needed to do in the second 
phase of our data strategy ‘Creativity 
with Data at Scale’; we have to change 
and transform our vision, leadership, 
our data infrastructure and science, our 
data-enabled innovation, together with 
our knowledge, culture and practices.
This was
 not enough. Arup is not an island. 
Hence we focused ‘Data Supernova’ 
on two key topics: data infrastructure 
for market openness and data enabled 
sustainable development goals. In this 
report we focus on how the built world 
can reduce the cost and friction between 
our clients and us, partners and the 
ever-growing market for refined data.
It is a first step, with the ODI towards an 
open innovation process that can lead to 
comprehensive changes in our industries.
This report provides critical 
foundational concepts including 
three approaches for sharing:
•the default model of bilateral
data-sharing agreements
•newer approaches for data pooling
•decentralised publishing initiatives
What we envision is that as sectors such 
as energy and the construction industry 
move towards market openness, all three of 
these activities can take place symbiotically 
and create a data market-place in which:
1.Cost and friction are both reduced,
leading to industry wide efficiencies,
economic growth and enabling
sustainable development goals;
2.Commercial and social platforms
for data sharing can prosper; an
d
3. Data Institutions such as Data
trusts or Open Implementation
Entities will emerge.
Since this report was published in 
March 2021, I have developed a visual 
representation to illustrate ‘Data 
Infrastructure for Market Openness’ 
(see below). I hope readers will find it 
helpful in further understanding these 
concepts. It is a model where bilateral 
sharing, data pooling and decentralised 
publishing all act in harmony:

Open Data Institute | March 2021 | Whitepaper 3
It
 is   exciting to see 2021 as the year 
when these newer approaches begin to 
deliver value. The decentralised initiative 
from Icebreaker One is a step change for 
Open Energy, and there is momentum 
behind the idea for a data trust for 
construction or data boards in cities.
I would like to thank our team in Arup and 
the ODI for another excellent collaboration. 
The ODI is an organisation we trust as a 
neutral host for the development of data 
institutions. They share our interest in 
designing or catalysing markets to move 
towards the production of greater social, 
environmental and economic value from 
data. As a result, it is an excellent (and 
agnostic) partner for this
 project.
We will further explore data infrastructure 
for market openness and data enabled 
sustainable development goals at the ODI 
Summit in November. Please get in touch

Executive summary
We create value from data when it is used. This means that 
data needs to be accessible to those who can use it well. 
It needs to be at the right point on the data spectrum.
Data has the potential to help us tackle 
a variety of social, environmental and 
economic problems. Solving the biggest 
challenges requires sharing data not just 
within organisations, but also between 
partners and across sectors. This requires 
investment in the data infrastructure 
that can help us to use data well.
Like other industries, the organisations 
designing, building, operating and 
maintaining the built environment are 
looking at how to create value from 
data. In this paper we explore some of 
the challenges and opportunities.
There are a range of existing approaches 
for increasing access to data and 
open, collaborative models for building 
and maintaining the necessary data 
infrastructure. Data-sharing agreements 
are the default model for sharing data 
between organisations and for engaging 
with researchers. They shape how data 
is used by providing clarity around the 
rights, responsibilities and permitted 
forms of reuse. But other models exist.
Pooling data from multiple organisations 
allows data to be aggregated and analysed 
in ways that individual organisations cannot 
achieve by themselves. For example, to 
support benchmarking and analytics that 
can increase efficiency or improve safety. 
With strong governance and investment 
in centralised infrastructure, organisations 
can feel comfortable that data is being 
used within a trusted environment. 
But centralised approaches to sharing 
and governing data are not suitable for all 
scenarios. Initiatives like open banking, 
use another approach based around 
decentralised publishing of data using open 
standards and a common framework that 
governs how data is accessed, used and 
shared. This works well when data is best 
shared by those who collect and maintain it.
The right approach depends on the 
purpose of sharing data. We need to be 
clear on the challenges to be solved before 
building our shared-data infrastructure.
Smart buildings and digital twins can 
help us tackle a number of common 
challenges, including the urgent need to 
adapt to a changing climate. We highlight 
how increasing access to data can 
contribute to tackling those challenges 
and discuss how building stronger 
data infrastructure and independent 
stewardship of data and open standards 
are important to achieving that goal.

‘A manifesto for sharing 
engineering data’
2.  Open Data Institute (2020), 
‘Data institutions’
Introduction
Around the world we are facing a range of social, 
economic and environmental challenges. A safer, 
sustainable and more resilient future will require us 
to innovate and adapt the ways in which we engineer 
and maintain the built environment, including our 
infrastructure, energy and transport networks. 
Some data generated in the built 
environment sector will be either 
commercially sensitive or personal.  
This data should remain private. But there 
are other datasets that could be made 
more accessible. Increasing access to 
data held by both the public and private 
sector will allow it to be used in ways that 
increase safety and productivity, drive 
innovation, tackle climate change and 
enable sustainable growth. To unlock 
that value we need to ensure that data is 
accessed, used and shared in ways that 
are both trustworthy and sustainable.
In 2019, in collaboration with the Lloyd’s 
Register Foundation, we published ‘A 
manifesto for sharing engineering data’. 
1 
Our manifesto describes a set of principles 
to help increase access to data and 
drive innovation across the engineering 
and built environment sectors. One year 
on from the manifesto, it is time to put 
more of these principles into practice. 
This paper explores how the principles 
relating to the sharing and stewardship 
of data might be put into practice. We do 
this by exploring two built environment 
use cases: smart buildings and digital 
twins, but there are other examples that 
could be drawn from across the sector.
To set the scene we explore how other 
sectors are adapting to use data well and 
review several approaches for increasing 
access to data while mitigating potential 
harmful impacts from its use. These 
approaches include the creation of 
data institutions – organisations whose 
purpose involves stewarding data on 
behalf of others, often towards public, 
educational or charitable aims.

Unlocking the value of data 
for the built environment
We unlock value from data when it is used. Data needs 
to be shared and published in ways that build trust 
and ensure it is used ethically, legally and securely.
3
Building a shared vision for using data 
well requires a common understanding 
of not just the benefits of sharing 
data, but also the infrastructure and 
governance needed to support its use.
A first step is recognising that 
data exists on a spectrum, from 
closed, shared to open. 
•Open data is data that is available for
anyone to access, use and share. It is
published under an open licence that
allows it to be used for any purpose.
•Shared data is data that is only
available to certain people or
groups, such as researchers. Data
that is shared will typically be made
available for specific purposes that
are defined by, for example, a data-
sharing agreement. There are many
ways in which data can be made
accessible, or ‘shared’, with others. 
4
•Closed data is data that is held
privately within an organisation,
such as employment contracts,
policies or sales reports.
•Diagram 1 shows how data from
the energy sector would be
applied to the Data Spectrum.
By making data as open as possible – 
while protecting privacy, commercial 
confidentiality and national security 
– we can unlock more value from it.
Our research into the benefits of sharing 
data in the private sector 
5
 found that 
sharing data – between suppliers, 
partners and with customers – creates 
new opportunities, increases revenue, 
reduces direct costs and improves 
efficiency in operations. In addition to 
direct benefits for individual organisations, 
data can also be used to solve a range 
of economic and social challenges, for 
example helping businesses adapt to a 
changing climate or responding to the 
coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic.

Better use of data from the built 
environment can help to: 
7
•increase productivity in construction
and engineering through better
collaboration across the supply
chain and asset lifecycle
•enable open innovation, such as,
by including more communities and
organisations in the development
of services, helping to create
new technologies and insights or
developing new approaches to
designing, building and maintaining
aspects of the built environment
•driving economic growth by
enabling new business models and
cost savings across the engineering
and construction sector
•reduce impact on the environment
by reducing waste in construction
or engineering processes or
through better management of
energy and water resources.
Data about the built environment 
must be at the right point on the 
Data Spectrum, but it must also be 
supported by the data infrastructure 
that enables and governs its use. 
The ‘Data for the public good’ report 
8 
highlights just that: data is now as much a 
critical component of national infrastructure 
as steel, bricks and mortar. Our data 
infrastructure consists of shared data 
assets, the standards and technologies that 
enable its use, the policies and guidance 
that inform how data is used and managed 
and the organisations that govern it 
9
.
Data infrastructure needs to be maintained 
in the same way that our physical 
infrastructure also needs to be maintained. 
To ensure sustainable access to data and 
to help unlock value over the long term, 
our regional, national and international 
data infrastructure will need to be planned, 
invested in and strengthened over time.

Insights from other sectors
Data and digital transformations are driving changes 
across all sectors, not just the built environment. There 
are many examples of how adopting open, collaborative 
approaches are helping to tackle social, environmental 
and economic challenges through sharing data. 
So how are other sectors working together 
to understand how to share data and 
build the necessary data infrastructure 
and institutions to govern it?
For insights, we briefly look at how both 
the banking and agriculture sectors have 
been responding to the opportunities 
presented by increasing access to data. 
These examples highlight the importance 
of finding the right combination of sharing 
models, governance and collaborative 
approaches that will help to tackle 
challenges in the built environment.
Open banking – using data and 
standards to drive innovation
Following its investigation into competition 
in UK banking, the Competition and 
Markets Authority (CMA) mandated the 
UK’s largest banks to launch the Open 
Banking initiative, whose aim is to ‘stimulate 
innovation across the financial sector,  
to enable the “unbundling” of complex  
retail banking products (in particular 
personal and business current 
accounts) and to ultimately lead to 
greater competition overall.’ 
10
The Open Banking Working Group was 
set up in 2015 for two primary purposes. 
Firstly to explore how data could be 
used to help people to transact, save, 
borrow, lend and invest their money, and 
thus improve their banking experience. 
And secondly, to begin development 
of the necessary open standards 
that would enable access to data. 
The CMA determined there would need 
to be a central implementation 
11
 entity to 
develop the standards, build the supporting 
infrastructure and coordinate and drive 
implementation. 
11
 So the Open Banking 
Implementation Entity (OBIE) was created 
to oversee the implementation of the 
regulation, work with the banks to design 
the technical standard and to support 
adoption. To be successful, there needed 
to be an independent, trusted central 
entity to steward the standards, coordinate 
across the sector and ultimately, drive 
change. The creation of the Open Banking 
Standard guides how banking data should 
be created, shared and used, facilitating 
the move to openness, alongside specific 
challenges to increase innovation. 
Spurred on by regulatory changes 
mentioned above, the banking sector is 
now beginning to benefit from the adoption 
of a new standard for open banking. The 
ability for a broader range of organisations 
to access data on banking products and 
customer transaction histories is leading 
to the creation of more innovative products 
and services. By granting trusted third 
parties access to data, customers can 
more easily switch current accounts, gain 
access to personal finance dashboards, 
as well as make more accurate loan 
and credit-referencing decisions.

Open Data Institute | March 2021 | Whitepaper 9
A recent review 
12
 of the impact of open 
banking found that, while the initiative is 
still early in its development, it has evolved 
to add value to customers and service 
providers on broader financial management 
issues, as well as delivering on its intended 
purpose: to stimulate innovation. The 
model initially adopted by the UK is now 
being replicated worldwide. The approach 
illustrates the role of regulation in shaping 
data-access arrangements within a 
sector, the speed of data innovation 
once the necessary data infrastructure 
is available, the ability for innovative 
models to spread to other countries 
and the importance of independent 
stewardship of both data and standards.
Agriculture – using data to 
enable collaboration 
By 2030, the agricultural productivity and 
incomes of small-scale food producers 
need to double to achieve food security 
and promote sustainable agriculture 
13
. The 
rapidly increasing availability of data has 
huge potential to improve the agriculture 
sector and address food and nutrition 
challenges. Supported by government 
funding, a range of organisations across 
the agriculture, nutrition and digital sectors 
are collaborating to increase access 
to data to address food security and 
nutrition challenges. Global Open Data for 
Agriculture and Nutrition (GODAN) Action 
14
 
was a three-year project that began in 
2017, to enable data producers, stewards 
and users to engage effectively with open 
data and maximise its potential to bring 
a positive impact in the agriculture and 
nutrition sectors. The project focused 
on three key areas of work: standards, 
impact and capacity building.
Each partner organisation brings unique 
skills and experience to contribute to the 
project, which has engaged many different 
groups to improve understanding and use 
of open data – training over 1,000 data 
producers, stewards and users around 
the world. The project has created tools to 
facilitate discovery and use of standards 
for agricultural and geospatial data across 
diverse communities of practice. It has 
also made recommendations to improve 
the discovery, interoperability and use 
of data across the sector. The GODAN 
Action project highlights how a range of 
organisations, working in collaboration, 
can drive change across an industry and 
can help to drive change, operating in a 
similar way to the ODI Peer Networks. 
15
 
GODAN Action has led to the creation of 
new data infrastructure, including shared-
data assets, standards and new institutions 
to manage and provide access to that data. 
One example being the Africa Regional 
Data Cube, which works to harness ‘the 
latest Earth observation data and satellite 
technology to help Ghana, Kenya, Sierra 
Leone, Senegal and Tanzania address 
various issues relating to agriculture, food 
security, deforestation, urbanization, water 
access and more.’ 
16
 Coordinated action 
between a group of actors has resulted in 
an approach that is demand led, increases 
capacity building and is sustainable, which 
will help to deliver better decision making 
and progress towards achieving the UN 
2030 Sustainable Development Goals. 
17
  
The GODAN Action programme benefited 
from having a strong emphasis on 
collaboration to develop standards and 
create shared-data assets for the sector.

Three approaches to data 
sharing and governance
There are numerous approaches to sharing data.
18
  
Each model has its own strengths and weaknesses. 
Choosing the right model depends on 
a wide range of factors including:
• the length of time over which data will be 
shared, which might dictate the level and 
type of technical infrastructure required
• the volume and type of data to be 
shared, which might require specific 
governance or technical protection
• the maturity and scale of 
the data ecosystem. 
Our report on sharing engineering data 
noted ‘The engineering sector needs to 
explore and use the full range of data-
access models, creating new institutions 
where needed, to help build a data 
ecosystem where important data is 
accessible and data is used and shared 
in trustworthy ways.’ 
19
 The same is 
true for the built environment sector. 
In this section we outline some the 
strengths and weaknesses of three 
approaches for increasing access to data: 
data-sharing agreements, decentralised 
publishing initiatives and data pooling. 
The last two involve the creation of data 
institutions – organisations whose purpose 
involves stewarding data on behalf of 
others, often towards public, educational 
or charitable aims. 
20
 Data institutions come 
in different shapes and sizes and, like the 
OBIE and the African Regional Data Cube, 
they can fulfil different roles in their data 
ecosystem. But they are becoming an 
important part of how we move data along 
the data spectrum while preserving trust.
1. The default model:  
data-sharing agreements
The typical model for sharing data 
between two organisations are data-
sharing agreements. On the ODI Data 
Spectrum, data-sharing agreements are 
defined as ‘named access’. These are 
legal contracts that define a close, direct 
relationship between organisations. 
They define how data will be shared, 
the purposes for which it will be used 
and the roles and responsibilities 
of the individual organisations.
Data-sharing agreements are used in a 
variety of circumstances, such as to share 
data with suppliers and partners. They 
are frequently used to enable sharing 
of data with researchers and startups 
as part of open-innovation models. 
The Data Pitch challenge programme 
used data-sharing agreements to facilitate 
sharing of data between a variety of 
organisations to tackle a variety of 
challenges 
21
 such as futureproofing retail 
supply chains, smart manufacturing 
and innovative approaches to reduce 
traffic congestion. The programme 
successfully demonstrates how simple 
data-sharing models can quickly unlock 
more value from data, providing direct 
benefits to individual organisations.

sustainable data sharing and innovation, which aims to help decision makers work 
towards net zero through the use of data. This diagram shows an exploration of 
approaches to data sharing, created by Icebreaker One to ‘stimulate discussion’.
Strengths of data-sharing agreements 
include that they:
Weaknesses of data-sharing 
agreements include that:
•      build direct relationships between 
partners and suppliers
•    provide specific, clear controls 
over use of data, including defining 
purpose and time limits 
•      are suitable for sharing data 
with a wide variety of different 
organisations and researchers.
•    they can be difficult to negotiate  
and agree access
•      creation of custom legal agreements  
is costly and time consuming
•      they are primarily designed 
for 1:1 sharing of data
•      they typically draw on bespoke  
or non-standard models for sharing 
data, increasing integration costs  
for data consumers.

12 Open Data Institute | March 2021 | WhitepaperExploring new approaches for sharing data in the built environment
2. Coordinating access to data via 
decentralised publishing initiatives
Data consumers often need access to 
the same data, from multiple sources. 
Negotiating data-sharing agreements can 
be time-consuming and costly. Lack of 
coordination around how data is shared, 
leads to bespoke technical approaches that 
further increase costs and add friction.
An alternative approach are ‘decentralised 
publishing initiatives’. These are 
industry-wide collaborations that involve 
multiple organisations publishing or 
sharing data directly from their own 
infrastructure, using open standards 
that define how data is being accessed, 
used and shared within a standard legal 
framework or via an open licence.
We have documented 14 examples of 
these types of initiative, which include 
programmes like Open Banking, 
OpenActive and OpenContracting. 
22
 
New initiatives like Icebreaker 
One’s Open Energy project 
23
 are 
also adopting this model. 
This decentralised approach addresses 
some of the issues with simple data-sharing 
agreements by defining a standard model 
for accessing, using and sharing specific 
types of data across a sector or industry.
The work of developing the open 
standard, common legal frameworks 
and shared tools and technology can 
be undertaken by a group of parties or 
a single data institution, to coordinate 
the cross-sector collaboration.
Strengths of decentralised publishing 
initiatives include that:
Weaknesses of decentralised 
publishing initiatives include that:
•    organisations retain stewardship of data
•    collaborative approaches build 
relationships across a sector
•      the potential for lock-ins is reduced 
due to the use of open standards 
and common legal frameworks
•      they are applicable to a wide 
variety of use cases across sectors, 
geographies and data types.
•      additional effort and investment 
is required to drive creation and 
adoption of open standards
•      data consumers may still need 
to find and integrate a large 
number of data providers
•      data stewards are required to create 
their own infrastructure to support 
sharing and publishing of data.

3. Data pooling
Decentralised publishing of data can help 
to reshape how data is shared across 
sectors through the use of open standards, 
but sometimes it is necessary to aggregate 
data to unlock its value. Pooling of data 
from multiple sources can help to create a 
critical mass of data that can be analysed 
to create insights that are impossible for 
individual organisations to do themselves.
Benchmarking – the sharing of data 
and metrics across an organisation or 
sector to compare performance – is a 
common example. By sharing data with 
a central body it becomes possible to 
compare data on operations, performance, 
finances and a range of other indicators, 
including salaries, diversity and safety 
practices, allowing companies to 
benchmark themselves and so make 
better decisions about how they operate.
These central bodies are data institutions 
that act as a trusted intermediary, 
providing the necessary oversight and 
governance around the shared data, 
enabling those contributing to the pool of 
data to trust that it will only be accessed, 
used and shared in agreed ways.
HiLo, a data institution in the maritime 
sector, supports sharing of safety and 
accident data across the sector. By 
analysing the aggregated data it is able to 
provide individual insights to the companies 
contributing data. HiLo has helped to save

of whether they are being met
•      they enable and support 
analysis and use of data across 
multiple organisations
•    contributing organisations can 
remain involved in ongoing 
governance and stewardship
•      they provide a common technical 
platform for analysis, use and 
onward sharing of data.
•      there are additional costs of 
setting up and sustaining a 
central platform and technical 
infrastructure to aggregate data
•      risks increase, such as from data 
breaches, when key datasets are held 
by a single organisation or infrastructure 
•    benchmarking requires standardised 
data collection so that true 
comparisons can be drawn.

Increasing access to data 
from smart buildings
Buildings of all types, including offices, shops, schools 
and entertainment venues are increasingly being 
fitted with sensors and connectivity that are providing 
access to new sources of data. This includes data 
from an increasingly diverse range of sources, not 
just energy or water usage, but observations from wifi 
access points, bluetooth beacons, cameras, lighting 
systems, air quality sensors and door locks.
Who might benefit from increased 
access to data and how?
Better access to and use of data from smart 
buildings would have significant benefit for 
property managers and  
building occupants. 
For example, ‘data collected by motion 
and occupancy sensors at a building level 
[can be used] to regulate air-conditioning 
and lighting in real time, thereby reducing 
energy costs and optimizing the internal 
environment for its intended purpose.’ 
27
 
At the White Collar Factory in Shoreditch, 
London, metering is ‘implemented at a 
very detailed level and is expected to 
provide valuable information on how 
the building performs in practice.’ 
28
 
The data can also lead to more efficient 
building maintenance, as ‘the continuous 
monitoring and predictive capability of 
Internet of Things (IoT)-enabled buildings 
can also preempt a repair or maintenance 
issue by enabling a building manager to 
take appropriate corrective action before 
tenants even notice a problem.’ 
29
Arup has also been researching the benefit 
of smart buildings during the coronavirus 
pandemic, theorising that ‘on-site 
assessments, computational modelling 
and simulations can quickly identify high-
risk areas, such as poor ventilation. 
This allows operators to recognise the 
sources of pollution and optimises the 
building’s operation and management.’ 
30
Increasing access to data can also 
support other stakeholders:
• Tenants might be offered more control 
over lighting, heating and ventilation, 
as well as better services, for example, 
offering more flexible spaces and 
easier interactions with spaces such 
as booking meeting rooms, personal 
room temperatures and customisable 
food and beverage options.
• CEOs and COOs may be able to better 
understand their building use and 
connected environmental impacts, 
allowing them to reduce their carbon 
footprint and save on capital costs.
• Researchers could use data to evaluate 
and compare building performance. 
They could also use this to monitor any 
effect that the proliferation of smart 
buildings has on meeting energy reduction 
targets and hold organisations in poor-
performing buildings to account. 
• With access to standardised data and 
interfaces, startups might offer new 
tools, products and services utilising 
the data generated by smart buildings.

• Society can benefit from buildings 
contributing less to the climate crisis. 
Stronger data infrastructure for smart 
buildings can help to fight the climate 
emergency and support other sector’s 
initiatives such as the EU’s Energy 
Performance of Buildings Directive.
On a macro level, data can support the 
built environment sector to ask and answer 
bigger questions. Are office blocks an 
efficient use of capital resources for an 
organisation? Has the coronavirus pandemic 
changed our reliance on office space? If 
we have offices, where should they be: city 
centre, business parks or suburbs? What 
impact do they have on the environment 
and on the community around the sites? 
Where are the challenges in sharing  
and using this data?
Currently, in the UK, data from smart 
buildings is siloed. This begins during design 
and construction, when digital plans are 
handed between multiple organisations 
over the early lifecycle of the building. 
These silos continue once the building 
is occupied and functional – leading to 
fragmentation across data platforms, services 
and infrastructure across the sector. As 
Arup commented: ‘Too often buildings’ IT 
packages are more of an after-thought, 
something to fit in, not an opportunity 
to be seized.’ 
31
 For the promise of smart 
buildings to be realised, these vertical silos 
must be broken down so that data can 
be accessed and shared more easily.
The increasing amount of data that is used 
to monitor buildings and workplaces also 
raises potential ethical and privacy concerns. 
Data from smart offices could be designed 
or repurposed as a form of workplace 
surveillance, 
32
 leading to harmful impacts 
for workers. Increased use of data in offices 
could ‘potentially [result] in the disclosure of 
data that people might not feel comfortable 
disclosing (such as where they go, what 
they do, when and with whom they spend 
time, whether they are healthy and more)’. 
33
Understanding and addressing such ethical 
and privacy issues within smart buildings are 
vital. It would be hasty to roll out experimental 
technologies, such as the IoT and sensors, 
without understanding the potential negative 
aspects on people and the environment.
While there are potential benefits from 
using data to reduce carbon footprints, 
there is a need for a balanced approach 
to data collection and use. Not only do 
the environmental impact of the additional 
sensors need to be factored in, but also the 
ongoing financial and environmental costs of 
storing the data in servers, which worldwide, 
has a significant impact on the environment. 
34
 
Where could new data-access 
approaches help?
Addressing the above challenges requires 
the creation of a stronger, more-open 
data infrastructure for smart buildings. 
This infrastructure will be based on 
open standards and clear policies and 
guidance that will clarify the rights and 
responsibilities around how data is 
being collected, used and shared.
A new data-access approach could bring 
benefits, for example to benchmark data for 
the sector. A new set of initiatives could help 
to coordinate the creation and adoption of 
open standards – to help to standardise how 
data is being accessed, used and shared 
between different systems, services and 
buildings throughout a building’s lifecycle. 
These standards should be developed in the 
open, mirroring the standards development in 
Open Banking and Open Energy and learning 
from collaborative initiatives to manage 
infrastructure such as Project 13. BDNS 
(Building Device Naming Standard), for the 
naming of data producing devices such as 
sensors or lights, is the first of these initiatives 
towards creating ‘Open Property’ in a similar 
way. Once the data is standardised, it can 
be pooled from various sources, allowing 
comparison of the performances of buildings 
across a number of metrics, including 
occupancy, environmental efficiency, 
finances and safety. This organisation could 
perform a similar role that HiLo does in the 
maritime sector, leading to more efficient, 
safer and healthier buildings. Whether a data 
institution is the right fit for this problem will 
require further analysis, but the cases of 
Open Banking, HiLo and Project 13 should 
provide an idea of how it could operate. 
A data institution could also act as an 
independent steward of data to assist in 
addressing the ethical and privacy concerns 
around data from smart buildings. Data 
institutions offer potential to provide 
strong, participatory governance around 
data, involving owners, operators, tenants 
and workers in decision making.

Sharing data to enable the 
development of digital twins
Pairing physical roads, bridges and buildings with a 
‘digital twin’ – ‘a realistic digital representation of assets, 
processes or systems in the built or natural environment’ – 
could be the key to more efficient decision making, design 
and maintenance and increased safety. It is important to 
emphasise that ‘digital twins are a methodology, not a 
technology. It is an approach and way of working,  
enabled by connecting the physical and digital worlds’.
35
The Centre for Digital Built Britain (CDBB) 
and the Digital Framework Task Group 
developed the Gemini Principles, 
36
 to 
articulate a set of proposed principles 
to guide the creation of stronger data 
infrastructure for the built environment. 
The principles are organised under three 
overarching themes: purpose, trust and 
function and are intended to create 
alignment in the industry, stress the 
benefits of sharing data for the public good 
and provide a context within which key 
questions can be identified and addressed.
Increased data sharing in the built 
environment sector has the potential to 
positively impact multiple parts of society. 
For the economy, there are potential 
improvements to national infrastructure 
productivity, security and measurements 
of outcomes, alongside increases in 
collaboration, innovation and safety. 
Greater data sharing in itself could release 
an additional £7bn per year of benefits 
across the UK infrastructure sectors. 
37
Who might benefit from increased 
access to data and how?
According to the CDBB, the National 
Digital Twin programme has the potential to 
benefit society in a far greater way than any 
other investment in the built environment 
sector, 
38
 including everything from better 
health and wellness in office environments 
to improved air quality in our dense urban 
environments. 
39
 Digital twins will improve 
transparency, create better outcomes 
for the customer (often the public) and 
deliver higher satisfaction to the user. 
• Local and national governments are 
better able to understand how different 
events will impact their infrastructure.  
A digital twins approach will create more 
useful insights, enabling better decision 
making. For example, the ‘Breathing City’ 
project is improving the wellbeing and 
safety of urban populations and provides 
valuable insights to educate society 
on the impact of pollution through the 
collection of environmental data to inform 
a digital twin approach.

data to create a digital model of Leeds.

• A collaborative project between 
Newcastle University and Northumbrian 
Water Group is an example of how 
infrastructure owners can better 
respond to incidents in the water 
network, such as burst pipes or heavy 
rainfall thanks to a digital twins approach. 
The ‘Twincident’ 
41
 model uses geospatial 
data, such as land-cover maps and light 
detection and ranging (LIDAR) maps 
to create a model of Newcastle and 
surrounding areas. This is integrated 
with water company infrastructure 
data and complemented with dynamic 
weather data and environmental data 
such as traffic and air quality data 
to build a full picture of the city.
• There are considerable benefits to 
businesses, through the creation of a 
new market, improved efficiency to the 
entire value chain, reduced uncertainty 
and better risk management. For 
example, engineers at General Electric 
& Rolls Royce use sensor data in their 
engines, to measure everything from 
the temperature of the exhausts, to 
the speed of the turbines to improve 
performance. 
42
 Similar methods are 
used by NASA when building their space 
shuttles and in Formula One cars. 
• In a broader sense, a National Digital 
Twin will create less disruption and 
waste, more reuse and better efficiency, 
all of which create environmental 
benefits through a more circular 
economy in the built environment. 
Where are the challenges in 
sharing and using this data?
To build an effective digital twin approach, 
a range of data is required and that data 
must be shared openly across multiple 
sectors in a machine-readable format. 
Agreeing on standards, a common 
language for different stakeholders 
across different domains, takes time and 
coordination and will impact the ability 
to connect twins, which may result in 
issues for owners of single assets, such 
as vendor lock-in and lack of evolution.
Retrofitting ageing complex infrastructure 
with the technology necessary for a digital 
twins approach may be more difficult 
than creating new physical, digital-ready 
assets from scratch, one example of 
which is wifi black spots in old buildings. 
Physical infrastructure changes at a 
much slower pace than the worlds of 
software and data. Integrating the two 
in an ecosystem of digital twins may be 
very hard, slow and costly as a result.
Buy-in to the digital twins approach will 
be important. Some organisations may 
implement overly complex, unnecessary 
systems and lose faith in digital twins or 
a critical mass could choose to stick with 
current technologies rather than invest in 
a digital twins approach. Asset owners 
need to find the right level of complexity 
to aim for when developing twins; not all 
twins need to involve real-time data at large 
volumes and complex predictive models.
We can also look at digital twins not 
in isolation, but as data and models 
that can be shared, connected and 
integrated, creating a whole greater than 
the sum of its parts, which has its own 
set of challenges. Data sharing between 
organisations is often done on an ad 
hoc basis, through data requests, hack 
events and even email. This level of data 
sharing is not enough to organically 
support a set of connected twins.
ODI research 
43
 has highlighted a number 
of barriers to increasing access to data 
in the private sector, which touch on 
a range of cultural, commercial, legal 
and technical barriers. There are high 
barriers to entry in choosing a digital twins 
approach, due to the scale of digital twins 
projects. Data infrastructure is created by 
many partners who need to collaborate 
on sharing data, requiring a level of 
trust. ODI research 
44
 found that trust is a 
crucial lever for increasing data sharing. 
To share data openly, organisations will 
need to trust the institutions they are 
sharing data with and data users need 
to know whether to use data from it.

Where could new data-
access approaches help?
For many of the challenges detailed in this 
paper, in particular in regard to connecting 
digital twins, a data institution may be able 
to help by stewarding accessible, readable, 
trusted data from across different sectors. 
There has already been movement towards 
these goals; the CDBB are working on 
standards and an information-management 
network to support access to data for 
the National Digital Twin programme. 
45
One role that a data institution could take 
would be in maintaining a set of shared 
data assets that act as reference data 
libraries containing sector-by-sector 
reference data. These data libraries would 
be stewarded on a sector-by-sector basis, 
as each sector will have a bespoke set of 
reference data. The UK is a sector-siloed 
nation and data sharing will be, at least 
initially, more coherent within sectors 
than across them. There are examples of 
these organisations that already exist and 
are actively stewarding data for different 
sectors, such as Xoserve, 
46
 the Central 
Data Service Provider for Great Britain’s 
gas market and Smart DCC, which has 
‘built and maintained the secure national 
infrastructure that underpins the roll out 
of smart meters across Great Britain’. 
47
Crucially, these libraries need to be 
aligned around common standards to 
ensure they are interoperable and reusable 
across a larger connected ecosystem of 
digital twins across sectors. Sharing data 
across sectors is a prerequisite for the 
success of digital twins. An organisation 
in each sector, charged with managing the 
repository of shared data and associated 
metadata, would provide a simple way 
of sharing and communicating between 
sectors. Some organisations are already 
moving forward in this space, the Data and 
Analytics Facility for National Infrastructure 
(DAFNI) 
48
 is building a platform that will 
support the development of essential 
UK infrastructure by providing a central 
point for data, modelling and visualisation 
with data from across sectors.

Final thoughts
Data needs to be at the right point on the data spectrum. 
Data has the potential to help us tackle a variety of 
social, environmental and economic problems. Solving 
the biggest challenges requires sharing data not 
just within organisations, but between partners and 
across sectors. This requires investment in the data 
infrastructure that can help us to use data well.
It is not enough to focus on the purely 
technical aspects of data infrastructure, 
we must also develop the policies 
and guidance that govern how data is 
being accessed, used and shared. This 
will ensure equitable access to data 
and minimise harms from its use.
In this paper we have outlined three 
approaches for sharing data that are 
already being successfully applied in other 
sectors. We have also briefly explored 
how these approaches might apply to 
support the operations of smart buildings 
and delivering on the promise of digital 
twins. Choosing the right approaches for 
sharing data and deciding on what data 
infrastructure needs to be built depends on 
the problems and challenges to be solved. 
Sometimes, what is needed is a cross-
sector initiative to develop open standards 
and support their adoption and use. In 
other cases, to pool data from multiple 
organisations or to manage shared data 
assets, what might be needed are new data 
institutions that can provide independent 
stewardship around that shared data.
More work is needed to understand the 
right mix of approaches for smart buildings, 
digital twins and other areas of the built 
environment. What is common is the 
importance of openness and collaboration.
Our manifesto for sharing engineering 
data provided a framework for thinking 
about how to drive open, data-enabled 
innovation in the built environment 
sector. But the next steps require more 
practical work. There is a need for pilots, 
prototypes and open innovation.
Through our data institutions programme, 
49
 
we look forward to working with our 
members, our partners like Arup and 
the Lloyd’s Register Foundation to 
explore how best to increase access 
to data in the built environment.

manifesto, share your insights from
