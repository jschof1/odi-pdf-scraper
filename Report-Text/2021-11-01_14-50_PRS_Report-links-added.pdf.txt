POOR HEALTH CAN HAVE ENVIRONMENTAL ROOTS
¡Health and wellbeing are influenced by a range of social and environmental factors:
¡Social prescriptioninvolves linking patients with non-medical community-based 
sources of support (egsports or social activities). This linkage can involve dedicated 
link workers as well as referrals by local authorities and other organisations. The NHS 
Long Term Plan (2019) commits to introducing over ‘1000 new trained social 
prescribing link workers in primary care networks by 2020/21, rising further so that by 
2023/24, over 900,000 people will be referred to social prescribing.’
¡NHS England and NHS Improvement (2021 A) noted that while ‘there is a need for more 
robust and systematic evidence on the effectiveness of social prescribing, social 
prescribing schemes may lead to a reduction in the use of NHS services, including GP 
attendance’.

IMPACTS
SOCIAL PRESCRIBING COULD REDUCE NON-CLINICAL GP APPOINTMENTS
¡If GP appointments fall by 2-5% as a result of social prescribing operating at scale, it could lead to a diversion of between 3.2-8 million GP 
appointments per year. Social prescribing’s actual impact on GP appointment volumes is uncertain and further research is needed.GPs 
could use the additional capacity to see other patients with pressing clinical needs. Further work is needed to quantify the costs of 
replacing GP appointments with community provision.
¡As well as freeing up resources the users could receive more appropriate support provided the quality of community offerings was
sufficiently high. Delivering a high-quality experience helps to ensure social prescribing is a sustainable alternative to clinical care.

DATA IS FUNDAMENTAL TO SOCIAL PRESCRIBING

AN UNDERSTANDING OF DEMAND AND SUPPLY IS CRITICAL
WE HAVE CREATED A UNIQUE COLLECTION OF DEMAND SIDE DATA
¡We have drawn together data on several topics:
¡These datasets provide information on the incidence of issues which could drive demand for social prescribing. We have used the combined 
dataset to create an open and interactive map of potential demand. This can be used to plan local services.

HIGH-QUALIT Y DATA INFRASTRUCTURE IS A NECESSARY BUT NOT SUFFICIENT CONDITION FOR SOCIAL PRESCRIBING TO BE EFFECTIVE
¡Social prescribing can unlock benefits if enablers are in place. One requirement for social prescribing is data infrastructure, such as standards 
and stewardship to ensure appropriate information is collected and shared. Other enablers must also be in place. Community providers need 
support to deal with extra demand and social prescribing needs to operate within an adequately funded mental and physical healthsystem.

frontiereconomics
FURTHER INVESTMENT IS NEEDED IN DATA INFRASTRUCTURE 
5
¡There are currently significant gaps in the data infrastructure for social prescribing. Mostly notably, we have highlighted barriers to the 
collection and sharing of data related to the supply of relevant activities and longitudinal data on impact. These gaps are caused by a range of 
‘market failures’:
The hyper-local nature of service provision creates a coordination problem and can lead to multiple duplicative service directories.
Community groups and activity providers may not have an obvious route to share information on platforms.
Some service providers may have little incentive to maintain and share good data on their offerings. 
Increased focus on social prescribing in recent years means that the data ecosystem is still nascent and trust is still developing.
¡Taken together, these issues may mean that link workers do not know where to signpost potential users, or rely on incomplete information. 
This could lead to service users being prescribed activities which are not perfectly tailored to their individual needs, which in turn may reduce 
the chances of the referral being successful and generating desired impacts. There are initiatives in development or currently underway that 
will go some way to addressing these challenges. These include Open Referral UK, the Social Prescribing Observatory, OpenActive and 
prescribing.social.
¡However, further investment and intervention in this context is needed. We have highlighted possible interventions which could help to fill 
these gaps including: (1) Improving understanding of stakeholders’ roles in the development of data infrastructure. (2) Providing incentives to 
make information on offerings open. (3) Developing improved data infrastructure directly (egimproved IT systems and standards) which 
make it easier to make data open. (4) Requiring organisations to make some data in the public interest open. This investment could in some 
cases itself also unlock savings (egremoval of duplicated directories of services).

BACKGROUND

frontiereconomics8
SOCIAL PRESCRIBING CAN ADDRESS ENVIRONMENTAL CAUSES OF ILL HEALTH
SOCIAL PRESCRIBING IS A KEY COMPONENT OF UNIVERSAL PERSONALISED CARE 
¡Wellbeing is influenced by environmental factors. Social prescribing can address 
determinants of health by linking patients with non-medical support. Social 
prescribing link workers connect people to community support which helps 
people deal with underlying causes of ill health. Social prescriptions include 
activities focused on health, physical activity and sport as well as leisure/art. The 
NHS Long Term Plan (2019) commits to introducing ‘over 1000 new trained social 
prescribing link workers in primary care networks by 2020/21, rising further so 
that by 2023/24, over 900,000 people will be referred to social prescribing’. Social 
prescribing may also involve referrals by local authorities and self-referral.  
¡Those who could benefit from social prescription include people with complex 
needs, the socially isolated and those who frequently attend health care settings. 
Greater signposting and usage of community services could also benefit large 
numbers of individuals who do not fall into these groups.
¡NHS England and NHS Improvement (2021 A) noted that while ‘there is a need for 
more robust and systematic evidence on the effectiveness of social prescribing, 
social prescribing schemes may lead to a reduction in the use of NHS services, 
including GP attendance’. More information is needed on these impacts and how 
they are achieved.
“
Social prescribing is a way for local agencies to refer people 
to a link worker. Link workers give people time, focusing on 
‘what matters to me’ and connect people to community 
groups and services for practical and emotional support.

SOCIAL PRESCRIBING CAN OPERATE IN A NUMBER OF WAYS
¡The formal social prescribing process we have described above is the core focus of this report. However, greater use of community services as 
an alternative to clinical treatment can also operate in more informal ways such as via greater signposting. This broader type of community 
referral may be relevant for large numbers of individuals as opposed to those who are most in need of community support.

THE HEALTH SYSTEM IS UNDER PRESSURE
AND PLACED A STRAIN ON THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM 
¡Since the start of the pandemic, the number of people waiting for 
NHS treatment in England has grown by a fifth and is expected to 
rise much further (IFS, 2021). 
¡Median wait time for planned NHS care in England rose sharply at 
the start of the pandemic and remains elevated. 
¡A significant proportion of patients avoided booking a GP 
appointment in 2020 due to fear of overburdening the NHS (Ipsos 
MORI GP Patient Survey, 2021). 
COVID-19 HAS NEGATIVELY IMPACTED PHYSICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH...
¡COVID-19 has led to excess deaths and contributed to increases in 
mortality (ONS, 2021 A). The pandemic has also severely affected 
mental health (UK Parliament POST, 2021). 
¡Over a third of British adults’ wellbeing is still being affected by 
the pandemic (ONS, 2021 B). Young adults, women and those with 
an existing mental health condition have been particularly hard 
hit. In late 2020, 25% of adults reported feeling lonely in the 
previous two weeks (Mental Health Foundation, 2020).

SOCIAL PRESCRIBING CAN BOOST EFFICIENCY OF HEALTHCARE  SPEND 
SOCIAL PRESCRIBING HAS THE POTENTIAL TO REDUCE DEMAND FOR CLINICAL PRIMARY CARE
¡In the future, current pressures on GPs may increase further. If unchecked, this could lead to significant unmet need for clinical primary care. 
Social prescribing has the potential to help avoid this.  
BEFORE SOCIAL PRESCRIBING
Patients’ clinical needs                            Patients’ non-clinical needs
AFTER SOCIAL PRESCRIBING
With no social prescribing, 
GP appointments reflect a 
mix of clinical and non-
clinical needs 
Following rollout of 
effective social prescribing, 
non-clinical needs are dealt 
with via community 
provision. This can result in 
lower healthcare costs as 
service users utilise cheaper 
services. Also clinical 
capacity can be freed-up

SCOPE
SCALE OF SOCIAL 
PRESCRIBING
SIZE OF IMPACT 
We have only quantified one specific aspect of social prescribing’s potential benefit. Our choice was informed 
by availability of underlying evidence. However, in the future, social prescribing could improve users’ 
wellbeing, reduce secondary care usage and lead to long-term economic benefits that we have not attempted 
to measure. Our limited focus will understate potential benefits. We have only modelled primary care 
appointments which involved engagement with a GP (rather than other practice staff).
Our modelling looks at the total ‘size of the prize’ in terms of avoidable GP appointments that social 
prescribing can help unlock, provided social prescribing is rolled out across the country at higher volumes 
than is currently the case. Achieving these benefits will therefore require substantial investment in enabling 
factors (egdata infrastructure) and also investment in community and voluntary groups to increase capacity 
to deliver specific activities. Further work is needed to quantify the costs of replacing GP appointments with 
community provision.
We have used available evidence to suggest a range of impact estimates which relate to social prescribing’s 
possible future effect on non-clinical GP appointments. However, a lack of high-quality, comprehensive, 
national data means that we cannot at this stage calculate a precise impact estimate. Social prescribing’s 
actual impact on GP appointment volumes is uncertain and further research is needed.

VOLUME OF ENGLISH GP APPOINTMENTS 
¡In 2019 there were approximately 312 
million primary care appointments in 
England. 162 million of these appointments 
involved consultation with a GP (the 
remainder involved engagement with other 
practice staff).
¡During the first lockdown period (March 
2020) appointments initially fell sharply. 
¡Appointments during the first half of 2021 
(excluding COVID-19 vaccination 
appointments) are comparable to the first 
half of 2019.

SOCIAL PRESCRIBING CAN FREE UP GP APPOINTMENTS
¡If GP appointments fall by 2-5% as a result of social prescribing operating at scale, it could lead to a diversion of between 3.2-8 million GP 
appointments per year. 
¡Social prescribing’s actual impact on GP appointment volumes is uncertain and further research on this topic is needed. GPs could use the 
additional capacity to see other patients with pressing clinical needs (see next page). Further empirical work is needed to quantify the costs of 
replacing GP appointments with community provision. 
¡The impacted patients with non-clinical needs could receive more appropriate support, provided community offerings were sufficiently high-
quality. Delivering a quality experience helps social prescribing become a sustainable alternative to clinical care.
POTENTIAL FUTURE VOLUMES 
¡Pressures on GPs are likely to increase further in the future. Analysis by the BMA (2021) has shown that since 2015, the averagenumber of 
patients per practice has increased by 24% whilst the number of GPs has been falling. An ageing population may also raise demandfor primary 
care services over the longer term.

SOCIAL PRESCRIBING COULD UNLOCK GP RESOURCES

frontiereconomics
23
THERE IS SOME EVIDENCE OF UNMET NEED FOR GP CONSULTATIONS 
IF SOCIAL PRESCRIBING REDUCES THE VOLUME OF NON-CLINICAL GP APPOINTMENTS, THE RESULTING CAPACIT Y COULD BE TARGETED ELSEWHERE
¡Evidence from the GP Patient Survey (Ipsos MORI, 2021) shows that in certain areas of the country there may be substantial unmetneed for 
primary care. Data is available for each clinical commissioning group (CCG) area. We can see considerable variation. In some areas, over 20% of 
respondents reported a poor experience booking an appointment or avoided booking altogether due to fears of overburdening theNHS.
¡Social prescribing can help to reduce demand for non-clinical GP appointments and therefore free up clinical time and resource which can be 
deployed elsewhere. If this extra capacity can be targeted at areas/social groups where unmet need may be most significant, it can help to 
contribute to quicker clinical diagnoses and ultimately to improvements in patients’ health. This will only be the case if social prescribing is an 
effective substitute for traditional primary care. Data collection and sharing is therefore essential to assess the quality and effectiveness of 
social prescribing.

MANY FACTORS WILL INFLUENCE DEMAND FOR SOCIAL PRESCRIBING
NUMEROUS LOCAL FACTORS WILL BE RELEVANT
¡The last decade has seen an increasing emphasis placed on the 
wider determinants of health. These conditions are influenced 
by a huge number of factors that will all vary significantly, both 
between different local areas and within each specific local area.
¡Social prescribing involves focusing on what matters to a 
specific individual. This will be related to a range of 
interconnected factors including mental health, housing or 
employment. Building up a picture of these factors within 
granular geographic areas can inform likely patterns of demand.
NUMEROUS POTENTIALLY RELEVANT DATASETS EXISTS
¡A wide array of potentially relevant demand-side information 
sources exist. This includes information published by PHE, Sport 
England, NHS England and NHS Improvement, ONS, Defra, 
MHCLG, and DWP.
¡All of these sources will be updated at different times and will 
differ in terms of their geographical scope and boundaries used. 
¡Existing demand-side data may not be used effectively currently 
as it is not always accessible or available at an appropriate level 
of granularity.

DEMAND SIDE DATA 
KEY 
TAKEAWAY
Managers and policymakers in the health system 
need to build up a detailed understanding of 
issues that will create demand for social 
prescribing in different parts of the country.
KEY 
TAKEAWAY
Dedicated resources will need to be invested in 
order to gather and steward the local area 
‘demand’ data that can inform social prescribing 
requirements.

WE HAVE COLLECTED A RANGE OF DEMAND-SIDE DATA FOR SOCIAL PRESCRIBING 
¡We have drawn together datasets that provide information on the incidence of issues which could drive demand for social prescribing. The 
data includes demographic data for context. For example, deprivation data is included as it is correlated with negative health outcomes.
¡The data covers six domains. Example metrics under each domain are provide below:  
DEMAND-SIDE DATA 

frontiereconomics
WE HAVE PRODUCED AN INTERACTIVE DEMAND TOOL WITH THIS DATA
30
§We have used the combined dataset to create an interactive map 
of potential demand. Users can select a measure that they are 
interested in and the data will be mapped across England, 
showing geographical variation. This tool is intended to 
demonstrate the value of combining data related to social 
prescribing in one place, facilitated by existing open data. 
§For example, in the map on the right, we have illustrated how 
the tool can highlight geographic variation in loneliness across 
the country. At this stage the map is a proof-of-concept type 
tool, facilitated by existing open data, but not yet a finished 
product. In future, the tool could include more open demand 
data, more granular data and supply data.
§The underlying data behind the interactive map is freely 
available here.In line with the ODI’s mission we want others to 
investigate this data, highlight specific features which are most 
helpful and link the information provided to other datasets to 
facilitate the creation of new insights. This allows others to 
explore the data in different ways and to combine it with other 
data to gain additional insight.

THIS TOOL HAS A NUMBER OF USE CASES
31
THIS COLLECTION OF DATA IS UNIQUE AND OFFERS SEVERAL ADVANTAGES 
¡Comprehensive coverage across the country:the metrics collected cover all of England which means that each locality can be examined individually 
and compared against other benchmark areas such as local neighbours. 
¡Broad range of potential factors included: inclusion of metrics from six domains allows for the simultaneous exploration of multiple indicators. Users 
can identify links between factors such as deprivation, mental health and physical activity. Previously comparing these metrics in a consistent format 
was a challenge as different data sources adopt different geographical units of analysis. For example, NHS England and NHS Improvement data is often 
reported at the Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG) or Integrated Care System (ICS) level which does not map to other forms ofdata published at the 
local authority level. 
¡Provides solid foundation: in the future, this dataset could be combined with nationwide supply-side data to highlight gaps where demand for social 
prescribing is high, but the volume of relevant services is low.
THIS DATABASE CAN SUPPORT SEVERAL USE CASES
¡Planning services: having this collection of data made available in an accessible format for the first time may allow central government, local 
authorities, charities and link workers to coordinate better in the planning and deployment of services around the country.
¡Identification of target areas for intervention. Policymakers can identify where more social prescribing would have most impact.
¡Predicting future demand: this data can be used to consider potential future needs and identify and highlight interesting patterns, such as localities of 
possible best practice
DEMAND-SIDE DATA 

frontiereconomics
MAPPING THE AVAILABILIT Y OF LOCAL SERVICES IS DIFFICULT
LOCAL DATA ON AVAILABILIT Y OF SERVICES IS INCONSISTENT 
¡Generating comprehensive information on supply of activities within a local authority is a major challenge. Local Authorities, health and 
voluntary sector organisations maintain separate directories of locally available services (there are also multiple other sources of potentially 
useful supply-side information from charities or learning providers). This leads to duplication of effort and creates issues with 
interoperability (Snook, 2019). 
¡Multiple community service directories exist in each local area due to a lack of trust between organisations. This limits data sharing (Digital 
Gaps and Porism, 2021). Local Authorities are required to run a Family Information Service, which provides information on children and 
parent services and outlines their local offer, which gives information on the services for young people with special educational needs. Some 
Local Authorities provide accessible and wide-ranging directories of services, while others are difficult to locate and/or fragmented. 
¡Information is not always provided on how regularly directories are updated. In some cases these types of databases are created via pilot 
projects and then there is no budget to maintain the information to a high standard. This in turn undermines trust. 
¡Link workers may be reluctant to refer potential services users to activities they are not familiar with. Currently a lack ofinformation on 
attendance/user satisfaction and challenges means that link workers may have to invest time exploring the suitability of a new offering.
32
SUPPLY-SIDE DATA 
KEY 
TAKEAWAY
Link workers might not know where to signpost potential users, or may rely on old or incomplete information. This could 
lead to service users being prescribed activities which are not perfectly tailored to their individual needs, which in turn may 
reduce the chances of the referral being successful and generating desired impacts. 

frontiereconomics
RECORDING VOLUMES OF SOCIAL PRESCRIBING IS CHALLENGING 
DATA ON DELIVERY OF SOCIAL PRESCRIBING HAS ITS OWN CHALLENGES 
¡Dayson and Leather (2020) found consistency and recording issues with the data collected in GP practices, meaning it could beunsuitable 
for assessing social prescribing activities. PHE also highlighted issues around data collection (Mason et al. 2019), including patient 
difficulties with completing questionnaires, and problems with the type of data recorded by GP practices.   
¡Martin Bell Partnership (2021) reviewed the digital landscape for social prescribing and found that data collection is still predominantly 
paper-based, supplemented by local and fragmented digital databases. Jani et al. (2020b) highlighted barriers to evidence generation, 
including little standardisation in data collection, inadequate code lists and variation in recording by clinicians.
¡Data that is currently collected and published may not always be sufficiently granular to provide nuanced insights. For example,in the 
future it would be helpful to break down this data on referrals and declines by including the outcome of the social prescribing intervention. 
33
SUPPLY-SIDE DATA 
KEY 
TAKEAWAY
The lack of standardisation in data collection and monitoring of attendance makes it difficult to assess the effectiveness of
social prescribing and/or the quality of specific activities at a large scale.

POLICY IMPLICATIONS 

frontiereconomics
EFFORTS ARE UNDERWAY TO IMPROVE THE DATA LANDSCAPE
THERE ARE PROMISING SIGNS THAT THE DATA LANDSCAPE IS IMPROVING 
¡Investment has been made in recent years to address some of the data infrastructure issues we have highlighted. For example, theProfessional Record Standards Body 
(2021) is working with a range of stakeholders including link workers, GPs, NHS project managers, counsellors, and service usersto develop a social prescribing standard 
which will help ensure information from sessions can be shared with care providers to identify people who would benefit from social prescribing and help health services 
nationally improve social prescribing. Also the NHS Personalised Care Digital Programme (2021) has produced a social support pack to help commissioners considering the 
purchase of a social prescribing digital case management system and collated a set of accredited suppliers for social prescribing solutions. We have included other specific 
examples below which are not comprehensive but illustrate some of the types of data improvement efforts that exist in this space. 
35
OPEN REFERRAL UK
¡The Open Referral UK data standard 
is a consistent way of recording and 
sharing information about services. 
¡Open Referral UK defines a standard 
structure which can help to avoid 
some of the duplication associated 
with multiple competing service 
directories. 
¡This initiative brings together local 
councils, voluntary bodies, funders 
and technologists to publish and use 
resource directory information more 
easily.
SOCIAL PRESCRIBING OBSERVATORY
¡The Royal College of General 
Practitioners, Nuffield Department of 
Primary Care Health Science and the 
University of Oxford established the 
Social Prescribing Observatory in 
collaboration with NHS England and 
NHS Improvement. 
¡The Social Prescribing Observatory 
provides information on social 
prescribing referrals and declines for 
each integrated care system. The 
same group also captures 
information on actual activities 
prescribed.
OPENACTIVE
¡The ODI and Sport England are 
working together to improve and 
open up information about physical 
activity and sporting opportunities 
across England. Prior to this work 
much of the information about 
activities was inaccessible (stored on 
old-fashioned websites, or printed 
material). 
¡OpenActive provides open data on 
sports/fitness-related activities 
across the UK and also includes data 
standards, tools, and support to help 
people find and book activities.
PRESCRIBING.SOCIAL
¡prescribing.social is a crowd-sourced 
resource for voluntary/community 
social enterprise organisations to 
upload information about their 
organisation and services. This could 
allow primary care staff to find 
information on all the different 
providers in the same place. 
¡The directory currently includes 
publicly available information form 
the Charity Commission data. VCSE 
organisations can complete a form to 
add their offering to the site.

frontiereconomics
Hyper-local nature of service 
provision leads to lack of 
central coordination and 
creates multiple competing 
service directories.
BARRIERS TO 
EFFECTIVE SUPPLY 
SIDE DATA 
INFRASTRUCTURE
Community groups and activity 
providers may not have a obvious route 
to share information on platforms. 
Information may be recorded on old 
systems which may not be 
interoperable.
Data quality is a key challenge. Some 
service providers may have little 
incentive to maintain and share good 
data on their offerings. Maintaining 
comprehensive service directories 
requires sustained funding.
Increased focus on social 
prescribing in recent years 
means that the data ecosystem 
is still nascent and trust is still 
developing.

RECOMMENDATIONS

frontiereconomics38
THERE ARE SEVERAL LEVERS THAT COULD BE CONSIDERED
RECOMMENDED POLICY INTERVENTIONS 
1.Improve understanding of stakeholders’ roles in the development of data infrastructure. Example: Charities, community 
groups and NHS England and NHS Improvement emphasise the roles of individuals/groups in ensuring information flows 
effectively and is maintained to a high standard. Previous work has highlighted that specific social prescribing initiatives 
were not widely promoted, which limited awareness (Digital Gaps and Porism, 2021) . 
2.Consider whether activity providers and those who compile directories could be provided with a direct incentive to make 
information on offerings open. In many cases, link workers struggle to find suitable activities (Digital Gaps and Porism, 
2021). Example: Make local government funding for community groups/information holders contingent on up-to-date 
information on offerings. 
3.Develop improved data infrastructure directly (egimproved IT systems and standards) which mean it is easier to make data 
open. This could make it easy for service providers to directly update information on their own offerings on existing 
platforms. Example: Provision of support for the development and adoption of open standards. For example Local 
Authorities and activity providers could be required to adopt the Open Referral UK standard. This would allow multiple 
portals to ingest information on activity providers’ updated offerings. In other cases, social-prescribing standards 
compliance could be made a requirement in NHS procurement. Government could also work to identify a clear group of data 
owners and fund ongoing data stewardship. 
4.Require organisations to make some data in the public interest open. Example: Local Authorities could be required to make 
data on their service provision open in an integrated and comprehensive format.
