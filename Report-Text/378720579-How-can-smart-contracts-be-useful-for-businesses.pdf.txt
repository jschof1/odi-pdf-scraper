Executive summary 
Smart contracts and distributed ledgers might be useful 
for enabling efficient, trusted interactions, but it all 
depends on context and design. 
All daily interactions between people, businesses and other organisations are 
underpinned by trust – each party trusts that the other will behave in a certain way. 
Trust is therefore central to the functioning of society and the economy. Technology 
has long played a part in informing trust in interactions, particularly in recent 
decades. The latest set of emerging technologies that have been mooted as having 
the potential to play a role are distributed ledgers and, in particular, smart contracts. 
In this report, we examine the potential of distributed ledger technologies to inform 
trust, focusing on the role of smart contracts.  
 
Part 1 examines the potential of distributed ledgers and smart contracts to underpin 
trust within interactions. Our goal in Part 1 is to provide crucial information about 
these technologies and raise important questions about their benefits and limitations, 
in order to help businesses ask some of the right questions when attempting to 
decide whether distributed ledgers and smart contracts can be deployed within their 
business to solve real-world problems. 
 
Part 2 explores the various ways in which distributed ledgers and smart contracts 
can be deployed depending on the use case, industry context and the needs of the 
various parties involved. Our goal in Part 2 is to help businesses that are keen to 
pursue smart contracts define the type of system that will prove most beneficial for 
their business and their clients.  
 
 
Part 1: Are smart contracts useful for me and my business? 
 
The original blockchain was designed to enable financial transactions without the 
need for any trusted third party. The design of the system relies on storing records of 
all transactions on a new kind of database, with a unique set of properties, that 
engender trust between members of the network in those transactions. In particular, 
this trust resides in the distributed nature of the database – with every member of the 
peer network having a copy of the blockchain and equal authority to add to it. With 
no central copy, every member of the network, or node, can add to the database, 
though they must reach consensus before doing so – a process typically handled 
through the use of cryptography and economic incentive. Blockchain databases can 
be public, so anyone can join, or can have restricted permissions to read or write to 
the database, depending on the design chosen. 
 
Distributed ledgers such as these can arguably underpin trusted exchange of 
cryptocurrencies or other financial assets in the absence of trusted third parties 
rather effectively. However, many people are excited by their potential application to 
other use cases – typically using the immutable and distributed nature of the 
database to create a verifiable, single, trusted record of particular events. This can 
open up the possibility of answering some of the challenges that cannot be solved 
with a centralised database – primarily because businesses would no longer need to 
trust a single third party to operate the system or database. Examples of how 
distributed ledgers could be applied include creating a single register for art and 
collectibles (Codex protocol), guaranteeing the integrity of digital archives 
(ARCHANGEL) or managing digital music rights (Blokur). 
 
When asked to identify the most promising use cases for distributed ledgers and 
smart contracts, many of the people we spoke to immediately reached for the 
 
Open Data Institute 2018 / Technical reportHow can smart contracts be useful for businesses?   3 

 
 
example of supply chains – primarily looking at distributed ledgers and smart 
contracts as a way to solve insidious supply chain issues such as sustainability, 
counterfeiting and child labour. The idea is that creating a single, transparent, 
authoritative, immutable ledger of goods moving through a supply chain, which all 
members of that supply chain can trust, might help to track the provenance of goods. 
Examples of companies attempting to tackle these issues using distributed ledgers 
include Everledger, who aim to certify the provenance of high-value assets such as 
diamonds, and arc-net, who aim to trace goods from source through production 
to consumer. 
 
Smart contacts offer an extension of distributed ledgers, providing the means to 
automate processes within the database while retaining characteristics of distributed 
ledger technologies, especially around immutability and the creation of trust. A smart 
contract is a piece of executable computer code stored on a distributed ledger that, 
when certain conditions are met, can automatically modify data on that ledger. 
Smart contracts potentially offer a way to enable transparent, auditable and efficient 
interactions between people, businesses and governments – especially in complex 
networks or industries with many different players where using a trusted central 
authority or marketplace to approve, administer and record the interactions 
is difficult. 
 
Again, the use case for supply chains can help detail the potential of smart contracts, 
especially when it comes to automating processes around things like certification and 
authenticity. Examples of companies attempting to tackle these issues include 
Provenance, who are using smart contracts to automate verification of certification, 
and Sweetbridge, who aim to use smart contracts to automatically trigger 
work orders.  
 
There are places where smart contracts and distributed ledgers might be useful in 
tackling business problems, but businesses need to identify a clear use case where 
there is lack of trust between multiple actors and no central authority is trusted to 
administer the entire system. 
 
 
Part 2: what type of smart contract system should I pursue? 
 
Once a problem has been clearly defined, and there is the possibility that smart 
contracts and distributed ledgers might be useful, then businesses will need to 
design an approach which takes into account not only the features and limitations of 
the technology, but the features and limitations of the industry or system in which the 
problem exists. We identified three key challenges that businesses need to consider 
and decide how to tackle. Businesses will need to: 
 
i) Identify how to ensure that data gets into the ledger in a trustworthy manner 
 
Almost all use cases for smart contracts rely on external data in order to 
execute their terms. That external data must be written to the ledger in a way 
that all members of the network can trust, otherwise the smart contracts are 
unlikely to be useful.  
 
ii) Identify how to deal with edge cases and resolve disputes 
 
Regardless of how well smart contracts are implemented, there will always 
be errors and bugs in code. This means there will likely be edge cases where 
smart contract execution will result in disputes, which will need to be 
resolved to the satisfaction of most members of the network if they are to 
trust the system.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
Open Data Institute 2018 / Technical reportHow can smart contracts be useful for businesses?   4 

 
 
iii) Identify how the system will be funded and governed, and how value will be 
transferred  
 
All technology systems and business processes create setup and operational 
costs. How these costs are administered and by whom will have a big impact 
on not only trust in the system but incentive to participate. 
 
 
Businesses need to make decisions about the extent to which they can use the 
technology and the extent to which they can use existing industry mechanisms to 
tackle these three challenges. In this choice between idealism and pragmatism is the 
implicit challenge of designing solutions that fit the needs of the business and the 
industry without losing all the potential benefits of this technological approach. Such 
a balance is difficult, and businesses need to be mindful about the different 
approaches that can be taken. Given the reliance on industry context, many systems 
will require different approaches in response to different challenges, and often these 
will be a mixture of the ideal and pragmatic. 
 
 
Key takeaways 
Daily interactions between people, businesses, and other organisations are 
all underpinned by trust.  
 
Distributed ledgers are an emerging set of database technologies that have 
the potential to play a part in informing this trust – using their unique 
properties of immutability and distributed maintenance to create a verifiable, 
single, trusted record of particular events. 
 
Smart contracts are pieces of executable computer code stored on a 
distributed ledger that, when certain conditions are met, can automatically 
modify data on that ledger – potentially providing the means to automate 
different processes within the database. 
 
Distributed ledgers and smart contracts are potentially useful for businesses 
but only if there is a clearly defined use case where there is lack of trust 
between multiple actors and no central authority is trusted to administer the 
entire system.  
 
Having identified a clear use case, businesses looking to implement 
distributed ledger and smart contract approaches to tackle challenges need 
to remain pragmatic about the capabilities of the technology and the existing 
industry context.  
 
Specifically, businesses should be prepared to make decisions about: 
 
i) how to get data into the ledger in a trustworthy manner 
ii) how to handle edge cases and resolve disputes 
iii) how to fund, govern and administer the system effectively

About this report 
In 2016, the Open Data Institute (ODI) carried out research into the application of 
blockchain and distributed ledger technologies, publishing the results in ‘​Applying 
blockchain technology in global data infrastructure​’. In that report, we examined the 
basics of blockchains and distributed ledger technologies, potential use cases and 
applications beyond FinTech, and some of the challenges facing those attempting to 
tackle problems using these technologies. Our goal was to help business leaders and 
policymakers make informed decisions around their adoption of these 
new technologies. 
 
Since we released that report, blockchain and distributed ledger technologies have 
continued to develop at a rapid rate. More tools and technologies have become 
available, and more companies and organisations have begun to develop products 
and services. As these technologies appear to grow more mature, interest from 
businesses about applying them to real-world problems grows too. The main 
challenge for businesses is identifying whether the problem they are trying to tackle 
requires, or would benefit from, the application of distributed ledger technologies. In 
this report we move beyond the potential challenges raised in our first report by 
focusing specifically on smart contracts and the role they might play in informing trust 
between people and organisations. 
 
As with our previous report, we have primarily focused on the potential of distributed 
ledgers outside the finance sector, because the financial services industry is already 
heavily invested in potential applications in their industry. Our goal is to provide an 
overview of the potential for businesses in other sectors, and for cases that go 
beyond support for cryptocurrencies. To support this approach, we have used a 
single prominent use – supply chains – as a frame of reference to highlight not only 
potential applications of distributed ledgers and smart contracts but also three of the 
main challenges businesses will face when attempting to implement such systems. 
 
Even with recent developments, it is perhaps still too early to pass judgement on 
individual technologies and applications. In this report, as with our last one, we 
instead raise the questions about which we think companies should be aware. It is 
our hope that by raising these questions we can provide businesses with a critical 
lens to evaluate the value of these technologies in their specific use cases.

Part 1: Smart contracts and 
uses for business 
Interactions between people, businesses and other 
organisations are underpinned by trust. This report 
examines what role, if any, smart contracts and 
distributed ledgers can play in informing this trust. 
Every day, billions of people, businesses and other organisations interact with one 
another – they make exchanges, enter into agreements and come to understandings. 
All these interactions are underpinned by trust – each party expects and trusts that 
the other will behave in a certain expected way, following a set of implicit or explicit 
rules. Trust is central to the functioning of society and the economy; without it, 
businesses, governments and people lack the confidence to meaningfully interact. 
 
In modern societies and economies, trust is informed by a wide range of different 
factors and derived from a variety of different sources. The rule of law, protections of 
regulators, economic incentives, reputation and brand recognition, and many others, 
all contribute to the trust we place in certain interactions. The sources we rely on, and 
the extent to which we rely on them, depend on the type of interaction. Relationships 
between large multinationals, for example, are more likely to be governed by trust in 
strict legal arrangements, whereas a consumer’s choice of a service provider is more 
likely underpinned by trust in the reputation of the brand. 
 
Technology has been one of these sources underpinning trust for a significant 
amount of time. For example, the creation of double-entry accounting and the 
printing press helped engender trust in trade in 14th-century Europe. Since the late 
1
20th century, digital and data technologies have been playing an increasingly large 
role in underpinning trust in transactions. For example, secure web browsing and 
antivirus software give us confidence while shopping or banking online. The goal of 
many of these technological innovations is to enable trusted transactions to occur 
more efficiently, often by making them faster and easier than existing processes. 
Lately, one set of emerging technologies that have been touted as having a potential 
role in informing trust are blockchains and distributed ledgers.  
 
Blockchains and distributed ledgers are emerging technologies that can be used to 
store, and in some cases manage, data. Data is essential for the modern age; it is 
infrastructure for the whole economy – and blockchain and distributed ledger 
technologies form part of our data infrastructure. Data infrastructure consists of data 
2
assets, the organisations that operate and maintain them, and guides describing how 
to use and manage the data. It includes people, processes and technology. As 
3
technologies that store data, it is important to understand what role blockchains and 
distributed ledgers might play in creating a robust data infrastructure.

In this report, we examine the potential application of blockchain and distributed 
ledger technologies to inform trust. In particular, we focus on the role of smart 
contracts – programmable and executable computer code stored on distributed 
ledgers that offer a means of codifying and automating complex interactions. Our aim 
is to offer neutral, unbiased advice to businesses to help them understand smart 
contracts and some of their potential applications. Some businesses may be 
exploring whether to begin building smart contract systems, whereas others may be 
deciding whether to join an existing system. This report is aimed at both audiences 
and we hope it will enable businesses to make informed decisions about using or 
investing in smart contracts as a solution to real-world problems. 
Blockchains, distributed ledgers and trust 
Blockchain emerged in response to a specific type of interaction use case – financial 
transactions. In traditional financial transactions, the exchange of value between any 
two parties, be they people or businesses, relies on one or more trusted third parties. 
The implicit third party in most transactions is a government or central bank that 
issues the currency used to exchange value. In most transactions, especially those 
between businesses, the parties will also rely on one or more other organisations to 
enact the transfer, for example the bank or banks with which they hold accounts. 
 
The original blockchain, the Bitcoin blockchain, was designed to enable financial 
transactions without the need for any trusted third party. Driven in large part by an 
ideological rejection of value exchange underpinned by state institutions, the idea 
was to provide a medium for parties to exchange and transact directly with one 
another. The design of the system relied on storing records of all Bitcoin transactions 
on a new kind of database, with a unique set of properties, that engendered trust in 
those transactions. 
 
In ​our previous report​, we outlined the unique set of properties of these new 
databases and explained how these properties arise from the design of the database. 
Below, we have provided a brief overview of the key properties of distributed ledgers 
that enable them to inform trust in transactions.  
 
Key properties of distributed ledgers 
These properties are drawn from Greenspan (2015) ‘Avoiding the pointless 
blockchain project’.

●Shared read:​ Blockchains are a structured data store that many 
people can read. 
●Shared write:​ As well as read, many people can write data into the 
database. 
●Absence of trust:​ The different writers do not have to trust each 
other not to manipulate the shared database state. 
●Disintermediation:​ There is no need for a trusted intermediary to 
enforce access control. 
●Transaction interaction:​ Records in the database depend on, and 
link to, each other. 
●Validation rules:​ Rules around database transactions are well 
defined, such that anyone with a copy of the database can validate 
that it has been maintained correctly.

Important characteristics of distributed ledgers 
 
Distributed ledgers have no central storage location, no ‘primary’ copy, but rather are 
maintained by a peer network of nodes; every node has a copy of the blockchain and 
has equal authority to add to it. In order to ensure that only one node may add a 
block to the end of the chain at any given time, blockchains need a resolution 
mechanism to decide which block is submitted to, and accepted by, the network.  
 
There are a number of different resolution mechanisms or ‘consensus algorithms’ 
that can be built into distributed ledgers. Choosing a consensus algorithm for a 
distributed ledger can greatly affect the scalability of the system – in particular 
determining the amount of energy and computing power required to support its 
operation. The current most common consensus algorithm is ‘Proof of Work’, used 
by both the Bitcoin blockchain and the Ethereum blockchain, although the 
well-documented high-energy usage has led many to explore alternative 
mechanisms. We have outlined several different types of consensus algorithm 
5
below. 
 
 
Consensus algorithms 
6
Each consensus algorithm determines which node gets to add its data to the 
database. The data being added is a combination of all the transactions 
submitted to the network over a given period.  
  
●Proof of work: ​nodes must compete to prove they have solved a 
complex cryptographic puzzle and are rewarded for doing so – a 
process referred to as ‘mining’ 
●Proof of stake: ​nodes must prove they own a certain amount of 
cryptocurrency; the more they own the more likely they are to be 
chosen to provide the next block – a process referred to as ‘validation’ 
●Proof of activity: ​nodes must first undergo a proof of work 
cryptography solution, which is then ‘validated’ through a proof of 
stake mechanism 
 
 
These consensus algorithms often offer incentives for nodes to participate in the 
process of creating a new block, often in the form of cryptocurrency. They rely on this 
incentive to encourage many nodes to participate in the process in order to help 
guarantee the integrity of the system. This approach is taken for many distributed 
ledgers that are public – anyone can view, participate in a transaction or run a node, 
such as the Bitcoin blockchain or the public Ethereum blockchain.  
 
However, recently there has been a trend towards creating networks that require 
permission to join. While they still operate consensus algorithms, the ‘rewards’ do not 
need to have economic value, assuming that those participating will choose to run a 
node. While these systems create permissions, and in some cases access may be 
determined by a single actor, there are still potential benefits in distributing the 
running of the system for creating trust between participants in that system.

Permissions 
7
Distributed ledgers can be classified by who has access to read and write to 
the database: 
 
●Public:​ anyone may have a copy of the database and anyone may 
write to it, sometimes referred to as ‘permissionless’ 
●Permissioned:​ Anyone may have a copy of the database, but only 
certain parties may write to it 
●Private:​ Only certain authorised users have access to the database, 
whether for reading or writing 
Trust beyond transactions 
When the first blockchain appeared in 2009, the ability of distributed ledgers to 
underpin cryptocurrency transactions in the absence of trusted third parties appealed 
to a variety of different people and organisations, in particular the finance industry. 
Soon after, other organisations and industries began to explore how the unique 
properties of this new technology could play a role beyond its immediately intended 
use case. In particular, there was interest in using the immutable and distributed 
nature of the database to create a verifiable, single, trusted record of particular 
events. The hope was that by attaching various other types of data to a particular 
transaction - eg time, location, quantity, ownership history - organisations could use 
the properties of distributed ledgers to create verifiable, timestamped records.  
 
Using distributed ledgers in this way made it possible to dream of applying the 
technology to a wide range of use cases beyond cryptocurrencies. From supporting 
the verification of the content of digital files to recording the ownership or transfer of 
assets that are not stored on the ledger, many have argued that distributed ledgers 
are capable of playing a role in underpinning trust in a variety of different use cases.  
 
Below is a small sample of the companies and projects using distributed ledgers to 
create verifiable records that underpin trust within their respective industry. 
 
 
Applications of distributed ledgers beyond cryptocurrencies 
 
Codex protocol 
8
Unlike most other asset classes, the art and collectibles market does not have 
a central title registry. This makes determining ownership of assets difficult. 
Records of past ownership are important to collectors as they help to prove 
the authenticity of an asset and its accurate valuation. Codex Labs have 
created the Codex Protocol Title Registry - an immutable, decentralised title 
registry that aims to engender trust around the origins of art and collectibles, 
and in turn create a fairer market for collectors. 
 
ARCHANGEL 
9
Archived documents, images and videos enable future generations to 
understand society as it exists today. However, as organisations continue to 
shift towards digital practices, discerning whether these files have been 
altered will become increasingly difficult. The ARCHANGEL project is 
exploring the use of distributed ledger technologies as a mechanism to verify 
that digitally archived files have not been modified. By storing cryptographic

hashes of the content of each file, the ARCHANGEL project aims to allow 
organisations to guarantee the integrity of archived content over time, and 
allow people to authenticate that content in an archive has not been changed 
beyond necessary format shifting. 
 
Blokur 
10
Music publishing can be complex. With songwriters, recording artists and 
record labels all playing a role in the production and publishing of songs, 
determining who the legal owner of a particular composition is can be 
difficult, even for the parties involved. Being able to determine legal 
ownership is important, as individuals and organisations receive royalty 
payments for both sales of an original composition and sales of any cover 
recordings based on that original song. Blokur are using distributed ledger 
technologies to create an immutable record for the ownership of music rights 
by sourcing data from music publishers and the collective management 
organisations that represent artists. Using machine learning algorithms, 
Blokur identifies and resolves discrepancies about ownership rights in this 
data, eliminating the need to involve expensive third parties. 
The supply chain use case 
In the last report, we determined that much of the excitement around distributed 
ledgers was focused on the technical capabilities of the technology and not on the 
problems that the technology might be used to solve. With this report we want to 
understand the promise of distributed ledgers and smart contracts in the context of a 
specific use case in order to interrogate their usefulness in practice.  
 
When asked to identify the most promising use cases for distributed ledgers and 
smart contracts, many of the people we spoke to in this space immediately reached 
for the example of managing supply chains. In particular, they focused on how smart 
contracts and distributed ledgers may play a role in connecting disparate members of 
a supply chain and helping to trace the movement of goods as they pass between 
members of that supply chain.  
 
Given the widespread interest in this use case, and the number of companies and 
initiatives trying to address this challenge, we chose to use it as a lens through which 
to examine the potential benefits and limitations of applying distributed ledgers and 
smart contracts to tackle real-world problems.  
 
Yet while the relevance of distributed ledgers and smart contracts to the supply chain 
use case is broadly agreed upon, companies attempting to implement distributed 
ledgers and smart contracts are taking a range of different approaches. This is in 
large part because the technology is still emerging and the platforms and technology 
stacks are not fully standardised. We therefore interviewed a number of companies 
about their approach to implementing smart contracts and distributed ledgers to 
tackle supply chain challenges. Our focus on the supply chain use case is not 
intended as an endorsement of the concept or of the companies interviewed; rather, 
we use the supply chain use case as a means of making the concepts discussed 
more concrete and tangible. 
 
Use case: supply chains 
 
Global supply chains delivering food, clothing, raw materials, consumer goods 
and many other things to businesses and consumers are at the heart of the

modern global economy. While every supply chain has its own unique realities 
and characteristics, they are broadly defined by their complexity and opacity. 
Both factors make it difficult for those involved - producers, suppliers, 
processors, distributors, retailers, consumers, etc - to trust the other parties in 
that chain. 
 
Whether regional, intranational, international or global, supply chains often 
involve numerous actors with myriad different standards, quality assurance 
mechanisms and record-keeping processes. In addition, members of a supply 
chain often have to coordinate with various governments and third-party 
organisations to cross borders, pay customs or certify the authenticity 
of products.  
 
To take a short example, even the production of a something as seemingly 
simply as a Christmas jumper involves numerous different parties and 
organisations. Before a shopper can purchase a new Rudolph jumper, the 
wool needs to sourced by a shepherd, shipped to a mill, processed into yarn, 
shipped to a knitting company or clothing manufacturer, woven into a jumper, 
shipped to a distributor, and finally shipped to a retailer. Every time the wool or 
jumper changes hands the interaction needs to be documented on a ledger 
with information such as time, weight, temperature, value, customs 
information or ownership rights. 
 
If that jumper were to be shipped internationally or if it were to include other 
materials or design elements - eg an electric nose or plastic sequins - then the 
supply chain would grow even more complex and opaque. Given the varying 
processes and record-keeping standards of each link in that chain, the 
prospect of tracking the constituent parts of that jumper from source to 
finished product can be daunting. Complicating matters is the fact that often 
an individual member of a supply chain will have little to no contact with, or 
knowledge of, other members beyond those with whom they interact directly. 
 
While many existing, centralised supply chains function adequately and 
effectively using traditional methods, there is growing concern about the lack 
of accountability and the lack of ability to trace the movement of goods 
through different supply chains. This is not only a concern for end consumers 
but, increasingly, for the businesses that rely on, and participate in, these 
supply chains. Issues such as unsustainability, lack of accountability, 
counterfeiting, poor working conditions or child labour are not only bad for 
society but can have a serious impact on the reputation of the businesses 
providing the end product - even when they are not aware or 
directly responsible. 
11
 
There are many who hope that creating a distributed, immutable, transparent 
ledger to record supply chain events, transactions and interactions might help 
tackle some of these issues. They argue that distributed ledgers may be able 
to create a trusted environment that can bring together the various parties 
involved in a supply chain and help to solve some of the challenges raised by 
the increasing complexity and opacity of global supply chains.

Supply chains, the way they’re governed and how data is 
shared is so fundamentally broken that I think supply 
chains have been looking for a technology solution for a 
while. For a while everyone thought it was the ‘Internet of 
Things’ that was going to save the day, and now everyone 
has shifted into blockchain is going to save the day. It’s a 
bit of both, but I think blockchains have shown people that 
work in supply chains this fantastic new frontier for 
collaborating and reinforcing rules.

Supply chain case studies: Everledger and arc-net 
 
Everledger 
12
Everledger tracks the provenance of high value assets on a distributed 
ledger. Using a combination of public and private blockchains, Everledger 
can give network participants the capability of viewing the ownership and 
transaction history of a high value asset, whilst still prohibiting access to 
sensitive or confidential information to those without permission.  
 
Verifying the provenance of a high value asset is difficult, in part because a 
store-bought asset will have one document that proves authenticity and 
another that proves ownership. Keeping those documents associated with 
the asset is challenging, especially if one of them is lost or stolen. In 
Everledger’s solution, metadata points are extracted from the asset to create 
a digital thumbprint - a record on the blockchain that is created using the 
asset’s defining characteristics, such as its history, current ownership and 
dimensions. This thumbprint can then be used to verify authenticity. 
 
In 2015, Everledger started working with manufacturers and retailers from 
across the diamond supply chain in order to create a historical ledger that 
documents the movement of diamonds. The ledger contains data about the 
origin and certification of the diamonds and processes involved in 
manufacturing them.  
 
arc-net 
By working with companies in the food and beverage industry to establish a 
chain of custody around their products, arc-net helps companies to improve 
their approach to product and supply chain authentication. 
 
arc-net uses private blockchains within production environments that are 
designed to integrate with public chains if necessary. When products are first 
registered to the blockchain, they are assigned a Universal Unique Identifier 
(UUI) that references data about the product such as location of origin and 
DNA (if the product includes animal products). The product is mapped and 
tracked through processing, so when the final product is packaged it

receives a unique QR code that can be scanned using a smartphone to 
reveal the history and provenance of the product. 
 
arc-net recently partnered with Adelphi’s Ardnamurchan Distillery on a 
limited edition spirit production by marking and authenticating each bottle 
that they produced. The bottles could be tracked from the distillery, 
13
through the network of suppliers and finally to the consumer. The consumer 
received confirmation and blockchain data for each unique bottle, thereby 
eliminating the possibility that the bottle was a counterfeit. 
 
Because distributed ledgers produce a single, immutable, decentralised record of 
events and transactions, distributed ledger technologies have the potential to 
improve transparency and inform trust between members of industries beyond 
supply chains and the finance sector. As companies continue to work to implement 
these technologies over the coming years, it is likely that they will prove their value 
even more widely. Efforts at implementing distributed ledgers should focus on use 
cases or industries that could benefit from greater trust and transparency. In other 
words, businesses that are thinking about implementing distributed ledgers should 
understand what distributed ledger technologies can and cannot offer, and identify 
how distributed ledger technologies can be used to address their current 
real-world problems. 
 
The remaining sections of Part 1 detail the emergence of smart contracts as an 
extension of distributed ledger technologies, and explore the role they might play in 
underpinning trust and creating efficiencies in interactions between people, 
businesses, governments and other organisations. 
 
 
What are smart contracts? 
 
The implementations of distributed ledgers discussed in the previous section have 
potential for underpinning trust in interactions between people, businesses and 
governments. However, perhaps some of the greatest promise of distributed ledgers 
lies in their ability to host smart contracts - sometimes referred to as the third 
generation of distributed ledger technologies. There are many different definitions of 
14
smart contracts, but our preferred definition comes from Gideon Greenspan: 
15
 
“ 
A smart contract is a piece of code that is stored on a 
blockchain, triggered by blockchain transactions and 
which reads and writes data in that blockchain's 
database. 
– Gideon Greenspan

Impossible’, ​https://www.coindesk.com/three-smart-contract-misconceptions/  
 
Open Data Institute 2018 / Technical reportHow can smart contracts be useful for businesses?   14 

 
 
This simple definition captures what most consider to be the essence of smart 
contracts; at their core, smart contracts are executable computer code stored on a 
blockchain or other distributed ledger. The aim of smart contracts is to enable certain 
actions to occur automatically within distributed ledger systems. Similar to most 
mature database systems, you can write out a set of rules within the database 
system that, when triggered by certain conditions, result in a change to the state of 
the database. 
 
By providing a means to automate processes taking place within distributed ledger 
systems, smart contracts potentially offer a way of codifying more complex 
interactions than an immediate value exchange, all while retaining the benefit of 
informing trust inherent to distributed ledgers. For example, a business could 
programme a smart contract so that when a customer purchases a service, the smart 
contract is triggered and they are automatically sent a confirmation email and given 
access to the service. 
 
 
Key features of smart contracts 
 
We have identified seven key features that useful smart contracts should have. 
Specifically, we have focused on the features that need to be considered when 
trying to implement smart contracts to solve real-world problems. 
 
●Automated​ – the execution of smart contract code requires no manual 
intervention  
●Deterministic​ – given the same initial conditions, the executed code 
should always give the same result 
●Virtual​ – both the conditions and the consequences of the contract 
must be represented within the ledger 
●Unalterable​ – the conditions and consequences of the contract cannot 
be changed, except in ways that are originally anticipated within the 
contract itself 
●Irreversible​ – transactions that occur according to the terms of the 
contract create permanent changes within the ledger  
●Available​ – anyone (who has permission) is able to trigger the 
execution of the contract code at any time 
●Auditable ​– the code, input and output of the smart contract is 
reviewable by any member of the network 
 
 
The reason smart contracts might be used, as opposed to automation on a standard 
centralised system or database, is that they explicitly interact with a distributed 
ledger. This means that they are triggered by changes to the distributed ledger and 
make changes to the same ledger, and as a result can automate processes within 
distributed ledger systems.  
 
They are also stored on the ledger, as opposed to being automated processes that 
just read and write to the ledger, meaning that the executable code itself has the 
same properties as other records on a distributed ledger. From these properties, 
especially immutability and transparency, smart contracts derive their potential to 
underpin and inform trust. Being stored on the ledger itself means that the person or 
organisation triggering a smart contract does not need to rely on the organisation or 
person who wrote the automated process to deliver the expected outcome, rather 
the system itself guarantees delivery, without intervention from any other party. 
 
 
Open Data Institute 2018 / Technical reportHow can smart contracts be useful for businesses?   15 

 
 
Smart contracts – misleading terminology? 
The term ‘smart contracts’ is generally considered to be somewhat 
misleading. When asked to define a smart contract, many of our interviewees 
replied that most were neither ‘smart’, in the sense of ​exhibiting adaptive 
behaviour​, nor ‘contracts’, in the sense of a legal agreement. While there 
have been a number of efforts to create legally enforceable smart contracts, 
use of this term is often held to be misleading given that most smart 
contracts are not intended to have a legal function.  
 
“It has almost nothing to do with legal contracts at all – if the word contract 
was not used, no one would assume any connection to the legal context, so 
this is a source of gigantic confusion.”  
– Interview participant 
16
 
There is clear potential for smart contracts to be used to automate some 
aspects of legal agreements, but usage of the term ‘smart contract’ should 
not be allowed to crowd out other potential implementations beyond this 
narrow definition.  
 
Trusted interactions through smart contracts 
The promise of smart contracts therefore lies in their potential to enable transparent, 
auditable and efficient interactions between people, businesses and governments. 
For a long time, automating parts of interactions has been seen as a source of 
efficiency and savings for businesses and other organisations. A rudimentary 
example might be an automatic monthly debit where a person or business agrees to 
let a service provider automatically debit payment from a given account.  
 
In this example, this simple interaction is automated in such a way that makes it more 
efficient than it would be if handled manually. However, both parties must rely on a 
third party - the bank - to execute the arrangement, and trust it to do so in the way 
they both expect. While it is unlikely that a lack of trust would undermine such a 
simple arrangement, in more complex scenarios, relying on third parties can create 
risks, central points of failure and inefficiencies. These challenges arise not only from 
the complexity of the interaction - for example, payment for services based on a 
variety of criteria - but also the complexity of the networks involved, for example 
where a process relies on interactions between a wide range of actors who are not in 
direct contact. 
 
It is in the more complex interactions and networks that characterise many real-world 
industries that many of our interviewees saw potential for smart contracts. Trust 
tends to be more dispersed in industries where networks of businesses and 
customers are dispersed by geography, role, size and other factors. In these 
industries, trusted third parties are less likely to exist and it can be difficult to cultivate 
trust across organisational and institutional boundaries. 
 
Using smart contracts, businesses and other organisations involved in these complex 
networks are able to codify interactions directly into a shared, distributed, immutable 
database. By building on the properties of distributed ledgers, this enables 
automation of processes in a transparent manner, meaning that all actors in a given 
network witness the interaction. Not only can each member of the network review the 
behaviour codified into particular smart contracts, the interactions create a 
permanent, auditable record on the distributed ledger.  
 
This transparency of interactions and the creation of an immutable record have the 
potential to remove the need for a trusted central authority or marketplace to 
approve, administer and record the interactions. Instead, these functions are carried 
16

out by every member of the network in a distributed manner, engendering trust 
throughout the network. 
 
 
Supply chain use case: smart contracts 
Because supply chains are made up of a number of disparate companies 
with their own needs and aims, it is often difficult for the individual members 
of a supply chain to trust each of the other participants in that chain. 
Distributed ledgers and smart contracts offer the opportunity to increase 
transparency and engender trust between the various members of a supply 
chain and hold the potential to realise efficiencies in the interactions between 
those parties. It is because of this that supply chains are the most prominent 
use case for distributed ledgers and smart contracts.  
 
Considering the important role supply chains play in society, any efficiencies 
and improvements that can be made have potentially huge benefits. 
Likewise, any errors and mistakes can cost businesses and consumers 
dearly. More than just offering a means to create transparency and 
auditability, many hope that smart contracts can help bring about efficiencies 
and confidence in the day-to-day management of supply chains. 
 
 
“ 
All the kinds of problems that certification and audit aim to 
address could potentially be remedied or streamlined a 
huge amount by blockchains and smart contracts, and I 
think that’s why everyone is getting very excited about it.

Supply chain case studies: Provenance and Sweetbridge 
 
Provenance 
Provenance is a platform that enables greater transparency and traceability 
within supply chains. Provenance was one of the first companies in the 
world to use blockchain technology in supply chains. Their case study, 
‘From shore to plate: Tracking tuna on the blockchain’, demonstrates their 
17
approach to supply chain transparency and traceability from the origin of a 
product to the point of sale. 
 
At the source of origin, Provenance worked with local fishermen to capture 
data about the collection of fish, using SMS messages to register each 
catch. This would issue a new asset ID on the blockchain for the product, 
containing data about its capture. The assets were then sold and 
transferred both physically and on the digital register to the supplier and 
could be identified using unique identifiers, such as QR codes. The history

of the digital asset could then be verified by local NGOs using 
Provenance’s blockchain explorer software. The NGOs would check the 
asset history against a recognised standard - eg if the fisherman is a 
member of the Pole and Line Foundation Association - to make sure that 
the fish have been sourced legally and ethically. From there, suppliers 
would register the fish, again on the blockchain. The digital asset would be 
verified by the trusted NGOs once more and this verification would execute 
a smart contract. The smart contract would signal that the fish was ready 
for processing and would allocate new digital asset IDs to containers, in 
which portions of the fish would be packaged, and link these new asset IDs 
to the original asset ID of the fish. Retailers who received the packaged 
products could identify each product using scannable shipping labels. The 
retailer would then attach an NFC smart sticker to each product, so that 
consumers could scan the sticker using Provenance’s Item Tracking 
Interface and see the journey of the item.  
 
The study aimed to provide proof of compliance to standards along the 
supply chain and determine whether distributed ledger technology could 
provide an open platform that would increase traceability and transparency 
of products in supply chains.  
 
 
Sweetbridge 
Sweetbridge are a blockchain-based protocol stack that works to enable 
supply chains to be more efficient without the involvement of third parties. 
They aim to enable companies who exist in a shared ecosystem to 
communicate with each other and share assets, and to make it easier for 
assets to be accurately valued by members of the ecosystem. Having these 
communication links and being able to accurately put a value to assets is 
particularly important for smaller companies, who may want to have access 
to several public ledgers in order to work with multiple larger organisations, 
but also need assurances that assets retain their specific value as they 
make their way from the start of the supply chain to the end.  
 
Sweetbridge place an emphasis on the importance of building applications 
that increase the liquidity of financing and payments while enabling the 
efficient flow of product and state information on top of distributed ledger 
technologies. Smart contracts – which Sweetbridge refer to as 
‘programmable work flows’ – can be one of these applications, and are 
usually introduced in order to implement logical processes, such as 
automatically allocating tasks to different companies in the supply chain in 
response to the record of a new transaction.  
 
The companies that Sweetbridge work with often want tailored, 
permissioned applications on a private blockchain that help them maintain 
their competitive edge, but also enable them to foster their own ecosystem 
within their specific supply chain by giving permissioned access to close 
business partners, such as suppliers and retailers. This type of application 
can be beneficial to most of the actors within the ecosystem, although 
much of the control remains in the hands of the company for whom the 
application has been built.  
Are smart contracts and distributed ledgers right for my business? 
Whether or not businesses choose to implement smart contracts depends 
considerably on the specifics of the potential use case, the industry context and the 
needs of those involved. Because of this, and the fact that the technology is still 
emerging, there are few established rules or parameters that can be universally 
applied when deciding whether to pursue smart contracts.  
 
 
Open Data Institute 2018 / Technical reportHow can smart contracts be useful for businesses?   18 

 
 
One widely offered piece of advice expressed by our interviewees was that 
businesses should make sure that they identify a problem first, before considering the 
application of these technologies. The problem businesses are trying to solve should 
be well-defined and characterised by a lack of trust between the actors involved. In 
addition, it should exist in an industry or context where there is no central authority 
that would be trusted by those involved to administer a centralised solution. 
18
 
“ 
For people who are ‘outside of Blockchain’, who are 
coming from the corporate world, who are doing various 
other kinds of things - they are approaching it from first 
principles and they’re approaching it from what are their 
business problems. What they’re seeing is there’s a 
technology that enables them to attack old problems in 
new ways. 
– Interview participant 
19
 
While the vision and promise seems clear in use cases that fit these general criteria, 
an additional question businesses should ask is whether smart contracts and 
distributed ledgers can deliver on their promise today, in tackling real-world 
problems, without requiring an unprecedented industry shift in business practice. 
 
“ 
We have some partners and clients who are really bought 
into the fully trustless method and believe that might be 
the only way in order to actually create transparency and 
traceability, and I agree that the only way we’ll ever get full 
traceability and transparency in the world’s supply chains 
is through something that is fully decentralised and 
trustless. But I think we’ve got a long way to go. 
– Jessi Baker, Provenance 
 
 
In many cases, it will be the needs and desires of a company’s clients and the 
industries in which that company works that will define whether or not smart 
contracts will prove useful. By understanding that industry context and the general 
criteria around lack of trust, businesses should be able to make reasonable 
judgements on the applicability and potential usefulness of these technologies.

It’s important for us to make sure that we solve a problem 
that our clients and industry have so we need to find the

understand what the best option is today.

Part 2: Informing trust 
through traditional v 
high-tech mechanisms 
Businesses that identify potential uses for distributed 
ledgers and smart contracts in enabling trust will need 
to decide how to approach three key challenges when 
implementing new systems. 
Through our research, we have identified three key challenges that businesses 
implementing systems based on smart contracts should consider. Each of the three 
sections in Part 2 presents a challenge or set of challenges that might affect the 
design and performance of a system using smart contracts and distributed ledgers. 
We work through each of the challenges in the context of the supply chain use case 
and examine potential approaches to tackling these challenges. 
 
Within each of these approaches there are choices that have to be made - choices 
that revolve primarily around the need to choose between using existing trust 
mechanisms to guarantee parts of the system or designing an approach that ​draws 
upon the technical capabilities of the system​. For each, the choice is unlikely to be 
binary and will often depend on the context of the particular use case, meaning that 
businesses will have to navigate their way between the ideal and the pragmatic - 
between what might be possible given an ideal setting, and what is practical and 
achievable given a particular industrial, regulatory, or social context. 
Challenge 1: Representing the real world 
 
“ 
It’s important to make a distinction between the perfect 
world - where everything exists in a blockchain and 
everything can be resolved through consensus - and the 
real world. 
– Jess Houlgrave, Codex Protocol 
 
 
Every application of distributed ledgers requires some form of data to be recorded 
into the database. In almost all cases beyond cryptocurrencies, the reason for 
recording this data into the ledger is to create an immutable record of some 
real-world event or interaction. This raises a fundamental question of how within a 
distributed ledger one can represent data about a thing or event in the real world in a 
way that guarantees the data being stored in that digital ledger is in fact an accurate 
representation of that real-world thing or event. Put another way, to what extent can 
distributed ledgers, as a digital technology, guarantee the truth of the physical world? 
 
One person we interviewed argued that because of the origins of blockchain, many 
people remain confused about what the technology is capable of doing in terms of 
guaranteeing data integrity.  
 
Open Data Institute 2018 / Technical reportHow can smart contracts be useful for businesses?   21 

 
 
 
 
“ 
Bitcoin causes people to get very confused about this kind 
of thing because Bitcoin has this miraculous property of 
basically existing entirely inside the computer network. 
– Interview participant 
20
 
Thibaut Schaeffer from Provenance perfectly encapsulated this misconception and 
the problems that stem from it: “Obviously blockchain gives you really strong 
guarantees on what happens to data once it’s in the system but it doesn’t give you 
any guarantee about what the data is when it enters the system.” In short, if you’re 
going to trust the data stored in a distributed ledger, you need to work out 
mechanisms for injecting data into the ledger in a trusted manner.  
 
In addition to this, smart contracts themselves cannot access off-chain data sources 
directly. This is due to the distributed nature of blockchains: if a decentralised smart 
contract were to call a web-based API when the conditions within the ledger were 
met for nodes to execute the code, it would trigger this API call from every computer 
or node on the network. This would likely have a huge impact on the infrastructure of 
the data source (there were over 17,000 nodes on the public Ethereum network at the 
time of writing.)  
21
 
Further complicating matters is the fact that if the data being accessed by a smart 
contract is prone to fluctuations – for instance, real-time market prices or 
temperature readings – different nodes of a system might receive different data in 
response to the same API call, even if the calls are only separated by a matter of 
seconds. This would cause massive issues within the system, since smart contracts 
run by different nodes could come to different conclusions and therefore have 
conflicting copies of the database. Were this to happen, it would be more difficult for 
the network to reach consensus on which contracts to execute or what the next 
version of the database should be. Ultimately, it would hinder the system’s ability to 
guarantee a single version of truth or enable trust between different actors in the 
network.  
 
 
Supply chain use case: impact of weather on logistics 
By deploying distributed ledgers and smart contracts within a supply chain it 
would be possible to create a system wherein a supplier could trigger a smart 
contract designed to record the impact of poor weather conditions on the 
transport of goods, thereby creating a verifiable record that a certain supplier 
was not responsible for the late arrival of a shipment of goods. That smart 
contract might be designed to verify the data input by the supplier by 
comparing it to weather readings taken by a national weather service such as 
the UK Met Office. The contract would initiate an automated call to the Met 
Office API and, depending on whether the response aligned with the data 
input by the supplier, would then create a record validating the 
supplier’s claim. 
 
The challenge in implementing such a system is that since smart contracts 
need to be deterministic, each node that executes the contract code must 
come to the same conclusion. If every node has to call the Met Office API, it 
20

21
 For current network size, see: ​https://www.ethernodes.org/network/1  
 
Open Data Institute 2018 / Technical reportHow can smart contracts be useful for businesses?   22 

 
 
might overload the Met Office system, meaning some nodes do not get any 
data and therefore can’t execute the contract correctly. Furthermore, if a 
node that received an initial null response attempts to execute the contract 
again, it may not get the same weather reading from the API, leading to the 
creation of conflicting records within the system. For example, a contract 
could be written that would execute if the temperature in a certain location 
dropped below 0 degrees Celsius. If, after half the nodes called the API, the 
temperature reading was updated to above 0 degrees, the nodes would 
come to different conclusions when running the contract. 
 
 
As a result of these complications, data about real-world events must be injected into 
the ledger ​before​ any smart contracts attempt to execute their terms. Only after data 
has been recorded into the ledger can smart contracts be allowed to use that data to 
evaluate and trigger the contract. In the supply chain example above, this would 
involve injecting temperature readings from the UK Met Office API into the ledger, 
then allowing the supply chain smart contracts to consult the stored temperature 
value. This allows smart contracts to perform their operations entirely within the copy 
of the database held by each node, such that each node will receive exactly the same 
temperature reading and result in exactly the same decision about whether or not to 
execute the terms of the contract. This has the added benefit of creating an auditable 
record of the data being used - a record that could be used to understand the 
behaviour of a smart contract after the fact.  
 
The challenge that this presents for businesses that have decided to pursue 
smart contract implementations is how to record data in the ledger in a way that 
all members of the network can trust the accuracy of that data. ​This challenge 
exists even where the writing or reading of data from the ledger is handled 
automatically off the ledger, for example where an ‘Internet of Things’ sensor records 
objective measures, such as temperature or location, or where a smart contract 
22
unlocks a ‘smart lock’. This is because the distributed ledger cannot guarantee that 
23
the automatic, off-chain sensor will always behave in the expected manner. Even in 
fully automated systems, power cuts, faults, connectivity outages or vandalism can 
break the connection between the physical and digital world. 
Recording trusted data into the ledger using oracles 
The most common way of recording data into a distributed ledger in a trusted 
manner is through ‘oracles’. Oracles are people or businesses that are tasked with 
recording specific real-world data into the distributed ledger. In some cases oracles 
can even be tasked with reading the ledger and putting something into action in the 
physical world. The presence of an oracle within a system to some extent 
24
reintroduces the need to place trust in third parties: the oracles are ​trusted​ to provide 
accurate data. However, oracles do not necessarily reintroduce the need to trust a 
single third party, since it is possible for multiple oracles, performing multiple 
functions, to exist within a single system. For example, the existence of multiple

oracles providing similar types of data allows businesses to choose between trusted 
authorities, whereas in other cases trusted oracles may provide authoritative sources 
of different types of cross-referenceable data. Either of these ultimately results in a 
wider distribution of trust within the system when compared to a system where a 
single authority provides or collates all different types of data. 
 
If oracles are required for a particular use case, businesses will need to inform and 
incentivise trust in those oracles to provide accurate data against which smart 
contracts can be run. From our interviews, there were broadly two approaches taken 
by companies building systems based on distributed ledgers.  
 
 
i) Informing trust through existing, traditional trust mechanisms 
 
Several of the companies we spoke to were designing systems where data would be 
injected using existing trust mechanisms in some way. In particular, there were 
several cases where our interviewees did not see an issue with using an official 
organisation or authoritative body to act as a trusted third-party oracle. In certain 
cases, it might be possible to use trusted sources of data - or versions of official truth 
- that are publically available, potentially as open data. However, in other cases, the 
members of a network may wish to directly involve an authoritative body in inserting 
the required data into the ledger - though this would likely require some 
incentivisation of the authoritative body. Incentivising participation might be useful in 
guaranteeing that the trusted organisation continues to provide the required data 
over the lifetime of a smart contract. 
 
Another case where traditional trust mechanisms may have a role to play in inserting 
data into a distributed ledger would be when an organisation is responsible for 
generating data based on their reputation and expertise - for example, organisations 
tasked with certification. 
 
In cases where trusted third parties are required, there are often existing 
non-technology-based incentives and mechanisms to enforce their behaviour, 
such as the desire of an authoritative body or trusted organisation to maintain their 
reputation or standing. While these types of systems place trust in third parties, 
many of the companies developing such systems believe they still improve 
efficiency and are preferable to systems that do not utilise distributed ledgers. 
 
Supply chain use case: certification 
One of the main use cases for trusted third-party oracles involves 
certification – where an organisation or initiative creates a set of standards 
for supply chain behaviour, audits supply chain businesses against these 
standards and awards businesses with a ‘certificate’ if they comply with 
these standards. These authoritative, neutral certification bodies often 
focus on particular supply chain issues in certain industries, such as the 
Marine Stewardship Council (MSC), which focuses on sustainability in the 
fishing industry.  
25
 
These types of organisations could potentially act as trusted oracles, using 
distributed ledgers to issue certificates for goods that meet predefined 
standards. These could help businesses to provide a transparent and 
immutable record of certification to consumers and other businesses. 
As a result, every member of the network would be able to verify that 
the certification came from a reputable certification body, thereby 
circumventing the need to trust the word of the supplier. 
 
Furthermore, certification could be carried out through smart contracts, 
where suppliers could submit evidence of compliance through the system 
25

Open Data Institute 2018 / Technical reportHow can smart contracts be useful for businesses?   24 

 
 
in a transparent manner. Similarly, supply chain smart contracts could be 
triggered by the process of certification. For example, a purchaser’s smart 
contract could be set up to only execute if the goods in question have been 
certified by one of these certification bodies. These applications of smart 
contracts could improve the efficiency with which certification or proof of 
certification takes place. 
 
“Having a centralised oracle is definitely one way and I think it works 
for many, many cases – especially for certification – where you want 
to know that someone is certified by a particular entity.”  
– Thibaut Schaeffer, Provenance 
 
 
ii) Informing trust by drawing on the technical capabilities of the system 
 
While in some cases businesses implementing smart contracts are relying on existing 
trust mechanisms to engender trust in the data inserted into the ledger, other 
businesses are pursuing ways of using economic incentives and the technical 
capabilities of distributed ledgers to engender trust in that data. In moving away from 
a system that relies on trusted organisations to inject data, businesses are attempting 
to get closer to a system that internally rewards the provision of accurate data. 
As Thibaut from Provenance explained: 
 
“ 
For other things, you have to move away from the 
centralised expert to some extent, and blockchains 
provide ways to engineer governance directly using the 
currency mechanisms that you have built into blockchain. 
You can incentivise data submission from the crowd and 
there’s not this problem that you have to trust a third 
party. 
 
 
The idea of incentivising data submission using economic incentives built into a 
distributed ledger system is at the heart of the system being developed by Oraclize.  
 
“ 
You don’t want to just trust our third party. The third party 
should not be trusted. What we do is we prove through 
some cryptographic techniques that the data we fetch 
was not tampered with or altered by us. We provide a safe 
layer, which can prove to you that we didn’t touch the 
data, and this safe layer comes with the trust of a much 
bigger party. Perhaps it could be Amazon or Google or 
Intel or Microsoft.  It’s very difficult not to have the initial 
trust party but the idea is that if you can have many large 
and competing third parties then you have much higher 
 
Open Data Institute 2018 / Technical reportHow can smart contracts be useful for businesses?   25 

 
 
guarantees of security because to tamper with the data 
they will have to all cooperate, and even then they could 
be found out. 
– Marco Giglio, Oraclize 
 
 
 
Deciding how to guarantee the integrity of data 
 
All companies looking to implement smart contracts on distributed ledger systems to 
solve real-world problems are likely to have to access data from beyond the system 
itself. Businesses will therefore need to decide how they will go about getting 
real-world data into the ledger in a trusted way and, importantly, how they will 
guarantee the continued functioning of any system they develop. The method 
businesses choose will depend on the type of data involved, the existing context of 
the industry, and what exactly they require from the system being built. Indeed, there 
are likely to be lots of use cases where both approaches might be required for 
different parts of the system. 
 
Supply chain use case: example decisions 
 
●If a smart contract requires weather data, it may be enough for all actors 
to trust an official weather service. 
●If a company needs to know whether a contractor is certified, then it 
may be enough to trust data recorded by a certification authority.  
●If a smart contract requires data about the market price of a product, 
say a Rudolph jumper, then it may be better to rely on incentive 
mechanisms and the technical features of distributed ledgers.  
●A single system might need multiple approaches, for example requiring 
certification by central authorities but a marketplace approach for 
contextual data. 
 
 
Relying on a trusted third party has the advantage of being simpler to implement 
since it builds upon existing trust mechanisms. However, the drawbacks are that it 
may to some extent recentralise trust within the system, and in some cases it might 
not be feasible to find sufficiently trustworthy third parties within a given system.  
 
Relying on cryptographic proofs and economic incentives has the advantage of 
maintaining the distribution of trust in a way that should not be easy to manipulate or 
control. However, these approaches are currently unproven and might be difficult to 
design. Incentivising accurate data provision may require additional funding within 
the system and resolving multiple data sources might require more processing, 
making these mechanisms more expensive to run.  
 
Tackling the challenge of representing the real world  
 
Businesses looking to use distributed ledgers and smart contracts to solve 
real-world problems will need to: 
●assess the existing levels of trust within their particular industry or 
sector, and the requirements of the network 
 
Open Data Institute 2018 / Technical reportHow can smart contracts be useful for businesses?   26 

 
 
●identify the most appropriate injection mechanism for each type of data 
that needs to be recorded in the ledger. Note that for different types of 
data, the appropriate mechanism may be different or may involve a 
mixture of various approaches. Businesses could: 
○consider using traditional trust mechanisms in cases where 
trusted third parties already exist 
○explore building incentive mechanisms to validate and record 
data in cases where there are no authoritative sources

Challenge 2: Edge cases, bugs and arbitration 
 
“ 
Automation of processes where everything just runs like 
clockwork will be the case for 99 per cent of things. The 
areas where you would need human intervention are the 
edge cases, and the unwillingness to accept that there will 
be edge cases is potentially fatal. 
– Interview participant 
26
 
Ensuring that there are mechanisms to record accurate data into a distributed ledger 
in a trustworthy manner is a key part of enabling smart contracts to be used to 
automate a variety of processes. However, even where smart contracts execute 
based on accurate data, there will almost certainly be times where they do not 
function as expected. Despite the high-profile cases of malicious attacks like the 
failure of the DAO and the various vulnerabilities identified in smart contracts, 
2728
most of the people we interviewed for this report believed these failures represent 
edge cases rather than inherent flaws in smart contracts as a whole. These edge 
cases, however, present a challenge for any business looking to use smart contracts 
to tackle real-world issues.  
 
 
The challenge of developing smart contracts 
 
Such edge cases may arise from foreseeable and unforeseeable changing real-world 
conditions that invalidate their function, such as a supplier in the supply chain going 
out of business. However, the majority of reported cases of smart contracts not 
functioning as intended have arisen from malicious or unintended exploitation of 
flaws in smart contract code.  
29
 
One often cited reason for these vulnerabilities is the fact that the languages and 
environments that smart contracts are written and operate in are relatively new, 
and are in many cases still under development. As with any emerging software 
environment, this is bound to lead to edge cases where systems behave in 
unexpected ways since the systems themselves are adapted through use and the 
best way of implementing a given task is often defined ad hoc by individual 
programmers. In line with expectations from software development, these issues 
should decrease over time. However, the speed at which smart contract-based 
applications are being pushed live, and the immutability of smart contracts once they 
are written into a distributed ledger, means any potential vulnerabilities or flaws may 
have an impact on real-world implementations for longer than usual. 
 
It can even be argued that the very same properties and features that make smart 
contracts potentially useful for automating business processes in complex industrial 
environments ultimately make them more vulnerable to exploitation than existing 
methods of automation. For example, because smart contract code stored on a

distributed ledger is immutable, it cannot be directly altered, updated or patched in 
response to issues in the same way that almost all other software development can 
be. To deal with this, most smart contracts are created with a kill switch – a way of 
stopping them from carrying out their terms – which is triggered when a new version 
goes live. However, these switches have also been exploited to carry out 
‘unauthorised’ shutdowns of functionality. 
30
 
Another factor that contributes to the vulnerability of smart contracts is that they are 
difficult to test before deployment, especially where they interact with other contracts 
or real-world processes. Once deployed, it may also be harder to catch potential 
bugs before they are exploited since network members are not only able to trigger a 
smart contract immediately but concurrently in large numbers. Finally, all code is 
stored on the ledger, which every member of the network has a copy of; this might 
make the contracts easier to exploit, though lessons from open source software 
development indicate that having many eyes on code can equally make it easier to 
identify and fix bugs. 
 
Challenges in the technical development of smart contracts 
 
●Emerging languages and environments are naturally difficult to write 
code in 
●Immutability means flawed code cannot be directly altered, updated or 
patched, meaning a new contract must be launched and the old one 
killed 
●Kill switches designed to stop smart contracts from functioning can be 
maliciously or unintentionally triggered  
●Complex behaviour and dependencies can be difficult to test before 
deployment 
●Bugs can often be exploited at any time, by any member of the network 
with permission, until a contract is killed 
 
 
While the problems caused by these potential vulnerabilities may seem 
insurmountable, many depend on context. Most of the recent exploitations of smart 
contracts have involved non-permissioned contracts on public ledgers. The types of 
malicious behaviour likely to exploit smart contracts may in fact be limited to these 
cases, especially when there are large financial incentives, in the form of 
cryptocurrencies, for carrying out exploitations. 
 
In many potential applications of smart contracts, malicious exploitation is unlikely to 
be as highly incentivised for the participants – especially in cases where the network 
is primarily made up of businesses with reputations and relationships to maintain. 
While malicious exploitation might be less likely to occur in these cases, it is still more 
than likely that a not insignificant number of smart contracts will naturally contain 
bugs which cause them to behave in unpredictable or undesirable ways. In these 
cases, if a contract executes counter to the way it was intended to function, this 
discrepancy would need to be amended.  
 
In cases where smart contracts execute in an unexpected manner, a mechanism for 
appeal should be in place if the system is to be trusted by its users. In many use 
cases, it might be possible for this to be resolved through correction by the entity 
responsible for creating that smart contract. In other cases, where the contract 
behaves in an unexpected manner, but the party who created it is unable or unwilling 
to correct this behaviour, some sort of arbitration mechanism will be required to 
settle the dispute. Finally, related to the first challenge of data integrity, smart 
30

Open Data Institute 2018 / Technical reportHow can smart contracts be useful for businesses?   29 

 
 
contracts may trigger or respond to inaccurate data injected by an oracle – either 
deliberately or by accident. This would also require some form of arbitration. 
 
Supply chain use case: dispute requirement examples 
During the lifetime of a supply chain smart contract, such as the earlier 
weather example, the contract might at some point, for whatever reason, 
receive an extreme temperature or other input value. The result could be that 
the smart contract does not record or verify the suppliers’ claim. In this 
situation, the supplier might want to dispute the outcome of the smart 
contract. It is possible that the party who created the smart contract would be 
able to issue a correction and rewrite and deploy the contract to avoid further 
bugs. However, they may be unwilling to do this, arguing that the oracle (the 
Met Office in this example) is responsible. In this case, it is likely that if the Met 
Office, as an oracle, is not willing to take responsibility, some form of dispute 
resolution will need to occur. 
 
 
Resolving disputes 
 
As with the first challenge of injecting data about the physical world into a digital 
ledger, there are broadly two different ways to approach this complication when it 
comes to smart contracts – either placing trust in traditional existing mechanisms to 
arbitrate disputes, or trying to create resolution mechanisms within the system itself 
using the properties of distributed ledgers and economic incentives. 
 
As Thibaut from Provenance put it, within these emerging systems you “start seeing 
arbitration as a service”, so “if there’s a dispute, you can delegate the resolution of 
that dispute to a kind of ‘arbitration court’.” He went on to explain that you can run 
this court in different ways: 
 
“ 
You could either run it through a trusted body so that 
would be like an actual court, or you could run it with 
economic incentives, for example by choosing people at 
random and rewarding them if they are honest and do 
their duty, make the right choice. 
– Thibaut Schaeffer, Provenance 
 
 
Whether a company chooses the former or latter option will again depend on the use 
case, the existing conditions within the industry in question and what the company is 
designing the system to do. Since smart contracts will likely play a role in 
already-established systems, many of those systems will already have mechanisms 
for dispute resolution that could be used. 
 
 
i) Existing trust mechanisms 
 
Systems that rely on existing trusted third parties have the advantage of minimising 
the requirement for industries to adopt new governance regimes. In many use cases, 
existing legal mechanisms for dispute resolution already exist that would likely be 
able to fulfil this role. However, this would require legal professionals to understand 
the functioning of the smart contracts in place and for both parties to place trust in 
these legal systems.  
 
Open Data Institute 2018 / Technical reportHow can smart contracts be useful for businesses?   30 

 
 
 
Placing trust in these legal systems might be particularly challenging when the use 
case stretches across legal jurisdictions (as with global supply chains) since different 
members of the network might have different expectations regarding legal process, 
and different jurisdictions might have different interpretations of agreements. Perhaps 
most importantly, traditional dispute resolution mechanisms are precisely the types of 
systems that are currently deemed as inefficient and expensive, and therefore often 
what the adoption of smart contracts is intended to minimise.  
 
ii) Distributed dispute resolution 
 
For this reason, some businesses are exploring new ways of resolving disputes using 
the distributed nature of the systems they are building. Systems that rely on members 
of the network to act as arbiters have the advantage bypassing the need to trust a 
central administrator to define what counts as truth within the ledger, thereby 
avoiding the costs associated with traditional mechanisms. One approach currently 
being explored by Ocean Protocol, a company building a decentralised data 
exchange based on blockchain, would be to establish a formal reputation system 
within their platform to incentivise trustworthy behaviour.  
 
Others are looking at how consensus governance mechanisms and distributed pools 
of arbiters could be used to resolve disputes and how economic incentives might be 
set up to reward just arbitration. The challenge with such systems is that they may 
31
be difficult to establish, potentially add greater cost to the system and could in some 
cases mirror the inefficiencies of existing mechanisms. 
 
Going off-chain? 
 
In response to the challenges of edge cases, bugs and the need for 
arbitration, some have proposed that the solution is to store and execute 
smart contract code off the ledger itself. This would result in automation of 
processes that could read and write into the ledger but the execution of these 
processes would not be carried out in a distributed manner. While there are 
clear benefits to avoiding edge cases, this approach sacrifices some of the 
central proposed benefits of smart contracts – in particular, such a system 
would not be able to independently execute the terms of a contract. For this 
reason, there are those who argue this type of automation cannot be 
considered equivalent to the type of automation achieved through smart 
contracts. 
 
“People that are doing a lot of the off-chain stuff, it’s kind of square 
peg in a round hole type, if they’re trying to call it blockchain when 
really, it’s not. It’s off the chain. It’s not smart contract workflow driven, 
it’s not being recorded to a large extent on the distributed record.”  
– ​Todd Taylor, Supply Chain Advisor​ at Sweetbridge 
 
All companies looking to use smart contracts to tackle real-world problems will need 
to plan for edge cases, decide how they want to deal with them and determine how 
they will enable users to resolve disputes and issue corrections. The choice of 
resolution mechanism will be driven by the particular use case, the existing systems 
in place and the specific function the smart contracts are being asked to perform. In 
many cases, there might be the opportunity to use new technological approaches to 
resolve some forms of dispute while relying on existing, traditional mechanisms, such 
as the legal system, for complicated or especially contentious cases.

Tackling edge cases, bugs and arbitration 
 
Companies working to implement distributed ledgers and smart contracts will 
need to: 
●understand that while smart contracts can automate a number of 
different business operations, there will still be cases where things go 
wrong 
●plan for edge cases and choose the most appropriate mechanisms for 
resolving disputes and issuing corrections when they arise. They could: 
○consider using traditional mechanisms in cases where existing 
arbitration would be sufficient 
○explore using the features of distributed ledgers to provide 
technological mechanisms for dispute resolution in cases where 
existing mechanisms may be cumbersome or not fit for purpose

Challenge 3: Cryptocurrencies and financial incentives 
Another key aspect of distributed ledger systems that companies exploring how 
smart contracts might be used to tackle real-world challenges need to consider is 
how to pay for the system – both its implementation and operation. In a related way, 
one of the main challenges facing businesses will be how to incentivise other parties 
– other businesses, certification bodies, NGOs etc. – to use the system. Since the 
main potential benefits of distributed ledgers and smart contracts for underpinning 
trust come from the network, businesses must ensure these systems have the 
participation and trust of all the parties involved in order to create value. 
 
 
Paying for the operation of a distributed ledger 
 
Like all databases, distributed ledgers require digital storage and processing power 
to carry out operations within the database. As explained earlier in this report, public 
distributed ledgers use a variety of consensus mechanisms as part of their design – 
relying on financial incentives, in the form of cryptocurrency, to incentivise and 
reward participation in the process of creating new versions of the distributed ledger. 
While some systems use a communal pot to pay for some of this reward, most also 
use transaction fees from users to pay for these incentives – meaning anyone who 
wants to commit data to the database must pay to do so. 
 
This requirement to provide financial incentives is increased in the case of smart 
contracts. As discussed earlier, when the required conditions are met, every 
computer executes the smart contract code independently to understand and verify 
the effect this operation has on the ledger. Every smart contract that is executed 
takes computing power to resolve, with more complicated contracts taking longer 
and using more resources to process. Because of this, a number of public systems 
charge a usage fee, based on the complexity of the contract. This fee is payable by 
32
the person or company triggering the contract – and is required every time they 
trigger it.  
 
Developing applications on public infrastructure has many benefits related to stability, 
integrity, transparency and independent verification. However, with more complex 
use cases, and volatile cryptocurrency prices, ​the cost of administering complex 
smart contracts​ ​may becoming increasingly ​prohibitive for businesses. In response, 
some companies developing smart contract applications have focused on 
permissioned and private ledgers – the main benefit being that there is no 
requirement to create and distribute a cryptocurrency with economic value, though 
these can be used if so desired. Because only a certain set of predefined 
organisations can run the nodes of a permissioned or private network, there is no 
need to incentivise unknown parties to host and administer the database.  
 
This can have the impact of reducing the overall cost of operating the system, even 
when operating many complex smart contracts simultaneously. However, because 
private and permissioned ledgers are generally smaller and less transparent, they 
arguably sacrifice some of the guarantees of public ledgers related to integrity and 
stability. In addition, by controlling who has access to the system, the governance of 
the system and its infrastructure becomes, in a sense, centralised. This may limit the 
amount of trust that those outside the system are willing to place in the network itself. 
 
Supply chain example: centralised setup and governance 
 
Another challenge that arises when operating smart contract systems comes 
from who is paying to establish the system. Most of the companies creating 
supply chain applications that we talked to were working with major 
32
 known as ‘gas’ in the case of Ethereum. 
 
Open Data Institute 2018 / Technical reportHow can smart contracts be useful for businesses?   33 

 
 
companies who are paying to establish the infrastructure to manage the 
supply chains they are involved in. Where systems are being developed and 
paid for by the major market player in a supply chain or ecosystem, it raises 
questions as to whether such a system will be able to realise the benefit of 
distributing trust since governance of that system will be centralised. 
 
“In these private blockchains there’s a primary entity and usually it’s 
the big brand that’s responsible for pulling everybody together and 
distributing product; that’s taking orders primarily and then trickling 
those back out through the supply chain. They’re the ones that are 
selecting and inviting, registering and permissioning the different 
participants and nodes on the network and then when things go awry, 
they’re the ones that probably have the dashboard and the analytics in 
place that allow them to go back and query and find out what 
happened and see if they need to do some things to remedy an 
inappropriate action.”  
– ​Todd Taylor, ​Sweetbridge 
 
 
The key question for businesses looking to implement smart contract systems is how 
to pay for the operation of the system in a way that retains trust of all the members of 
that system. This will likely depend on the purpose of the system, the level of trust 
between members of the network, how comfortable those members are with having 
their transaction records stored publically, and the willingness within the industry to 
contribute to such a system.  
 
“ 
There are multiple commercial models. We define them 
based on the sector in which we operate. For example, in 
the export market it’s actually the processor that pays for 
the service because the processor owns the supply chain, 
the farm and contract, the produce out. In terms of a 
retailer, in that case if it’s specific to the retailer then the 
retailer pays. 
– Kieran Kelly, arc-net 
 
 
Supply chain use case: operational choices examples 
 
In a supply chain, a number of different approaches might be taken to paying 
for the setup and operation of the system: 
 
●In a supply chain made up of similar-sized organisations who agree on 
an approach, the various members might choose to distribute the cost 
of setting up a private or permissioned ledger 
●In a supply chain with only a few equally-sized organisations 
interested in a solution, each might chose to run a node and fund the 
cost of their own transactions in a public ledger  
●In a supply chain with one large company, the central player might pay 
for someone to design and setup a private or permissioned system, 
which others can join at relatively low cost 
 
Open Data Institute 2018 / Technical reportHow can smart contracts be useful for businesses?   34 

 
 
 
 
Transacting value and incentivising participation 
 
In addition to paying for the setup and operation of the platform, any company 
looking to use distributed ledgers and smart contracts to tackle real-world business 
challenges will need to decide whether the system will be used to process financial, 
monetary or value transactions. Since distributed ledgers were originally designed to 
facilitate cryptocurrency transactions, they can be used to process financial 
exchange within the system. Smart contracts provide a means to automate these 
exchanges of value, and this is one of the primary use cases within the finance 
industry – for example, Clearmatics are aiming to automate financial transactions 
between businesses.  
33
 
For some people, systems underpinned by the exchange of financial value through 
the system itself (using cryptocurrency or cryptocurrency-like systems) are the only 
systems that deliver on the promise of smart contracts – in particular in reducing 
friction in business processes.  
 
“ 
The digital currency gives them an opportunity to settle 
much more quickly, to recognise payment much more 
quickly, to distribute those payments much more quickly 
across their value chain and to provide financing to some 
of the strategic partners within their value chain that might 
be paying obscene amounts of interest today that are 
hurting the value chain overall. 
– Todd Taylor, Sweetbridge 
 
 
By handling payment within the system, the blockchain can guarantee the integrity of 
payment and, using the features inherent to distributed ledgers, can encourage good 
behaviour through financial incentives. 
 
“ 
One way we can use incentives is to ensure that people 
are doing the right thing when they are using the system. 
In the sense that if things are free, people tend to abuse 
them. Very small transactions fees can often help to create
the right incentives. 
– Jess Houlgrave, Codex Protocol

Supply chain use case: exchanging value through a distributed ledger 
 
In a supply chain, transactions like paying for a shipment of goods could be 
administered within the system using a cryptocurrency or cryptocurrency-like 
system. Handling the transactions in this way within the supply chain would 
provide incentives to participate, potentially enabling faster transactions and 
payment clearing. In addition, it might also enable businesses within the 
supply chain to automate some of these interactions in ways that would not be 
feasible in centralised systems. 
 
For example, a smart contract could allow the automatic release of payment in 
response to the injection of data from a trusted third party confirming the 
delivery of a specified product. Both the buyer and seller in this example could 
trust the system to carry out the terms of the contract – even if neither 
completely trusted the other party. Finally, the inclusion of transaction costs 
might encourage members of the network to ensure they are using the system 
effectively and efficiently. 
 
 
However, many businesses trying to build applications on top of distributed ledgers 
have concerns about building cryptographic asset exchange mechanisms into their 
products and services. Some of the concerns raised during our interviews stem from 
the needs of users of the system, both in terms of usability and comfort. Many of our 
interviewees questioned whether users would be willing to learn the procedures 
required to actually use cryptocurrencies and questioned whether they would be 
prepared to rely on existing volatile cryptocurrencies as a mechanism for exchange. 
In response to this, some businesses have taken the approach of using the 
distributed ledger to keep a record of payments, but actually process those 
payments off the chain using traditional methods, such as bank transfers. 
 
“ 
We have never been involved in cryptocurrency at all. We 
don’t see a cryptocurrency element as a must have 
because you will have specific transactions and needs and
these will always occur in fiat currencies but we don’t 
necessarily need crypto for that. For me it’s not a must - 
you can if you want, but... 
– Calogero Scibetta, Everledger 
 
 
Although these types of approaches might be accused of sacrificing some of the 
advantages of smart contracts where payment is handled entirely on a distributed 
ledger, some argue that the systems retain advantages over manual, 
centralised approaches.

“ 
It’s certainly a misconception of lots of people that making 
payments happen faster is exclusively to do with the 
payment system and that’s not really true. We can send 
money quite quickly to lots of different places; the reason 
why people get paid late is nothing to do with whether 
you’re using Bitcoin or Ether or PayPal or a bank or 
whatever, it’s to do with working out who is the right 
person to pay and all of the challenges that go into all of 
that. You can separate out the two things and so I 
concluded some time ago that getting people paid faster 
and more reliably did not require using cryptocurrency. 
– Phil Barry, Blokur 
 
 
Whether or not systems require or enable users to exchange value through the 
system does not necessarily have an impact on how the system is designed to run. 
For example, systems that do not enable value exchange can be built and run on 
existing public ledgers, and only the operation of the system needs to be paid for in 
cryptocurrency. However, this is not exposed to the users of the system.  
 
As with both data recording and edge cases (the first and second challenges outlined 
above), it is possible to approach these payments in different ways – by relying on 
distributed ledger-based cryptocurrencies to process transactions, relying on 
traditional payment mechanisms, or not recording or transacting value at all. Again, 
these approaches are not necessarily exclusive; within a single platform designed for 
a particular use case, different parts of the system could adopt different approaches. 
 
“ 
As far as cryptocurrency, that is just one aspect of the 
technology. Codex is an infrastructure layer and not a 
direct application layer, so applications are built on top of 
that infrastructure - some of which may involve individuals 
interacting with cryptocurrency and some of which won’t. 
– Jess Houlgrave, Codex Protocol 
 
 
Whether or not businesses decide to exchange value through the distributed ledger 
will depend on the industry context and the willingness of potential users to 
participate. Our interviewees broadly agreed that exchanging value through the 
system itself might be useful, but that it was probably out of reach in most current 
use cases.

It’s going to take a stable token, a stable coin and that’s 
not easy to create. Being a central bank is not an easy job,
but settlement can be done, and trade network ledger can 
be done and it’s something that we’re working on.

Tackling the challenge of cryptocurrencies and financial 
incentives 
For those companies that choose to implement distributed ledgers and smart 
contracts to tackle real-world problems, it will be important to: 
●decide how the system will be governed and who will pay for its 
operation. The answer to these questions will depend on the use case, 
the existing systems in place within the industry in question, and the 
needs and desires of the parties involved:  
○In certain cases, businesses may prefer to govern the system 
cooperatively and pool their resources to pay for the operation of 
the system 
○In other cases, businesses may prefer to have one major 
company pay for the operation of the system and act as a central 
governing authority 
○These differences in preference will influence the decision of 
whether to choose a public, private, or permissioned ledger 
●decide whether or not value will be transferred within the system using 
cryptocurrency or cryptocurrency-like systems: 
○Adoption will depend on the industry context and each industry’s 
willingness to employ currencies and systems that are currently 
still rather volatile  
What type of smart contract and distributed ledger system is right 
for my business? 
Once a problem has been clearly defined, and there is the possibility that smart 
contracts and distributed ledgers might be useful, businesses will need to design 
an approach that takes into account not only the features and limitations of the 
technology, but the features and limitations of the industry or system in which the 
problem exists. Using this understanding, they should make decisions by asking the 
right questions.  
 
One of the main challenges that many companies are confronted with when figuring 
out how to implement distributed ledgers and smart contracts effectively is the 
tension between idealism and pragmatism – between what the technology could 
conceivably do given ideal conditions and what it can do now in the context of 
existing industries. Businesses must find an effective balance between these two 
competing approaches. If they do not, they will either limit the uptake of their 
proposed solution by being overly idealistic, or undermine the reason for using the 
technology in the first place by being overly pragmatic.

“ 
In order to build something that has an impact in the world 
it needs to be adopted. If nobody adopts your idea or 
product or system, it’s not making an impact. 
– Calogero Scibetta, Everledger 
 
 
Some within the blockchain community would argue that any compromise from the 
‘idealistic’ fully trustless vision for distributed ledgers nullifies their potential, but there 
appear to be cases where a pragmatic approach will still result in implementations 
that help to underpin trust within interactions. Many of those we interviewed 
expressed the view that distributed ledgers and smart contracts can be used to build 
upon existing processes and relationships without needing to replace them entirely – 
for example, using permissioned ledgers to bring together existing ecosystems or 
recording transactions on a distributed ledger but using traditional bank transfers to 
process payments. 
 
“ 
That’s one reason why we actually don’t take a role in 
verifying information because our intent isn’t to try and 
make this market a perfect market, it’s designed to make 
an improvement over the status quo. 
– Jess Houlgrave, Codex Protocol 
 
 
Beyond just enabling an improvement over the status quo, some businesses believe 
that by adopting a more pragmatic approach they are helping their industry take 
steps that will eventually lead them to more ‘ideal’ or fully trustless approaches – 
albeit slowly and incrementally. 
 
“ 
The reality is the world’s supply chains are run by a small 
number of companies and it’s not in their interest to 
facilitate a fully trustless system. But at the same time 
they’re conflicted because they want to end things like 
modern slavery in supply chains and they don’t want 
unsafe products – so they recognise that there’s potential 
for that type of system. Part of what we do is slowly 
walking those big guys through the doors that could 
enable them to be part of a fully decentralised system – 
it’s​ ​a journey.

Smart contracts for 
business: selecting 
systems 
The applicability of smart contracts depends firmly on 
the proposed use case and the ability of a business to 
define a problem, ask the right questions and remain 
pragmatic about a potential solution. 
The vision offered by the advocates of smart contracts and distributed ledgers 
centres around the ability for businesses and others to interact more efficiently and 
effectively than they do today. At the heart of this promise is the belief that 
distributed ledgers can be used to underpin trust in these interactions in ways that 
other centralised technologies might not. On top of this, smart contracts potentially 
offer a means to automate business processes and interactions in a way that enables 
less reliance on other trust mechanisms.  
 
In this report we have provided information we felt was important for businesses to 
know in order to make informed decisions about smart contracts. Our hope is that 
the information we have provided and the questions we have raised in Part 1 will 
enable businesses to ask some of the right questions when attempting to discern 
whether distributed ledgers and smart contracts could usefully be deployed within 
their businesses to solve real-world problems. In addition, we hope that the three 
challenges we have outlined in Part 2 will help businesses that have already decided 
to pursue smart contracts define the type of system that will most benefit their 
business and their clients. 
 
As the technology develops and as the use cases for distributed ledgers and smart 
contracts crystallise and, potentially, become more stable, the questions businesses 
will need to ask themselves will change, as will the challenges that businesses will 
need to confront. For instance, if the infrastructure matures, businesses may be able 
to more readily identify real-world problems that are capable of being addressed by 
distributed ledger technologies and smart contracts. In a similar way, a more mature 
infrastructure might decrease the likelihood of crippling bugs and therefore convince 
businesses that storing smart contract code on the chain offers the best way forward. 
As a final example, if a stable coin emerges in the next few years, businesses – 
and, importantly, their clients – may feel more comfortable exchanging value using 
distributed ledgers and smart contracts. Only time will tell. 
 
Regardless of how things develop over the coming years, the two related imperatives 
detailed above will remain: first, identify and define the problem to be solved before 
focusing on the technical solution; and second, remain pragmatic rather than 
idealistic about the capabilities of the technology and the context in which it is to be 
implemented. Businesses that follow these simple rules and prepare themselves to 
make decisions related to the three challenges identified above should be well 
prepared in their efforts to define whether, and how, distributed ledgers and smart 
contracts can help them tackle real-world business problems.

Appendix: Methodology 
The goal of this report was to offer neutral, unbiased advice to businesses to help 
them better understand the potential of smart contracts and distributed ledgers. 
It was part of a three-year research project funded by Innovate UK, the UK’s 
innovation agency.  
 
To help us begin our research we commissioned Navin Ramachandran, UCL Centre 
for Blockchain Technologies and IOTA Foundation, and James Brogan, MD 
candidate at Albert Einstein College of Medicine and Research Fellow at UCL Centre 
for Blockchain Technologies, to conduct an overview of relevant literature related to 
distributed ledgers and smart contracts, focusing on smart contracts as a potential 
solution to business problems. In addition to detailing the key features and 
characteristics of smart contracts and distributed ledgers, their report explored the 
potential limitations of smart contracts, the requirements for a platform to be able 
to support smart contracts, and how to integrate smart contracts with other 
technologies and processes - among other topics. 
 
Building upon this research, we conducted a landscape review of companies 
developing, implementing or using smart contracts. Businesses were targeted for 
interviews based on how they were attempting to implement smart contracts and 
the industries in which they were working.  
 
We conducted 14 interviews during the course of our research, 12 of which were 
conducted in person while two took the form of written answers to questions 
exchanged over email.  
 
We strove for a balance between people from academia, research institutions, 
startups and SMEs. Our interviewees were from companies headquartered in 
England, Northern Ireland, Singapore and the United States of America. As a 
reflection of the nature of the blockchain and smart contracts communities, many of 
the companies we spoke to were international in nature and scope with employees 
based in multiple countries around the world.
