Data trusts: a new paradigm in data stewardship 
Earlier this year, GPAI’s Data Governance Working Group launched its new project Enabling data sharing 
for  social  benefit  through  data  trusts.  This  project  set  out  to  help  realise  the  potential  of  data  trusts  as  a  
mechanism for trustworthy data sharing, by advancing research and practice that supports the creation of 
real-world data trusts. 
Data  trusts  are  a  type  of  data  institution  that  allows  individuals  or  groups  to  pool  resources,  tasking  an  
independent ‘trustee’ to manage those resources for the benefit of the trust’s members. While the specific 
motivations of those setting up a data trust will vary in different contexts, data trusts are characterised by 
their focus on: 
● enabling  data-driven  innovation  for  social  and  economic  benefit,  by  creating  a  trustworthy  
environment for data sharing. 
● re-balancing power asymmetries in data exchanges, by encouraging and empowering the originators 
of the data to play an active role in setting the terms of data use –   and the distribution of the value 
that creates –   and providing a platform for collective negotiation; and 
● anticipating,  preventing,  and  managing  the  vulnerabilities  associated  with  data  use,  through  
professional data stewardship. 
In a statement earlier this year, GPAI set out some of the core functions of data trusts, based on discussions 
amongst Working Group members.
1
 This explored the distinctive contribution that data trusts can make to 
data stewardship: by offering a vehicle for individuals or groups to choose how they want data about them to 
be used and engaging a trustee to act for their benefit, data trusts can provide a mechanism for bottom-up 
engagement that empowers individuals and communities in decisions about data use. That statement also 
highlighted  some  of  the  challenges  associated  with  creating  real-world  data trusts:  from  identifying  
community needs to creating strategies for implementation.  
T
o  help  understand  current  strategies  for  operationalising  data  trusts  and  the  role  of  different  legal  
frameworks  enabling  their  development,  GPAI  has  commissioned  the  Aapti  Institute  and  the  Open  Data  
                                                      
1 These functions are: provide a platform for collectives to establish desirable terms and conditions of data use, setting the constitution of a trust; appoint expert 
trustees (professional managers) to take responsibility for the stewardship of the trust’s assets, create a regime of strong fiduciary responsibilities to bind the trustees 
to act in the interests of the trust’s members; negotiate use of trust assets in accordance with agreed terms and conditions, facilitating safe and controlled data use; 
and establish safeguards and oversight mechanisms to prevent data misuse and to take remedial action in the event of the trust’s terms and conditions being 
breached.

Institute  (ODI)  to  produce  two  new  reports,  now  published  for  consultation.  A  survey  of  current  data  trust  
projects by the ODI and Aapti Institute collates experiences from 45 practitioners and researchers, presenting 
their views on what functions data trusts are delivering and what operational strategies help deliver them. In 
parallel, the Aapti Institute’s review of legal frameworks synthesises recent legal and policy developments 
surrounding data trusts, comparing the experiences of 11 different jurisdictions.  
We  hope  these  reports  will  contribute  to  a  continuing  conversation  about  the  potential  of  data  trusts  in  
enabling data sharing for social benefit. To support that dialogue, this summary presents key messages from 
these two interim outputs.  
Lessons from current practice 
A  community  of  research  and  practice  is  already  growing  around  data  trusts.  This  community  is  trialling  
alternative approaches to data stewardship, with the aim of empowering individuals and communities. It is 
also changing and growing at pace, as new projects start up and grow –   80% of projects surveyed were less 
than 5 years old or yet to be operational –   and as research and policy debates evolve. 
While the last few years might have been characterised by a proliferation of projects using the term ‘data 
trust’  in  different  ways,  survey  responses  suggest  that  the  community  is  moving  towards  a  shared  
understanding  of  what  data  trusts  are,  and  how  they  differ  from  other  forms  of  stewardship.  82%  of  
respondents agreed with the definition of data trusts that GPAI proposed in our statement earlier this year
. 
Those disagreeing raised helpful questions about how terms like ‘data producers’ and ‘fiduciary duties’ will 
be  interpreted  in  different  contexts,  but  were  broadly  in  alignment  with  the  idea  that  data  trusts  play  a  
distinctive  role  in  creating  an  environment  for  enhanced  accountability,  while  empowering  individuals  and  
communities. 
The review of working practices produced by the ODI and Aapti Institute highlights a range of innovations in 
stewardship practice that are being used by different initiatives to operationalise data trusts: 
● Practitioners  are  using  different  legal  frameworks,  including  limited  companies,  foundations,  non-
profits,  and  cooperatives,  adapting  to  the  opportunities  and  challenges  associated  with  the  legal  
environment in which they operate. 
● Technologies being deployed to manage data vary across projects, with examples of data ‘pods’, 
‘vaults’, ‘personal data stores’ and distributed ledger-based services playing a role in operationalising 
data management strategies. Practitioners also highlighted the role that Application Programming 
Interfaces play in helping connect data across organisations and the potential for privacy enhancing 
technologies to support the wider data sharing ecosystem.  
● Different business models are emerging from efforts to make current projects financially sustainable 
over  the  long-term.  While  many  early-stage  projects  are  reliant  on  philanthropic  funding,  public  
funding,  private  investment  – or  other  non-earned  revenue  streams  – other  emerging  business  
models use membership fees, data access fees, or data insights packages to generate revenue.  
● With the aim of facilitating bottom-up engagement in decisions about data use, initiatives have been 
developing different forms of participatory and delegated decision-making. These span a spectrum 
from  individual-focused  (for  example,  seeking  consent  from  individual  members  to  include  – or 
withdraw –   their data from specific use cases), to cooperative negotiations.  
This  diversity  of  practices  is  allowing  projects  to  deliver  many  of  the  core  functions  of  a  data  trust,  while  
adapting to local conditions. Projects included in this review typically reported delivering four or five of the six 
core  data  trust  functions,  with  many  focusing  on  providing  a  platform  to  pool  data  while  establishing  
safeguards  and oversight  mechanisms  around  data  use.  In  one  area,  however,  a  clear  gap  is  emerging  
between theory and practice: the role of trustees in enabling data stewardship remains a difficult aspect of 
data  trusts  to  operationalise.  With  trustees  expected  to  play  an  important  role  in  increasing  accountability  
and enforcing safeguards around data use, this gap has implications for both how data trusts can work today, 
and how the field might develop in future.

Implications for policymakers 
The Aapti Institute’s review of global legal frameworks also highlights a diversity of policy approaches towards 
data stewardship across the globe. Countries differ in: the extent to which their current legislation provides 
data rights for individuals or communities, the ways in which those rights – where they exist –   can be enacted 
through data institutions; and in their ability to support or enforce fiduciary relationships between parties in a 
data sharing arrangement.  
Examining how legislation can facilitate data stewardship and bottom-up empowerment, this interim report 
identifies three legislative building blocks for data trusts and other data intermediaries. These are: 
● Data rights and protections: Data trusts are a tool to help citizens enact their rights; a prerequisite 
for their operationalisation is the existence of clear and robust data rights within a jurisdiction. These 
rights  might  include  data  portability,  findability,  and  accessibility  – legal  provisions  that  give  
individuals  rights  over  use  of  data  about  them  – and  may  need  to  be  extended  to  include  rights  
around community data or co-generated data. If data trusts are to operate effectively, these rights 
also need to be managed in a way that allows the trustee to act on behalf of the trust’s members, 
raising legal questions about how to delegate or mandate rights to a trust.  
● Data  sharing  policies:  A  range  of  different  legal  agreements  and  frameworks  play  a  role  in  
supporting the data sharing ecosystem in which data trusts operate. Some of these are explored in 
the  interim  report,  including  data  standards,  data  formats,  sector-specific  policy  frameworks  and  
other data sharing agreements. The ability of data trusts to facilitate data use will depend in part on 
the effectiveness of this wider environment.   
● Fiduciary obligations: Definitions of fiduciary responsibilities vary across countries. Under common 
law, fiduciary duties can be used to create safeguards around data trusts –   they would require data 
trustees to act in the best interests of the trust’s members, and are associated with high levels of 
accountability and loyalty for those trustees. In other jurisdictions, different strategies will be needed 
to implement such requirements, ensuring data trusts remain trustworthy. Such actions may include 
regulation, opportunities for judicial intervention, or other policy action. 
Recent years have already seen attempts by governments to develop policy or regulatory frameworks that 
can facilitate the development of data intermediaries. While the framework presented in the Aapti Institute’s 
report is still in development, policymakers can look to these building blocks as a framework for assessing 
data trust-readiness. Important questions to consider in the next phase of developing the policy environment 
will include: 
● Are existing data rights sufficient?  
● What types of data sharing infrastructure are needed to underpin data trusts? 
● Do existing legal frameworks provide sufficient safeguards to ensure data trusts remain trustworthy? 
 
 

7 
 
Next steps 
Together, these interim reviews show both the progress that has been made in advancing data trust research 
and practice over the last five years, and the progress that is needed to operationalise the vision behind data 
trusts. They raise interesting questions at the interface of data trust research and practice, including: 
● What support do practitioners need to operationalise real-world data trusts? What new operational 
strategies can help deliver all the core functions of data trusts? 
● In  what  areas  are  there  significant,  unrealised  opportunities  for  creating  data  trusts  that  benefit  
people and society? 
● What data rights and data sharing infrastructures must be in place to enable data trusts to operate? 
Where legal interventions are not available, what alternative strategies can work in their place? 
● What  interventions  can  help  ensure  that  data  trusts  remain  trustworthy?  As  our  understanding  of  
core  concepts  – like  fiduciary  responsibilities,  co-generated  rights  and  collective  interests  around  
data use –   evolves, what changes to legal or operational frameworks might be needed?  
Part of the appeal of data trusts as a stewardship model is their flexibility –   their ability to adapt to local needs 
and opportunities. The diversity of working practices and policy approaches explored in the interim reports 
that GPAI is publishing today in collaboration with the Aapti Institute and ODI offer opportunities for taking 
stock of what the data trusts community has learned so far, and how it might continue to develop in future.  
These reports are the first outputs from GPAI’s data trusts workstrand. In the coming months, we’ll continue 
to work with the Aapti Institute and the Open Data Institute to refine their findings and identify the lessons 
that can inform future practice and policy development. We hope they can start a conversation with the data 
trusts community –   if you’d like to provide feedback on the reports, please get in touch via info@ceimia.org. 
If successful, data trusts could fill an important gap in the data stewardship landscape. By providing a space 
for meaningful community engagement and participation, they could help connect our aspirations for data 
sharing for social good with the imperative to avoid the harms associated with untrustworthy data use. We 
look forward to hearing your views about what we can learn from experiences of creating data trusts so far, 
and how the community might develop in future.

Executive Summary 
Progress in artificial intelligence (AI) requires access to data. Who shares data, for what purposes and 
under what conditions will therefore shape the development of AI and the challenges it is put to.  
However, many organisations currently regard data as something to hoard, causing it to be inaccessible to 
those who could otherwise use it to create new products or insights. At the same time, a lack of involvement 
of individuals and communities in shaping how data is used will deny beneficial uses of data, due to 
people withdrawing their consent -  in the broad sense - f  or its collection and sharing. 
In response, data stewardship has emerged as a responsible, rights-preserving and participatory concept. 
It  aims  to  unlock  the  economic  and  societal  value  of  data,  while  upholding  the  rights  of  individuals  and  
communities to participate in decisions relating to its collection, management and use. 
In this context, this research set out to understand global knowledge, attitudes and practices of data 
trusts. It  was  undertaken  for  the  Global  Partnership  on  AI  (GPAI)  by  Aapti  and  the  Open  Data  Institute  
between  August  and  October  2021,  using  a  combination  of  literature  review,  survey  and  case  studies.  It  
adopted the GPAI’s Data Governance Working Group interpretation of data trusts as: 
 
“a form of data stewardship that supports data producers to pool their data (or data rights) with the 
aim  of  collectively  negotiating  terms  of  use  with  potential  data  users,  through  the  oversight  by  
independent  trustees,  with  fiduciary  duties,  and  within  a  framework  of  technical,  legal  and  policy  
interventions that facilitate data use and provide strong safeguards against mis-use”. 
 
The project’s literature review (Section 2) found significant theory, interest and experimentation around new 
forms  of  ‘bottom-up’  data  stewardship  that  seek  to  empower  people  to  participate  in  the  process  of  data  
collection, use and sharing. The analysis frames data trusts as a particular, evolving form of bottom-up data 
stewardship. It found emerging consensus on distinctive features of data trusts and that practitioners deploy 
a variety of operational strategies to realise its functions. 
A survey (Section 3) was completed by 45 people building or running data trusts and similar bottom-up data 
stewardship initiatives, or who are working on data stewardship and related topics. Analysis of the survey 
(summarised in Section 5) found that: 
● today’s data stewardship projects deliver many of the functions associated with data trusts, 
but delivering all the functions attributed to a data trust, as per the GPAI Data Governance Working 
Group’s interpretation, remains a challenge 
● there  is  general  optimism  about  the  potential  of  data  trusts  among  people  working  on  data  
stewardship. 
● the interest in data trusts as a form of data stewardship seems to be concentrated in Europe and 
North America. 
● There are a number of real-world initiatives that demonstrate multiple routes to realising bottom-up 
data stewardship that do not follow the data-trust definition or deliver all of the functions associated 
with data trusts. 
● The purpose for bottom-up data stewardship can differ significantly, from supporting altruism 
to generating commercial return and this defines how models design their governance mechanisms. 
The  case  studies  (Section  4)  document  three  bottom-up  data  stewardship  initiatives:  Driver’s  Seat,  Open  
Humans and MIDATA. They represent real-world examples of how groups can be empowered around 
data they’ve generated and are actively making available data for broad societal benefit. 
The intent is for this report to act as a reference point on the subject of data trusts for practitioners seeking 
inspiration, as well as policymakers, funders and other enabling actors considering how to support the field.

The emergence of data trusts
 
● This section presents a review of literature on data stewardship and the evolution of the 
concept of data trusts, discussing the work of Sylvie Delacroix and Neil Lawrence, Sean 
McDonald and other scholars, and organisations such as the Mozilla Data Futures Lab and 
the Ada Lovelace Institute. 
● The review documents significant theory, interest and experimentation around new forms 
of ‘bottom-up’ data stewardship that seek to empower people to participate in the process 
of data collection, use and sharing. 
● The review frames data trusts as a particular, evolving form of bottom-up data stewardship, 
and found rapid proliferation around the use of the term among practitioners and scholars 
of stewardship.   
● While  there  is  divergent  opinion  from  around  the  world  on  how  data  trusts  could  be  
constructed,  the  stewardship  community  is  nevertheless  working  to  consolidate  their  
understanding of the term. 
1.1. Data stewardship 
The effective collection, use and sharing of data can help address the pressing challenges of our time -  from 
surfacing remedies for climate change
2
 to improving public health
3
. 
The transformative power of data is best explained through the lens of examples such as the Human Genome 
Project, undertaken between 1990 and 2003.
4
 Led by the US Government’s National Institute of Health, the 
Project made available data on DNA sequencing within 24 hours of its discovery. The consequent availability 
of  that  data  for  research  and  development  has  not  only  saved  lives,  but  also  generated  $796  billion  in  
economic  impact  and  supported  over  300,000  jobs  in  2010  alone.
5
  More recently,  the  same  data  sharing  
norms  established  by  the  Human  Genome  Project  (the  ‘Bermuda  principle’”)
6
  were  adopted  in  the  
development  of  vaccines  against  SARS-COV-2.
7
  A  lab  in  China  released  the  genome  sequence  of  the  
coronavirus  in  January  2020,  which  was  subsequently  used  by  researchers  around  the  world  to  develop  
antidotes, even without access to physical genomic samples of the virus.  
H
owever, despite the positive benefits of data, the emergence of new approaches to its collection, use and 
sharing -   particularly  driven  by  developments  in  machine  learning
8
  -    is  underpinned  by  two  disconcerting  
trends.

First, the market-driven imperatives of corporations have helped create digital enclosures
9
 that hampers the 
ability to use data for broad-based social benefit. Much of the current data economy is defined by a paradigm 
of  extraction
10
,  whereby  the  role  of  individuals  and  communities  as  the  generators  of  data  goes  
unrecognised.
11
  This  process  of  has  been  described  varingly  as  the  “attention  economy”,
12
  “surveillance 
capitalism”
13
 and “computational capitalism”
14
, with corporations’ use of data existing beyond the control of 
those individuals and communities.
15
 For instance, patients signing-up to digital health applications have little 
knowledge  of  who  has  access  to  their  data  and  how  it  will  be  used,
16
  just  as  rideshare  drivers  in  the  gig  
economy are excluded from the management of algorithms that govern their work.
17
 
Second, a lack of consideration of ethics and equity, and a lack of engagement with those affected by data’s 
use, undermines trust in the process of data sharing. In the UK, the Government came under scrutiny for its 
GP Data for Planning and Research (GPDPR) proposal, which would facilitate access to the health records 
of 55 million people.
18
 The proposal has been indefinitely postponed, having been subject to criticism for not 
giving patients a meaningful say in how the system should work.
19
 Equally, high profile data breaches such 
as the 2017 Equifax data breach, where an unauthorized third party gained access to data on as many as 
143 million Americans, serve to erode the trust we have as consumers in the processing of data about us.
20
  
These  trends  have  given  rise  to  inter-related  phenomena  - ‘data  hoarding’  and  ‘data  fearing’
21
.  ‘ Data 
hoarding’ relates to a scenario where organisations restrict access to data due to misperceptions about its 
value to their operations or the risks associated with data sharing. The benefits of data collection and use 
would only be enjoyed by a few, while the negative impacts of its use would affect society as a whole.
22
 On 
the other end is the scenario of ‘data fearing’, where data might not be collected or used to the extent it could, 
due to concerns about the harm that it can cause people being left unaddressed. People might avoid using 
services, or withdraw consent for data to be collected, which means that we end up missing data and the 
uses of it that could support human flourishing. 
The concept of data stewardship is a response to these ‘data hoarding’ and ‘data fearing’ scenarios. Data 
stewardship  can  be  understood  as  an  approach  to  data  governance  that  is  responsible,  rights-preserving 
and  participatory  in  nature
23
.  In  effect,  data  stewardship  aims  to  unlock  the  societal  value  of  data,  while  
upholding the data rights of individuals and communities to participate in decisions relating to its collection, 
management and use.

1.2. Bottom-up data stewardship 
Corporations, governments and civil society organisations find themselves occupying powerful positions in 
determining how data is put to use. However, within most current mechanisms for data collection, use and 
sharing, the involvement of individuals and communities is non-existent. 
In response, a more empowering paradigm of ‘bottom-up data stewardship’ has emerged. It builds on the 
ideals of data stewardship, recognising individuals and communities as more than recipients of information - 
or  mere  providers  of  consent  -   about  how  data  about  them  is  used
25
,  and  seeks  to  empower  them  to  
participate in the process of data collection, use and sharing.  
A
n ecosystem of research and practice has emerged around this concept of ‘bottom-up data stewardship’. 
The MyData Global community, for example, is set out “to empower individuals by improving their right to 
self-determination regarding their personal data”
26
. The Mozilla Data Futures Lab was launched in 2021 to 
support experimentation around “new approaches to data stewardship that give greater control and agency 
to people”
27
. The Ada Lovelace Institute advocates for ‘participatory data stewardship’, where people whose 
data is used or about which data decisions are taken are meaningfully involved.
28
 Aapti Institute’s work at 
the  Data  Economy  Lab
29
  aims  to  empower  individuals  and  communities  to  play  a  bigger  part  in  data  
governance, and it has documented numerous examples of this in practice.
30
 
R
esearch suggests that the bottom-up data stewardship initiatives emerging from this  ecosystem can be 
functionally  very  different,  especially  in  terms  of  the  types  of  involvement  they  afford  to  individuals  and  
communities
31
.  Some  initiatives  - such  as  Bitsabout.me
32
  - enable  people  to  make  granular,  individual  
decisions about who has access to data about them, for what purposes and in exchange for what;
33
 other 
initiatives -  such  as  Salus.coop
34
  and  others  described  below  - enable  people  to  participate  in  collective  
decision-making as part of a community;
35
 and a few initiatives -  such as Jumbo
36
 -   enable people to delegate 
another  party  to  mediate  data  collection  and  use.
37
  Research  on  bottom-up  data  stewardship  has  also  
demonstrated  the  array  of  other  ways  such  initiatives  can  differ.
38
    Aapti’s  Stewardship  Mapper
39
,  which  
draws on interviews and analysis of 100+ bottom-up data stewardship initiatives, describes nine categories 
of ‘design choices’ practitioners can make in constituting them, from business models to technical features. 
I
n particular, a number of promising initiatives have emerged to enable groups to generate or repurpose data 
about them, and exert collective control over it for a common purpose. For instance: 
● Variant Bio

iljoen’s 2020 paper articulates the rationale for reorienting power relationships within the digital economy in 
favour of communities and to enable them to exercise meaningful control over their data
46
. The paper argues 
that  the  process  of  data  collection,  use  and  sharing  requires  reworking  on  account  of  its  social  effects,  
whereby “personal choices over data sharing should reflect the effects this choice has on others, not only 
because of the political and moral benefits of considering others, but also because under current conditions 
of  datafication”.
47
  It  also  builds  on  Elinor  Ostrom’s  ground-breaking  research  on  the  governance  of  lakes,  
forests  and  other  common  pool  resources,  which  demonstrates  how  communities  can  forge  institutional  
frameworks to govern their use in a sustainable and mutually beneficial manner. The resultant theory of self-
regulation  by  communities  - termed  Ostrom’s  design  principles  - holds  invaluable  insights  for  assigning  
collective rights over data.
48
 
Overall, bottom-up  data  stewardship  represents  an  opportunity  to  subvert  existing  patterns  of  storing  and  
sharing data
49
, empowering groups to play an active role in deciding how and the purposes for which data 
can be used.

Data justice: A social justice agenda for the digital age  
Growing datafication is a significant feature of contemporaneous capitalism, such that human and 
economic development have come to be governed by digital footprints that people leave in the 
wake of their interactions with technology. Consequently, the ways in which data is processed by 
corporations and governments affect not only the organisation of information, but also people’s 
access to services and ultimately, their autonomy itself. 
Scholars such as Linnet Taylor
51
 have draw attention to the “structural dicrimination” inherent to 
intensifying  datafication,  such  that  institutions  of  the  state  (through  population  databases  and  
surveillance)  and  corporations  (as  dominant  entities  with  accumulated  data  and  processing  
abilities)  function  to  amplify  exclusion  and  disempowerment  of  individuals  and  communities.  
Elsewhere, Lina Dencik and Anne Kaun
52
 illustrate the debilitating impact of datafication on the 
welfare state, leaving citizens with limited bargaining power and agency to control the use of their 
data.  
I
n such a milieu, reconstituting the conventional agenda of social justice becomes crucial to forge 
ethical pathways to regulate datafication. Data justice is an expression of this impulse, making 
“fairness  in  the  way  people  are  made  visible,  represented  and  treated  as  a  result  of  their  
production  of  digital  data”  as  crucial  considerations  that  should  guide  policy  and  regulation  on  
data.  
1.3. Data trusts: an evolving conceptual framework 
The  concept  of  ‘data  trusts’  has  evolved  from  this  backdrop  of  bottom-up  data  stewardship.  The  idea  of  
extracting  value  from  data  and  restructuring  its  distribution  through  the  use  of  data  trusts  was  posited  by  
Professor Neil Lawrence in 2016,
53
 whereby data trusts could act as “power brokers” to mediate the use of 
data for public benefit, without compromising the rights of data subjects to whom the data relates.  
S
ubsequently, Delacroix and Lawrence articulated ‘bottom-up data trusts’ in 2019
54
 as a tool of collective 
engagement  used  by  communities  to  decide  on  how  their  data  is  used  and  shared  by  third  parties.  They  
described  how  trustees  could  be  bound  by  fiduciary  obligations  of  undivided  loyalty  and  care  towards  its  
beneficiaries, defining the terms for purpose-led data sharing. It set out use cases to outline the advantages 
of the approach in different contexts. For example, in the context of social media and financial information, 
data trusts could have a role to play in negotiating terms on behalf of data subjects to ensure data could be 
made available for research and public policy purposes. 
T
he  Data  Trusts  Initiative  builds  on  this  conception  of  data  trusts.  It  describes  them  as  a  “mechanism  for  
individuals  to  pool  their  data  rights  into  an  organisation”
55
,  with  i)  independent  stewardship  of  the  pooled  
rights, ii) fiduciary responsibilities, iii) operations guided by a framework of institutional safeguards and iv) 
the  facilitating  of  collective  action.
56
    This  conception  of  the  data  trust  seeks  to  rebalance  the  respective 
control  that  corporations  and  individuals  have  over  personal  data,  and  provide  a  legal  mechanism  to  
empower data subjects to choose to appoint others to make those decisions on their behalf. As a Mozilla

Fellow, Anouk Ruhaak is also working on scenarios where multiple people ‘hand over their data assets or 
data rights to a trustee’, such as data donation platforms that allow users of web browsers to donate data on 
their usage of different services.
57
 
Similarly, Aapti’s interpretation of a data trust refers to “a legal arrangement wherein a person authorises an 
individual or entity to manage certain property for the benefit of a third party or for certain defined purposes”.
58
 
In the context of the data economy, the data (or rights over it) constitutes the property
59
 that will be managed 
by the trust and the trustee (authorised representative individual or entity) is bound by fiduciary obligations 
to act in the best interests of its beneficiaries and according to the defined purposes.  
A
nother major work outlining the potential function of data trusts is that of McDonald and Wylie
60
. Their work 
describes  the  potential  for  data  trusts  in  consumer  protection  and  fiduciary  governance  for  the  data  
economy.
61
  It  argues  that  the  data  trust,  a  legal  arrangement  where  a  trustee  is  appointed  with  fiduciary  
obligations towards a specified beneficiary, is suited to creating predictable data supply chains with increased 
accountability. 
A
s a model of bottom-up data stewardship, data trusts represent a compelling instrument to unlock data for 
public benefit uses within a framework of fiduciary duties, such that data sharing decisions are compliant with 
the interests and rights of communities.
62
 As the Global Partnership for AI has itself described, they offer the 
potential to “expand access to data for innovation while putting citizen interests at the heart of stewardship”.
63
  
1.4. Differing interpretations of data trusts  
There has been a lack of consistent, global interpretation of data trusts among scholars, policymakers and 
other actors, reflecting the nascent nature of the research and practice of bottom-up data stewardship. 
India’s proposed framework for the governance of non-personal data recommends the appointment of data 
trustees as representatives to steward community data and channel its use for socially beneficial purposes 
such  as  entrepreneurship,  innovation,  research  and  policymaking.
64
  Similarly,  Ontario  state  authorities  in  
Canada are exploring legal mechanisms to establish data trusts that would enable ‘privacy-protective data 
sharing’.
65
 
The  European  Commission’s  proposed  Data  Governance  Act,  2020  outlines  a  framework  for  “data  
intermediaries” -  entities which provide “data sharing services” that “contribute to the efficient pooling of data 
as well as to the facilitation of bilateral data sharing”.
66
   Although the Act does not explicitly identify a specific 
category or type of data intermediary, scholars have put forth data trusts as possible mechanisms to promote 
enfranchisement and meaningful realisation of data rights of subjects within the EU.

In the UK, a 2018 report by Hall and Pesenti called for the creation of data trusts as a “trusted and proven 
framework” to increase the availability and use of data for growing the domestic AI industry.
68
 Other research 
subsequently interpreted data trusts as ‘providing independent fiduciary stewardship of data’, building on the 
work  of  Porcaro  and  others  that  had  imagined  organisations  “[putting]  their  user-data  in  some  form  of  
irrevocable, spendthrift-esque ‘data trust’, which would then be managed by a third-party trustee (a nonprofit, 
for instance)”. Using this interpretation, the ODI undertook pilot projects to generate insights on the potential 
application of data trusts in the contexts of food waste management, wildlife poaching and urban mobility.
69
 
It  has  also  observed  UK  Biobank,  OpenCorporates  and  Oversight  Board  as  examples  of  independent,  
fiduciary stewardship of data applied in practice
70
. 
This interpretation is adopted elsewhere. Based in the US, PLACE describes itself as a data trust for creating, 
storing and accessing mapping data, governed by independent trustees drawn from different geographies 
and sectors
71
. Johns Hopkins Medicine has similarly been described as having ‘a data trust administrator’, 
responsible for  retaining    patient  privacy  while  enabling  medical  records  to  be  used  to  improve  care  and  
facilitate research
72
. Toronto’s experience with a proposal to set up a ‘civic data trust’ is another example 
that worked to this interpretation.
73
 In 2019, Sidewalk Labs proposed setting up a civic data trust to govern 
data generated by sensors and cameras around the neighbourhood that would be developed. Ultimately, the 
project was abandoned in 2020 citing unprecedented economic uncertainty but perhaps mostly due to local 
opposition to the development plans. 
T
his research works to a definition based on the Global Partnership for AI’s consensus statement, whereby 
a data trust is “a form of data stewardship that supports data producers to pool their data (or data rights) with 
the aim of collectively negotiating terms of use with potential data users, through the oversight by independent 
trustees, with fiduciary duties, and within a framework of technical, legal and policy interventions that facilitate 
data use and provide strong safeguards against mis-use”. This interpretation is aligned with the concept as 
put forward by Lawrence and Delacroix in their paper on ‘bottom-up data trusts’ and as adopted by the Data 
Trusts Initiative. It marries the conception of groups of individuals coming together to contribute data within 
the framework of independent fiduciaries duties. 
1.5. Institutionalising data trusts and codifying fiduciary responsibilities 
There has been significant discussion around the challenge of institutionalising the data (or data rights) to be 
held and managed by data trusts, and codifying the fiduciary responsibilities of trustees. 
Establishing data trusts involves the pooling of data, or data rights, and the exertion of control over these 
data  (rights)  by  a  trustee.  Data  rights  enshrined  within  legislation  are  therefore  a  prerequisite  for  their  
development.
74
 Over the past decade, we have seen the introduction of significant new data protection laws 
globally that represent the basis of a data rights framework. Jurisdictions in Canada have implemented data 
protection legislations at the federal
75
 and provincial levels,
76
 with Ghana close behind in enacting its Data 
Protection Act, 2012.
77
 The most significant step towards articulation of data rights is the EU’s General Data 
Protection Regulation, 2016
78
 which sought to impose controls on data processing, rooted in principles of 
individual harm, rights and privacy. This has spurred a flurry of personal data protection regulations that have

among others. 
However,  despite  alignment  between  some  regions,  there  remain  significant  variations    in  the  data  rights  
afforded by different jurisdictions. In addition to these variances, it is important to note that the manner in 
which  specific  rights  - such  as  the  right  to  data  portability,  which  is  crucial  to  support  bottom-up  data  
stewardship -  are enforced differ across legal regimes. Further complications arise for jurisdictions that do 
not have an operative data protection legislation and consequently, provide little clarity on the data rights of 
citizens.
83
 Therefore, the feasibility of data trusts will be a function of the extent and nature of data rights 
afforded by the relevant legal jurisdiction, and the way those rights are enforced. This dynamic is explored 
further in legal research undertaken by Aapti in parallel to the research described by this report. 
Enabling data sharing for social benefit through data trusts: Legal review 
In addition to the present research, Aapti was commissioned by GPAI to examine the existing and 
necessary legal mechanisms required to develop data trusts. To do so, the researchers undertook 
a rigorous process of comparative legal analysis across 11 jurisdictions to draw out variations in 
data protection laws and rights, data sharing frameworks and fiduciary obligations -  all of which 
constitute essential legislative underpinnings of a data trust.  
The resultant comparative analysis throws up several key insights that demonstrate disparity in 
maturity  of  legal  landscapes  for  data  trusts  around  the  globe,  and  point  to  the  need  for  
administrative and legislative investments in data governance in several countries. Further, it was 
found  that  for  legal  systems  which  do  not  embed  fiduciary  duties  matching  common  law  
structures,  there  may  be  a  need  to  explore  diverse  structures  for  enabling  human-centric  data  
governance. Key takeaways from this research have been summarised below: 
● Disparity across nations and lack of digital infrastructure: Given the diversity -  both 
economic  and  political  - of  the  jurisdictions  analysed,  it  was  found  that  the  maturity  in  
articulating  rights  over  data  varied  significantly.  This  includes  regulatory  measures  like  
standardisation of data formats or sharing purpose, enabling interoperability, or introducing 
digital public infrastructure.  
● Personal data rights and building for autonomy: Even within some of the countries with 
more robust digital infrastructures, the absence  of certain personal data rights -  such as 
access,  portability  and  erasure  -   pose  challenges  in  creating  a  sustainable  data  trust  
ecosystem. For instance, Canada, Australia, and South Korea, while faring well on digital 
infrastructure, have yet to recognise clear data portability rights.  
● Legislative  implementation  and  regulatory  oversight:  Legal  concepts  which  may  be  
common  across  jurisdictions  are  not  always  implemented  uniformly.  For  instance,  the  
extent of adoption of trusts in Kenya and South Africa -  countries with common law origins 
-  is not as crystalised as compared to jurisdictions such as England, which extensively use 
trusts for a variety of commercial and non-commercial purposes.  
● A ‘data trust conundrum’ for stewardship: It is evident that the conception of data trusts 
is  most  fundamentally  rooted  in  English  trust  law.  Based  on  this  analysis,  even  in  
jurisdictions  that  have  common  law  influence  and  recognise  trusts,  the  evolution  of  its  
concepts have not mirrored the English experience.

In the past, the role of fiduciaries in the context of data stewardship has generally been limited to ensuring 
compliance -  that is determining whether grounds for processing of data are in accordance with applicable 
regulations.
84
 However, this conception of ‘trustees’ holding broader and more explicit fiduciary duties that 
compel  them  to  act  in  the  best  interests  of  data  producers  has  started  to  be  discussed  within  the  data  
governance ecosystem. This renewed approach to the duties of “trustees” has its roots in the stewardship of 
common  pool  resources,  such  as  Scotland’s  ports  trusts.
85
  With  myriad  activities  - from  fisheries  
management  to  renewable  energy  generation  -   being  undertaken,  the  ports  are  managed  through  a  trust  
framework  set  through  an  act  of  law  of  the  Parliament.  These  trust  ports  are  governed  by  a  stakeholder-
representative board comprising users of the port, members of the local community, government agencies 
and follows a democratic model of decision-making. The trust framework helps balance various perspectives 
and interests while generating valuable income for regional and national economies; at the heart of the trust 
port model is the fiduciary duty of loyalty and care which mandates trustees to act in the best interest of its 
stakeholders.
86
 
Sean McDonald
87
 has expanded on the application of explicit, contextual fiduciary duties to the governance 
of data, describing data trusts as a tool to hold companies accountable for their decisions and the promises 
made to users. In this view, data trusts offer a credible legal container for articulating fiduciary accountability 
and establishing processes to enable the right of redress.  
T
he  concept  of  information  fiduciaries
88
  proposed  by  Balkin  also  provides  a  seminal  analysis  of  fiduciary  
duties. It has, however, been subject to criticism,
89
 chiefly in that the approach fails to take cognisance of the 
entrenched  business  models  that  drive  diverging  interests  between  end  users  and  data  processors.  
According to this criticism, users are not adequately equipped by platforms and data processors in order to 
express  and  act  on  their  interests,  which  is  not  changed  by  the  imposition  of  fiduciary  duties  on  data  
processors. Also, as fiduciary obligations are normally settled by courts, the cost of solving each dispute on 
violation of fiduciary obligations may prove to be too much for users as well as the legal system to bear.
90
 
Divergent  views  have  also  been  expressed  as  to  the  legal  forms  most  suitable  for  data  trusts  to  take  to  
‘house’ the data (rights) contributed by data subjects, and to codify the fiduciary responsibilities of its trustees. 
In the UK, the ODI worked with a legal consortium on its initial pilots who argued that the mechanism of trust 
law was ‘inappropriate’ for constructing data trusts, largely on the basis that data cannot be made the property 
of  a  trust  under  existing  law
91
.  This  statement  was  subsequently  challenged  by  the  legal  community.  In  
October  2019,  Professor  Ben  McFarlane  of  University  of  Oxford  questioned  this  finding,  suggesting  that  
people’s rights over data, such as those conferred by the General Data Protection Regulation, rather than 
data itself, could be made the property of a legal trust and asserted collectively by its trustees.
92
 A similar 
argument has been made by Sylvie Delacroix and Neil Lawrence, who have suggested that while there are 
challenges, they ‘do not constitute reasons to doubt that data rights can be held under a legal Trust’. A paper 
published in the National University of Singapore Faculty of Law’s journal similarly found that ‘the traditional 
trust, the historical creation of English Equity jurisprudence and now found around the world, is a perfectly 
sensible vehicle for the management of data’.

The use of alternate legal forms to construct data trusts may be appropriate in jurisdictions that do not follow 
the common law tradition. For example, Germany does not have a trust law framework, but nonetheless has 
institutional forms such as the Sparkassen (cooperative or not-for-profit banks) that carry fiduciary obligations 
ascribed to the common law trust. And in Quebec, a civil law jurisdiction, the Quebec trust enables data rights 
to  be  pooled  and  administered  by  a  trustee,  which  has  sparked  widespread  excitement  around  the  
opportunity.
94
 These examples indicate the difference in legal structures being experimented with in different 
legal jurisdictions in order to facilitate the development of data trusts.

2.  International  knowledge,  attitudes  and  practices  of  data  
trusts 
● This  section  describes  the  results  of  a  survey  to  understand  knowledge  (awareness  and  
understanding), attitudes (perspective) and practices (implementation) of data trusts around 
the world. 
● Respondents  included  those  operating  data  trusts  or  similar  bottom-up  data  stewardship 
initiatives, and organisations working on the topic of data stewardship. 
● The survey: surfaced awareness of and optimism towards the concept of data trusts; found 
general agreement with the definition put forward by GPAI; found no projects delivering all the 
functions of real-world data trusts through one vehicle but a number of similar bottom-up data 
stewardship initiatives that were delivering many of the functions; and encountered a variety 
of legal forms and technologies used to construct the different initiatives.  
 
2.1. Context 
This  section  describes  the  results  of  a  survey  undertaken  to  understand  the  knowledge  about,  attitudes  
towards and practices of data trusts from around the world.  
The survey was divided into four sections. The first covered basic information about the respondent: their 
country of work, role and organisation name. The second sought their current understanding of data trusts, 
and included questions about the definition of data trusts and other forms of data stewardship. The survey 
then split into two parts, with one for completion by practitioners (people building or running data trusts, or 
similar bottom-up data stewardship initiatives) and the other for experts working on data stewardship and 
related topics. Practitioners were asked questions about how their initiatives work and whether they identified 
themselves as data trusts. Experts were asked about their perceptions of the current state of data trusts, and 
their thoughts about the future of the movement. In general, the survey combined structured and open-ended 
questions designed to enable quantitative analysis as well as space for respondents to elaborate their ideas. 
The survey was initially distributed by Aapti and ODI to around 100 practitioners and experts. It was also 
disseminated  through  social  media  platforms  and  newsletters,  the  GPAI  Working  Group,  and  snowballed  
through respondents sharing the survey themselves. At the close of the survey there were 45 responses. 
There was an even split between practitioners and experts, 22 and 23 respectively. Responses were heavily-
weighted towards Europe (and in particular from the UK), with nearly ¾ of all the respondents working there. 
The sectors that respondents described working from were technology and data, health and research. 
 
 

23 
 
2.2. Awareness and understanding 
The concept of data stewardship was a familiar topic for the respondents of the survey, as you might expect 
from practitioners and experts. Respondents were slightly less familiar with the idea of data trusts. 
 
 
Figure 1: Respondents familiarity with data stewardship and data trusts 
 
Beyond data trusts, our respondents were aware of a variety of other forms of data stewardship -  the most 
familiar  being  data  trusts,  data  commons,  and  data  exchanges.  The  familiarity  with  data  trusts  was  
unsurprising  given  the  focus  of  this  project.  Respondents  also  shared  examples  of  data  stewardship  that  
were not listed as prompts, such as statistics agencies and national bodies. 
As  the  literature  review  details,  there  are  varying  interpretations  of  data  trusts.  In  this  case,  82%  of  
respondents agreed with the GPAI definition of data trusts as “a form of data stewardship that allow data 
producers to pool their data (or data rights) and facilitate collective negotiation of terms of use with potential 
data  users,  working  through  independent  trustees  who  are  bound  by  strong  fiduciary  duties,  within  a  
framework of technical, legal and policy interventions that facilitate data use and provide strong safeguards 
against mis-use”. The respondents who did not agree with the definition offered a variety of interesting ideas 
and opinions. 
A  number  of  respondents  disagreed  with  the  language  used  in  the  GPAI  definition.  In  one  case,  the  
respondent felt that the who the trustees have a fiduciary duty to was missing, preferring the language of 
trustees “acting on behalf of the data subjects”. The respondent also described the need for data trusts to be 
working  towards  a  specific  purpose  and  felt  this  should  be  reflected  in  the  definition.  Other  respondents 
questioned the use of the term “data producer” and requested that the legal mechanism intended to create 
the fiduciary duties should be documented.  
A further contention made by respondents was whether the definition reflected a feasible reality. In particular, 
respondents questioned whether the imposition of fiduciary duties and technical, legal and policy safeguards 
was an ideal, and too high a bar to be met. One respondent preferred to talk about ‘data intermediaries’ and 
another described there not to be a need for an independent trustee. These responses perhaps represent 
something deeper than varying ideas for the definition of data trusts, and instead reflecting the existence and 
need for various forms of bottom-up data stewardship. 
  

24 
 
When asked to list examples of data trusts, respondents responded in three ways: 
● They gave examples of similar bottom-up data stewardship initiatives (the difference between these 
and data trusts is discussed below).  
● They gave theoretical examples of data trusts. 
●    They stated that they were not aware of any practical examples of data trusts. 
A number of examples given by respondents -  including Swash
95
 and MIDATA
96
 -   did not appear to have all 
of  the  functions  of  a  data  trust  set  out  by  the  GPAI  definition.  In  particular,  none  appeared  to  have  
independent trustees with fiduciary responsibilities. Other examples were not yet active, like the Liverpool 
Civic Data Cooperative
97
. Other examples were theoretical or abstract, such as ‘a Health Bank’, a theoretical 
data trust of residents of a housing block and mentions of the examples put forward by Sylvie Delacroix and 
Neil Lawrence’s paper
98
.   
2.3. Practices 
To find out about the practices of data trusts, part of the survey was targeted specifically to practitioners who 
are building or running data trusts. 
These questions focused on understanding how each initiative identified itself, their function and purpose, 
and included practical questions on their approach to data stewardship. There were 22 respondents to this 
part of the survey.  
In terms of identifying their initiatives, around a third of practitioners did not identify as data trusts. Within 
these  respondents,  we  observed  two  main  types  of  organisations.  The  first  consist  of  organisations  like  
Schluss & digi.me, who see themselves as the creators of infrastructure onto which data trusts can be built - 
for example by creating the technology for users to collect their data in a pod or vault. The second was formed 
of  organisations  with  similar  aims  to  the  concept  of  data  trusts,  as  put  forward  by  GPAI,  but  function  
differently.  For  example,  Swash  described  having  “built-in  trustless  structures”  rather  than  fiduciary  
responsibilities to achieve the outcome of empowering people with their data, and CSIRO detailed how they 
work to enable the aggregation of data for the common good but unlike data trusts, participating actors control 
what happens to the data rather than trustees. 
The survey asked practitioners to select which of the 6 functions, as per the GPAI definition of data trusts, 
their initiatives undertake, as follows: 
1.   Provide a platform for people to pool data. 
2.   Provide a platform for people to establish desirable terms and conditions of data use. 
3.   Negotiate  use  of  the  data  in  accordance  with  agreed  terms  and  conditions,  facilitating  safe  and  
controlled data use. 
4.   Appoint expert trustees to take responsibility for the stewardship of the data. 
5.   Create a regime of strong fiduciary responsibilities to bind the trustees to act in the interests of the 
data trust’s members.

6.   Establish safeguards and oversight mechanisms to prevent data misuse and to take remedial action 
in the event of the trust’s terms and conditions being breached. 
On average, the respondents stated that they had between four and five of the functions, with responses 
ranging from just one to the full six. 
 
 
Figure 2: “Which of the following functions does your initiatives have?” - question to data stewardship practitioners. 
 
There was a relatively even distribution across five of the six roles, with one function outlying: Appoint expert 
trustees to take responsibility for the stewardship of the data. This may reflect that the requirement to appoint 
expert trustees to oversee the stewardship of data may be one of the more difficult functions to achieve in 
practice. Conversely, providing a platform to pool data, and establishing safeguards over that data, appear 
some of the more common and achievable functions in practice.  
Seven respondents said their initiatives had all six of these functions, appearing to determine them as data 
trusts.  However,  of  these  seven:  the  name  of  one  of  these  was  not  given  (N/A);  two  were  not  yet  active  
(PLACE, Donate your Data Foundation); two instead develop technology for data trusts (Sightline Innovation, 
PolyPoly); and one preferred not to define as a data trust (DataYogi). This left one for us to examine further 
(Worker Info Exchange). 
Worker Info Exchange is a non profit organisation dedicated to helping workers access and gain insight from 
data collected from them at work.
99
 The project is relatively early stage, but is active and currently stewards 
data on behalf of gig workers. On their website, there is clear evidence they are providing a platform to pool 
data  and  establish  desirable  terms,  they  are  negotiating  safe  usage  of  their  users  data,  and  establishing  
safeguards  to  prevent  data  misuse.  However,  it  is  unclear  as  to  whether  there  are  any  data  trustees  and  
whether those trustees have fiduciary responsibilities to act in the best interests of their members. The lack 
of evidence means that for the purposes of this report, Worker Info Exchange is not considered a data trust.

Despite not meeting the GPAI definition, Worker Info Exchange is an excellent example of bottom-up data 
stewardship in practice
100
. 
The survey also asked experts about the frequency that they had seen the six functions of data trusts in their 
work.  
 
 
Figure 3: “In the data stewardship initiatives you have come across in your work, please select the frequency that you 
see the following features” - question to data stewardship experts. 
 
Two thirds of the experts had frequently seen initiatives providing a platform for individuals and groups to 
pool their data. The other 5 functions were rarely observed in a practical setting.  
The  survey  explored  how  bottom-up  data  stewardship  initiatives  function,  asking  respondents  to  describe  
legal forms, technical systems and business models. 
Data  trusts  have  been  conceptualised  as  being  constructed  using  trust  or  common  law,  but  only  one  
respondent specified that they had given thought to this (they had undertaken some research to understand 
how trust law could be applied in their context). Respondents described a wide range of legal approaches 
used to underpin their initiatives. Limited companies, foundations and nonprofits were the most frequent legal 
forms, with constructs such as cooperatives also mentioned. A number of respondents alluded to the fact 
that different legal forms were suitable in different circumstances. 
As well as the legal form of their initiative, respondents also commented on the wider legal conditions around 
them.  Respondents  cited  the  General  Data  Protection  Regulation  as  a  legislation  or  law  that  has  been  
‘specifically helpful or harmful to your initiative’. Other similar laws, such as the CDPR in California and the 
“Law for a digital republic in France” were also mentioned. 
                                                      
100 This project reached out to Worker Info Exchange to respond to this analysis, Worker Info Exchange agreed with our description of the initiative not currently meeting the GPAI definition, 
but described how the team was currently exploring whether becoming a data trust of this nature was a feasible undertaking. 

27 
 
The  technologies  adopted  by  the  respondents  were  also  varied.  Some  organisations  described  using  
blockchain, while the development of ‘pods’ or ‘vaults’ for personal data were also described. Blockchain was 
described  as  being  useful  by  initiatives  working  towards  creating  a  ‘trustless’  structure,  in  which  the  
distributed technology was seen as replacing the need for trustees to make decisions. The ‘pods’ and ‘vaults’ 
were  described  by  initiatives  seeking  to  help  users  to  have  more  control  over  data  about  them  on  an  
individual, rather than group, basis. There was also discussion of privacy enhancing technologies to ensure 
the safety of users' data, as well as Application Programming Interfaces to facilitate access to the data being 
brought together by the initiatives. 
Respondents also shared information about their business models. Most of the respondents described being 
funded by non-earned revenue streams, such as philanthropic funding, public funding or private investment. 
The predominance of unearned revenue reflects the relative infancy of bottom-up data stewardship initiatives 
and finding them early in their quest for sustainability
101
. A quarter of respondents described earned revenue 
streams, including membership fees for the users of the initiative, selling access to data to third parties and 
analysing and packaging the data into insights.  
I
n terms of the scale and maturity of the initiatives, 50% of the respondents had 1,000 members or less, and 
80% of the initiatives are less than 5 years old (or are yet to be operational).  
2.4. Attitudes towards data trusts 
The survey also sought to understand the respondents’ attitudes and perspectives on data trusts. 
A number of survey respondents, both experts and practitioners, were positive about the potential of data 
trusts. By increasing the control people have over data about them, a number of respondents thought that 
data trusts could help to rebalance the power asymmetry in the data economy. One respondent stated that 
through data trusts, people’s data could be better safeguarded from private interests, avoiding ‘abusive data 
relationships’.  Respondents  felt  data  trusts  could  also  work  towards  a  future  where  there  was  increased  
access to and usage of data for public benefit. They described how data trusts could be designed to tackle 
“problems in which individuals are interested in combining their data to get a broader analysis of a specific 
challenge, or where individuals benefit from pooling their data”. 
Some respondents described the lack of practical examples of data trusts holding the concept back. There 
was a strong desire, verging on impatience, among some of the experts to see an operational data trust, 
even to the point where some described that the concept had become ‘somewhat of a fantasy’. Others were 
concerned that the focus on an approach to bottom-up data stewardship that only exists as a concept may 
detract from other similar -  but importantly, operational -  approaches (such as those featured as case studies 
in this report). Some respondents were also concerned about the potential uptake of data trusts as and when 
they  became  functional,  feeling  that  the  demand  for  them  originates  largely  from  experts  and  reaching  a  
critical  mass  of  users  would  require  a  dramatic  shift  in  culture,  understanding  and  skills  across  the  data  
economy.

3. Case studies 
● This section consists of three case studies of bottom-up data stewardship initiatives: Driver’s 
Seat, Open Humans and MIDATA. 
● They represent real-world examples of how groups can be empowered around data they’ve 
generated, and are actively making available data for broad societal benefit. 
● They  have  been  selected  on  the  basis  of  their  community-centrism  and  maturity,  and  the  
studies unpack the purposes for their formation, their stakeholders served, their legal structure, 
their internal data governance principles and the technical safeguards used to mediate access 
to data. 
3.1. Criteria and selection 
This section of the report consists of three case studies of bottom-up data stewardship initiatives. They are 
intended to shed light on the practical considerations involved in designing such an initiative, and to surface 
perspectives from practitioners operating them. 
The  case  studies  rely  on  secondary  research  in  the  form  of  Aapti  and  the  ODI’s  internal  interview  notes,  
analysis and videos. The cases were selected using the two criteria: 
1. Maturity -   There are many interesting proposals and theoretical models for data  trusts and bottom-
up data stewardship initiatives. However, for the purposes of the case studies, we skewed towards 
those that are operational (i.e. actively supporting data to ‘flow’ between actors). 
2.   Community-centrism -    Empowering people to exercise meaningful control over data takes many 
forms. We have chosen cases that adopt a collective, participatory approach to data stewardship, 
such that their members dictate how their data is used, by whom and for what purposes. 
Ideally, Aapti and the ODI would have liked to feature initiatives that responded to the survey as case studies. 
However, the researchers found that Driver’s Seat,  Open Humans and MIDATA
 not just satisfy the above 
mentioned  criteria  more  so  than  respondents,  but  are  perhaps  some  of  the  most  promising  examples  of  
bottom-up data stewardship in general. 
As well as showing the variety of design choices available, the case studies, albeit anecdotal, highlight the 
virtues of bottom-up stewardship.

3.2 Driver’s Seat 
Overview 
Driver’s Seat enables workers in the gig economy to gain control over their data and access analytics that 
help them earn more from their labour. 
Founded in 2019 in Colorado, USA, the platform was developed over conversations with Uber and Lyft drivers 
whose work was mediated by the ‘extraction, processing and delivering of data’ via algorithms that tended to 
deny workers of their agency and a voice in negotiating their working conditions.
102
 Driver’s Seat also aids in 
the monetisation of driver’s mobility data by selling access to public authorities and local governments that 
use  these  insights  in  policy  making  and  resource  allocation.
103
  Consequently,  the  entity  unlocks  societal  
value by directing data use towards public benefit, while simultaneously compensating the members of its 
cooperative for their role in generating this data.

 Figure 5: Structure of Driver’s Seat (Source: Aapti/ODI analysis) 
 
Purpose 
The core stated purpose of Driver’s Seat is to enable participation of gig workers in the governance of their 
data and  derive  monetary/instrumental  value  that  could  potentially  reduce  the  precarity  associated  with  
platform-mediated  labour.  Additionally,  the  platform  presents  opportunities  for  monetisation  of  aggregated  
mobility data and its insights by selling it to public transportation agencies.
104
 This information provides crucial 
inputs for policy making in areas such as pollution control and congestion management. In fact, municipal 
authorities  are  afforded  visibility  into  rideshare  operational  patterns  and  analytics  that  are  otherwise  
challenging to access or comprehend.  
Structure 
Driver’s  Seat  is  registered  as  a  for-profit,  limited  cooperative  association  in  Colorado,  USA.  The  primary  
beneficiaries of this platform are rideshare and delivery workers who have signed up to become members of 
the cooperative. It adopts a delegated cooperative structure that is governed by a representative board, with 
at least 51% of the board members drawn from the larger community of workers.
105
 This structure is quite 
unlike  MIDATA,  considered  below,  which  instead  adopts  a  ‘one  member,  one  vote’,  approach  to  internal  
governance.  
R
ideshare  and  delivery  workers  who  are  a  part  of  Driver’s  Seat  share  data  with  the  application,  which  
functions as a data storage and analytics platform. Insights and visualisations created on the platform not 
only enhance the agency of gig workers by placing data in their control, but also provide crucial information 
that  enables  them  to  optimise  for  higher  wages  and  better  working  conditions.  Moreover,  Driver’s  Seat 
enables this data to be shared with local government transit operators, promising to improve the reach and 
effectiveness of citizen service delivery and experience.
106
 
Membership fee, grant money and private investments are the intended funding streams for Driver’s Seat. 
However, monetisation of insights and aggregated data sold to public authorities is currently its sole source 
of revenue.

Stakeholders 
The primary stakeholders served by Driver’s Seat are gig workers: rideshare and delivery drivers employed 
by Uber, Lyft, DoorDash, Uber Eats, Amazon Flex and Postmates operating within the US. These workers 
also constitute the data generators whose mobility information and personal data is managed by the platform. 
Data users include local government and transportation agencies that use analytics and aggregated mobility 
data supplied by Driver’s Seat as a part of urban policy and planning.
108
 
The representative board governing the cooperative is the designated decision-making body that authorises 
all data sharing and selling activities. 
Governance principles 
The  data  stewarded  by  Driver’s  Seat  includes  members’  personal  data  as  well  as  anonymised  mobility  
information. The data rights are vested in the cooperative board, with individual members retaining only the 
right to revoke consent for data use. 
Significantly, data sharing and selling decisions are authorised through the cooperative board in which gig 
workers  hold  at  least  51%  representation  and  voting  rights.  Further,  the  members  are  also  entitled  to  a  
minimum  51%  of  the  share  of  profits  generated  by  Driver’s  Seat.  The  twin  features  of  representation  and  
share in profits are mandated by the Colorado Uniform Limited Cooperative Association Act, 2012.
109
  
Members of the cooperative participate in data decisions by electing representatives to the board. Individual 
consent for data access, processing and sharing is obtained at the point of on-boarding to the Driver’s Seat 
application. Lastly, members can revoke consent for any of these functions and request deletion of their data 
via email.
110
 
Privacy controls 
Driver’s Seat anonymises the data contributed by drivers and shares only aggregated datasets and insights 
with  its  data  users  once  approved  by  the  board.
111
  Personalised  analytics  and  visualisation  derived  from  
individual members’ data is not shared with third parties. 
Analysis 
Monetisation of aggregated data and insights by Driver’s Seat performs two functions -  one, it contributes to 
the income of gig workers who are profit-participants in the entity and two, creates a viable source of revenue 
that contributes to the financial sustainability of Driver’s Seat. Delegated representation afforded through the 
entity’s  cooperative  board  upholds  participation  of  data  generators  in  decision-making  as  a  core  of  its 
operating principles.  
The experience of Driver’s Seat holds interesting insights for data trusts and data trust-like initiatives that 
hope to facilitate effective purpose-driven data sharing. Additionally, the social value element can be fulfilled 
by identifying appropriate stakeholders, in this case public transit agencies, who stand to benefit from the 
use  of  the  data  stewarded  by  the  initiative.  Delegated  representation  and  decision-making  through  the  
cooperative board could potentially reduce the burden on beneficiaries to evaluate granular considerations 
on data sharing, while simultaneously availing valuable advisory services from the board.

3.3. Open Humans 
Overview 
Open Humans is a not-for-profit that allows individuals and communities to donate personal data for use in 
research, education and health projects. 
Established  in  2015  in  the  US,  the  platform  helps  individuals  access  and  understand  their  personal  data  
through an Open Humans account and donate it for projects that align with their values or goals. The entity 
facilitates public benefit data sharing while providing granular and dynamic controls, creating opportunities 
for bottom-up decision-making and data governance. 
Open  Humans  differs  from  Driver’s  Seat  on  two  fronts:  Open  Humans  supports  granular  decision-making 
functions by allowing each member to approve or disapprove use of their data in a specific project, and the 
incentive to participate is altruistic as the entity does not stand to make any profits or generate revenue from 
its sharing activities. 
 
 
 Figure 6: Structure of Open Humans (Source: Open Humans website)  
Purpose  
Open Humans is designed to empower individuals and communities around their personal information, by 
combining technology and community governance of data to advance an open, participant-centric approach 
to human subjects research.
112
 It has built a platform for collaboration between communities and researchers, 
directing  data  to  projects  or  purposes  that  fulfill  the  data  donors'  personal  expectations.  The  entity  also  
facilitates citizen science and subject participation in health research. Open Humans currently has 12,364 
members.
113

[Video]. Youtube. https://youtu.be/L9GHP-u0gK4  
113 As on 20 September, 2021, reported on the organisation’s website.  

33 
 
Structure 
Open  Humans  is  registered  as  a  501(c)(3)  nonprofit  organization  in  the  US
114
.  In  addition  to  providing  a  
platform for collaboration and data sharing, Open Humans allows individuals to run analytics on their personal 
data and understand it through free and open source “notebooks” that can be embedded in one’s browser. 
115
  The  entity  is  funded  through  grants  from  Robert  Wood  Johnson  Foundation,  Knight  Foundation  and  
Shuttleworth Foundation.
116
  
Stakeholders 
Individuals who have signed up as members of the Open Humans community are the data producers, while 
academic  institutions,  citizen  scientists  and  researchers  comprise  the  data  requestors  and  users.  Data  
sharing decisions are made by individuals who can agree to sharing their personal data, particularly health 
data, for a specific project. Therefore, consent is specific to a project and can be revoked at any point.
117
 
Governance principles 
The members of Open Humans are the primary decision-makers. They retain full control over their personal 
data  and  authorise  its  use  through  granular  controls  on  a  project-to -project  basis.
118
  Individuals  and  
communities willing to donate their data for research are encouraged to examine the purpose and value of a 
particular project before agreeing to share their data.  
S
imilarly,  any  member  of  Open  Humans  - irrespective  of  their  academic  background  -   can  create  
projects/research studies about a specific theme. This is best demonstrated through the many citizen science 
projects hosted on the platform.
119
 All projects undergo a community review process, performing a role akin 
to the ethics or internal review board within academia. The review is an open and public process in which 
every member can participate. Communities can de-platform a project as a part of the review process.
120
  
Privacy controls 
Data may or may not be anonymised or pseudonymised before it is shared; it is dependent on the nature of 
research involved.
121
 Member data is centrally stored on the Open Humans platform and a copy in shareable 
formats is made available to third parties who have been authorized to access the data.
122
 Analytics, insights 
and visualisation accessed by individuals through personalised “notebooks” and such tools hosted on the 
platform are not shared with third parties, unless otherwise consented to by an individual.  
Analysis  
Open  Humans  presents  a  unique  use  case  of  a  bottom-up  data  steward  that  is  explicitly  concerned  with  
facilitating data sharing for social benefit. Individuals and communities are invited to become a part of the 
entity and participate actively in research projects that appeal to them personally, exploring themes that are 
otherwise  often  marginalised within  conventional  academic  discourse.  For  instance,  a  project  on  the  
dynamics and perceptions of the neovagina is currently being hosted on the Open Humans platform. It allows 
members to deliberate on the research methodology and frame questions that should be addressed as a 
part  of  this  study.  In  essence,  the  platform  embeds  health  research  within  a  strong  framework  of  citizen-
driven science and community interests.

3.4. MIDATA 
Overview 
MIDATA is a member-owned cooperative that provides an open source technical platform for account holders 
to store their personal data and share it with researchers and service providers. 
Developed by ETH Zurich and Bern University of Applied Sciences, MIDATA Switzerland was established in 
2015  and  the  entity  supports  the creation  of  other  regional  or  national  cooperatives  that  use  MIDATA’s  
technical infrastructure.
123
 MIDATA account holders can control who has access to their data and direct its 
use in specific clinical studies. 
 
 
Figure 7: Structure of MIDATA (Source: MidData website) 
 
Purpose 
The  cooperative  was  established  to  fulfill  two  objectives:  to  enable  citizens  to  gain  control  over  health  
information and to amass valuable aggregated health data for use in medical research.
124
 MIDATA allows 
individuals to engage with health research projects and determine if they wish to contribute their data to a 
certain study. Thus, it facilitates active participation of data subjects in medical research.
125
 
Structure 
MIDATA  is  a  non-profit  cooperative,  registered  under  Article  828  of  the  Swiss  Code  of  Obligations.
126
  It’s 
primary   function   includes   the   development,   deployment   and   maintenance   of   a   common   technical   
infrastructure  that  allows  MIDATA  data  account  holders  and  members  to  store  their  personal  data.  
                                                      
123 Ibid.  
124 Ibid. 
125 MIDATA (2021). Retrieved from https://www.MIDATA.coop/en/partners/  
126 Corporate law of Switzerland is primarily contained within the Swiss Code of Obligations, from Article 552 to 1186. Cooperatives such as MIDATA are governed as 
per provisions under Article 828 to 926.  

35 
 
Significantly, members of the cooperative govern the use of data through a system of rights vested within 
Article 4 of MIDATA’s Articles of Association.
127
 
Members  of  the  cooperative  are  required  to  pay  a  one-time  fee  of  CHF  40  to  cover  administration  and  
operational  costs  incurred  for  managing  the  cooperative.
128
  Private  investments,  including  grant  money,  
seem to constitute its primary source of funding.  
Stakeholders 
Individuals who hold an account on the MIDATA platform and members of the MIDATA cooperative are the 
primary data producers in this context. The nature of data stored and managed through the MIDATA platform 
is primarily personal data, including sensitive health information such as genomic data and medical records. 
They consent to share their data on a per-project basis with pharmaceutical companies, research institutions 
and other interested third parties that make up the category of data requestors.
129
  
Governance principles 
Data  sharing  decisions  undergo  two  levels  of  review  and  authorisation.  First,  every  proposal  containing  a  
request for data is reviewed by MIDATA’s Data Ethics Review Board.
130
 The board may choose to admit a 
proposal, depending on the nature and purpose of research involved. Creating value for MIDATA’s members 
and  data  account  holders  whilst  contributing  to  society’s  knowledge  on  a  particular  health  condition  is  a  
crucial consideration in the process of review. Second, the proposal that has been vetted by the Board is 
then sent to the general assembly of members for further authorisation. The general assembly follows a ‘one 
member, one vote’ model typical of cooperatives and a simple majority vote is necessary to gain approval 
for a proposed project.
131
 
 
 
Figure 8: Governance mechanism of MIDATA (Source: MIDATA website) 
Individual members and data account holders on the platform may consent to independently and exclusively 
share their personal data (or a specific subset therein) with other account holders, the cooperative itself or 
third parties requesting data.
132
 Consent collection is digitally-mediated and obtained through the MIDATA

platform. Data producers (i.e. individuals) reserve the right to revoke consent for data use through the process 
of research and beyond.
133
 
Privacy controls  
All data on the MIDATA platform is stored centrally on servers in Switzerland and follow multi-level encryption 
and ‘a perfect forward secrecy protocol’.
134
 Individual data may or may not be anonymised or pseudonymised 
prior to sharing, varying on the proposal under consideration and the nature of data required to undertake 
research. Third party data requestors are granted access to granular datasets of individuals who consent to 
sharing data for a specific project, after obtaining necessary authorisation for the project from the Data Ethics 
Review Board and the general assembly. 
135
 
Analysis  
MIDATA is founded on traditional cooperative principles that have been transposed onto the current data-
driven world. It creates an environment for cooperative members to pool their data and use it in pursuit of 
their  collective  desires.  Sophisticated  standards  for  health  data  interoperability  followed  by  MIDATA  
combined with a direct democracy approach to data sharing help achieve transparency and utomost technical 
safeguards  for  responsible  bottom-up stewardship.  Authorisation  layers  in  the  nature  of  MIDATA’s  Data  
Ethics  Review  Board  help  ensure  compliance  with  community  interests  and  that  the  members  of  the  
cooperative are involved at every step of the data value chain. Lastly, the not-for-profit nature of MIDATA 
avoids  any  conflict  of  interests  that  may  arise  when  financial  imperatives  are  posed  against  public  good  
solutions.
136
 
3.5 Insights from case studies 
The  experiences  of  Driver’s  Seat,  Open  Humans  and  MIDATA  chronicled  in  this  section  surface  valuable 
reference points on the subject of data trusts and data trust-like initiatives. Although there exists significant 
differences in their structure -  MIDATA and Driver’s Seat are data cooperatives while Open Humans is a non-
profit -   the  three  use-cases nonetheless  deliberately  focalise  community  empowerment  as  the  underlying  
purpose of their initiatives. 
By  examining  real-world  case  studies,  the  research  demonstrates  the  multiplicity  of  avenues  and  design  
choices  that  are  available  to  builders  of  data  trusts  and  data  trust-like  initiatives  to  actualise  bottom-up 
mechanisms  for  stewardship.  Further,  it  illustrates  how  initiatives  managing  the  use  of  data  can  embed  
participation  of  data  generators  as  a  cornerstone  of  their  governance  principles.  This  marks  a  crucial  
departure  from  the  current  disempowering  paradigm  of  data  sharing  that  is  opaque,
137
  extractive
138
  and 
marginalises the role of individuals and communities in data decisions.
139
  
T
hese case studies highlight the virtues of bottom-up stewardship. Data sharing decisions within the use-
cases considered go hand-in -hand with respect for agential rights of individuals and creation of social benefit 
through the use of data. Responsible data stewardship makes available data for social benefit in ways that 
are  democratic  and  privacy-preserving,  while  balancing  complex  considerations  of  market  incentives  and  
public  welfare.
140
  Thus,  upcoming  data  trusts  and  data  trust-like  initiatives  should  embody  participatory

mechanisms for stewardship that can engineer effective outcomes for all stakeholders -  communities, private 
entities and the public at large.  
4. Key findings and takeaways 
The research generated the following key findings and takeaways on the global state of data trusts: 
1.   While there is emerging consensus around what functions a data trust should deliver, there remain 
questions about the specific operational strategies which can deliver these functions in practice.
141
 
However, the research encountered a plurality of bottom-up data stewardship initiatives that enable 
groups to engage in data sharing for social benefit and embody features that are nonetheless similar 
and attributed to data trusts. 
2. The
re is general optimism about the potential of data trusts among people working on data 
stewardship. Both practitioner and expert respondents to the survey described a positive outlook 
on data trusts as an approach to data stewardship. Indeed, many were eager -  and in some cases 
impatient -  to see  real-world examples to begin to test the considerable theory behind them. 
3. The interest in data trusts as a form of data stewardship seems to be driven from Europe and 
North America. The response to the survey -  with 37 of the 45 respondents based in Europe and 
North America -  suggests a relative maturity in terms of imagining new forms of data stewardship. 
This may be due to the existence of data protection regulations that afford data rights, such as the 
right to access and potability, which are prerequisites to actualise bottom-up initiatives (such as the 
ones featured here as case studies).This means the maturity of the data rights landscape needs to 
be borne in mind while recommended data trusts in different jurisdictions.  
4. The purpose for bottom-up data stewardship can differ significantly. The examples examined 
in  this  research  are  markedly  different  in  their  purpose,  and  subsequently  their  legal  forms,  
governance  processes  and  business  model.  Initiatives  such  as  MIDATA  and  Open  Humans  are  
driven by altruistic motivations for data sharing. On the other hand, initiatives such as Driver’s Seat, 
Swash  and  Digi.me  seek  to  financially  compensate  those  that  have  contributed  data  by  charging  
interested parties for access. 
5. There  are  a  number  of  real-world  initiatives  that  demonstrate  multiple  routes  to  realising  
bottom-up data stewardship. The survey findings and case studies exhibit a diversity of initiatives 
united in their efforts to empower individuals and communities to steward data. This highlights that 
there is no ‘one-size-fits-all’ framework for operationalising participatory forms of data stewardship.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
This report forms one of two interlinked outputs supported by the Global Partnership for Artificial Intelligence 
(GPAI), centered around data trusts. This work takes a focussed look at the existing and necessary global 
legal landscape needed to enable data trusts. It aims to canvas global jurisdictions to assess their legislative 
data  regimes,  and  provide  a  framework  by  which  to  evaluate  the  feasibility  of  data  trusts  in  selected  
jurisdictions.  In  the  conversation  to  enable  data  sharing  and  governance  mechanisms  that  feed  societal  
value, data trusts have been a focal point, particularly due to the degree of accountability that fiduciary duties 
in common law trusts can enable. To implement data trusts, however, numerous aspects require untangling 
-  one of these is the legal applicability of trust law to the context of data, and related ecosystem-level needs, 
the focus of this report.  
Beginning with a literature review that encompasses the bases and evolution of data trusts as a structure for 
human-centric  data  governance,  this  report  posits  the  legal  challenges  foreseen  in  transmuting  trusts  for  
data. In order to carry out a global legal review, we developed a framework for necessary legal enablers as 
well as gating criteria for the jurisdictions considered in the analysis. This process and the challenges within 
it have been documented in this report. While the aim has been to encompass common law, civil code, and 
mixed legal systems - marrying them in a composite analysis framework is complex, as trust law and fiduciary 
duties feature most firmly and fundamentally in common law. Beyond the contours of fiduciary obligations, 
data rights, protection and sharing frameworks were also foregrounded as key enablers for data trusts -  and 
each region has been evaluated upon these. Consequently, all eleven jurisdictions have been measured for 
their ‘preparedness’ to enable data trusts, and analysis for each has been detailed as well. While it is helpful 
to  understand  the  data  trust  fertility  across  these  regions,  it  has  been  a  delicate  balance  to  provide  
assessment  while  allowing  for  subjective  interpretations  of  these  legal  landscapes,  and  the  myriad  
(sociological, political and economic) nuances embedded in each region. Given this, the framework deploys 
a  scale  that  moves  from  ‘poorly  defined’  to  ‘robust’.  It  must  be  noted,  however,  that  each  of  these  data  
regimes are dynamic and evolving -  implicitly, the analysis holds potential to be built upon and populated 
further. In many cases, our analysis has featured not only enacted legislation, but policy directives and other 
indicators of potential legal approaches to data governance.  
This  legal  review  has  brought  forth  numerous  insights  - on  parity  across  jurisdictions,  the  need  for  robust  
digital infrastructure, and the potential to embed different models of data stewardship, optimised for different 
contexts. Beyond the scope of legal analysis, challenges in implementing data trusts still remain. Building 
trust, establishing sustainable and beneficiary-oriented incentive structures, solving for notions of community 
data rights, and embedding meaningfully participatory governance in data trusts are a few of the questions 
that have followed from this research. It is hoped that the ecosystem of academics, policymakers, builders 
and  civil  society  actors  will  build  upon  these  questions  and  analyses,  as  data  regimes  and  pathways  to  
societal value crystallise in the coming years.

INTRODUCTION 
The  role  of  data  in  solving  for  some  of  the  world's  most  pressing  societal  challenges  -  whether  through  
healthcare, climate, mobility or scientific research -  has become increasingly clear. Innovation is increasingly 
predicated in data-driven processes, and the success and conception of most artificial intelligence is defined 
too by data access and usability. In the shadow of this potential value, however, is a status quo reflecting 
stark  inequities  within  the  data  economy  - power  is  skewed  toward  large  corporations  and  governments,  
while  individuals  and  communities  retain  little  visibility  or  agency  into  their  datas  journey,  usage  or  
governance.  
As countries move to govern their data, regulation has shown a pronounced focus on the individual -  on data 
protection,  building  robust  consent  frameworks  and  in  some  cases,  instituting  mature  data  rights  like  
accessibility  or  portability.  As  this  process  unfolds  across  the  globe,  it  is  time  to  begin  unpacking  another  
important goal -  empowering communities and enabling collectivisation to accrue the latent societal value of 
data. In recent years, scholars and practitioners have explored data trusts as a form of stewardship -  one 
which envisions accountable and rights preserving pathways to both agency, and innovation-oriented value. 
While data stewardship has seen numerous instantiations, it has equally faced challenges of implementation. 
There  is  a  need  here,  to  examine  how  legislation  may  best  enable  community  governance,  and  human-
centric modes to manage our data.  
In particular, data trusts are conceptualised upon existing common law pillars of trust law, and accountability 
instilled  through  fiduciary  obligations.  While  this  may  present  a  compelling  framework  for  delegated  
negotiation, collectivised leverage and responsible, streamlined data sharing -  there are numerous lacunas 
in relying on trust law for data. It is in this context that we undertake an exercise in legal landscaping. The 
aim of this research, while nascent and largely unaccompanied by any sibling literature, is to provide a useful 
starting  point  and  evaluation  to  understand  the  legal  mechanisms  that  can  enable  data  trust  initiatives.  
Further, we analyse various global jurisdictions for their preparedness across these mechanisms -  working 
through common and civil law systems, Global North and South countries, and countries at various stages 
in  their  data  policy  journeys.  The  breadth  of  this  exercise  has  landed  us  at  various  permutations  and  
combinations of preparedness, historical, legal and technical contexts across these regions. Thus, it is hoped 
that  this  analysis  will  serve  as  early  literature  to  a  growing  body  of  work  - how  can  data  policy  effectively  
enable trusted intermediaries and social benefit?  
The following study adopts a function-first approach -  using the actionable features assumed of a data trust 
to arrive at their corresponding legal pathways. At the outset, we establish the need for data stewardship, 
confine  the  term  ‘data  trusts’  to  a  single  definition,  and  assess  the  foreseeable  legal  hiccups  in  
implementation of the same. The weight of this work has been in its processes and comparative analysis - 
building a working framework for legal analysis by treading from roles of a trust, to functions, and arriving at 
necessary  legal  enablers.  Beyond  this,  the  selection  of  jurisdictions  for  analysis,  and  the  application  of  a  
uniform framework to the vast global variety threw up a number of challenges -  all of which we have attempted 
to chronicle in this report. While the analysis itself has yielded valuable insights, it is the authors’ intention for 
this work to be built upon and multiplied -  as the approaches and upshots of global data regimes steadily 
make themselves known.

SECTION 1 
 
The report's introductory section traces data trust's theoretical and legal underpinnings, especially 
its reliance on common law trust frameworks. This has been carried out by a literature review, 
drawing on the works of various academics, practitioners, and organisations. The introduction is 
prefaced by discussions on the existing power imbalances in the data economy and the need to 
develop human-centric approaches to data governance.  
Finally,  building  on  these  discussions,  the  final  part  of  the  section  lays  the  foundations  for  the  
methodology  and  framework  by  outlining  the  various  challenges  that  are  foreseen  in  the  
implementation  of  data  trusts.  The  key  insights  from  the  discussions  in  this  section  were  as  
follows: 
● Given  the  marked  imbalances  in  the  data  economy,  there  is  a  growing  realisation  for  the  
need to recognise data stewards that can preserve and advance the rights and interests of 
individuals. 
● While there are different models of stewardship that can mediate these relationships, relying 
on trust law frameworks, data trusts represent a model of stewardship that places fiduciary 
responsibility at its heart. 
● However, fitting data trusts in existing structures give rise to multiple challenges across legal 
systems that need to be explored.  
1.1 The need for human centric approaches to data governance 
In recent years, the rapid advancement of data-driven innovations and the computational tools that facilitate 
them  has  led  to  the  development  of  a  vast  data  economy.
142
  At  the  core  of  which  lies  the  individual  data  
subject; generating both personal data and non-personal community data.
143
 However, the status quo of this 
economy  reflects  a  fundamental  power  imbalance  in  the  kinds  of  value  being  derived  from  such  data  
drivenness. Value has been directed largely by market-first, profit oriented motives from private corporations, 
limiting not only the actualisation of data’s societal value, but access to data itself. Consequently, individuals 
and communities are disadvantaged, unable to wield meaningful control over or partake in the governance, 
management  and  usage  of  their  data.  This  asymmetry  is  both  compounded  by  and  symptomatic  of  the  
atomisation  present  in  the  data  economy  today  - a  fragmentation  that  creates  no  digital  conception  of  
communities.  Data  is  relational,  and  shared  lived  experiences  are  often  used  in  tandem  to  facilitate  the  
weaponization of data. Further, it is now omnipresent in increasingly consequential decisions about users, 
workers, citizens, environmental and other resources, and the broader public. In many ways, data presents 
the new tool of exploitation.
144
 
T
here  has  been a  steady  global  policy  shift  toward  more  privacy-oriented  and  rights  preserving  data  
governance -  one that hopes to rebalance power toward the individual. With the EU’s GDPR acting often as 
a median for other nations to build robust data protection, mature data rights like accessibility and portability 
are slowly finding voice. This has been simultaneous (though not necessarily equivalent) with the advent of 
community-oriented  data  intermediaries  - data  stewards.
145
  A  data  steward  can  be  defined  as  a  trusted 
intermediary acting on behalf of data subjects or data generators, in their relationship with data requestors.

As a body that acts in the interest of data subjects, stewards work to enable greater agency, transparency 
and protection for subjects, negotiate with data requesters, and seek avenues for societal benefit from data. 
Thus,  the  role  of  a  steward  is  dual:  both  rights  preserving  and  value  generative.  Stepping  beyond  the  
paradigm of individual protection, stewardship strives to empower and circularise value chains
146
 -   not only 
for those who most crucially drive the data economy, but to use data as a leveller for pre-digital vulnerabilities 
in society. However, data is difficult to govern -  its value is defined most critically by how it is used, this value 
is  often  dynamic  over  time,  and  different  data  types  necessitate  different  rights,  needs  and  management.  
Given these challenges, data stewardship embodies a diverse set of structures, most of which are problem-
led, and seek to responsibly solve for sectoral or purpose driven goals. Many of these are currently being 
implemented in practice, and they are being robustly analysed as they evolve.
147
 Section 1.2 introduces the 
concept of trusts as a potential legal framework for data. 
1.2 Data trusts as a legal framework that can be transmuted for data  
Some  models  for  data  stewardship  draw  from  existing  legal  frameworks  to  implement  various  modes  of  
community  governance  over  different  data  types.  For  example,  an  increasingly  prevalent  stewardship  
structure, data cooperatives map to the traditional cooperative model. Members typically partake in decision 
making in a democratic one-member-one-vote structure, pool their resources (in this case data) and work to 
further a common societal or other goal. The Driver’s Seat
148
 cooperative provides platform workers on ride 
sharing platforms with useful analytics on their data, enabling greater transparency and agency over their 
daily wages -  which are typically informed by this data but not shared with drivers. Once aggregated, these 
insights are also sold to local governance and transport agencies, the revenue from which is divided amongst 
the cooperative members.  
D
ata trusts present another model that relies on an existing legal framework -  based most foundationally in 
the concept of fiduciary responsibility. This will be elucidated further in this study. While common law trusts 
most broadly denote a transference or delegation of rights, ownership or some kind of property to a fiduciary 
(trustee), the structure for data trusts has differed across many thinkers and this discourse remains dynamic. 
For the purpose of this research, data trusts are defined as ‘A form of data stewardship that supports data 
producers to pool their data (or data rights) to collectively negotiate terms of use with potential data users, 
through  the  oversight  by  independent  trustees,  with  fiduciary  duties,  and  within  a  framework  of  technical,  
legal and policy interventions that facilitate data use and provide strong safeguards against misuse.’ 
149
  
There are other approaches to data stewardship, such as Data Commons, which are not embedded in law 
but only in practice. However, the focus on legal perspectives, and particularly on data trusts, is informed by 
the high levels of accountability that law can provide. In this context, we explore the conception of data trusts 
and how it has evolved -  beginning at the notion of information fiduciaries, and the possibility of heightened 
accountability for data controllers.  
A fiducial view of data governance 
Scholars  like  Balkin
150
  and  Tuch
151
  identify  an  increasing  dependency  and  vulnerability  toward  big  
technologies as functionally similar to traditional fiduciary relationships that individuals have with doctors and 
lawyers. Fiduciary relationships typically involve some exercise of discretionary power over the interests of 
the recipient/beneficiary. This power is authorised through consent, unilateral undertaking or legal decree.
152
 
To  address  this  imbalance  between  individuals  and  technology  corporations,  they  rely  on  conventional 
fiduciary  principles  to  propose  recognising  big  technological  corporations  that  depend  on  data-driven

algorithmic processing as ‘information fiduciaries’.
153
 Depending on the nature of their relationship with users, 
these  information  fiduciaries,  Balkin  argues,  ought  to  be  bound  by  fiduciary  duties  to  impose  a  higher  
standard of care -  one that ensures the prevention of harm towards consumers.
154
  
Balkin's   classification   of   information   fiduciaries   gathered   support   from   academics,   lawmakers,   and   
technology companies. However, attempts to embed these ideas of trust and fiduciary duty in regulating data 
rights
155
, have failed to define obligations that address these imbalances. For instance, the Indian Personal 
Data  Protection  Bill’s  conception  of  a  data  fiduciary -   which  is  the  GDPR  equivalent  of  a  data  controller  -  
except when dealing with children’s data, does not require data fiduciaries to make decisions that prioritize 
the data subjects' interests.  
H
owever, scholars like Khan, Pozen, and Grimmelman - while in agreement with the underlying recognition 
of  the  asymmetry  of  information  and  control  - are  critical  of  this  approach.  Khan  and  Pozen  contend  that  
imposing  a  higher  standard  of  care  on  corporations  -   owing  to  their  divided  loyalties  to  shareholders  and  
consumers -   is antithetical to fiduciary law.
156
   Grimmelmann further adds to this shortcoming by noting that 
defining the contours of loyalty for information fiduciaries has its limitations; it either risks being too rigid or 
too broad.
157
  
Addressing the concerns posed by Khan et al., Delacroix and Lawrence, rely on the common law conception 
of trusts -envisaging data trusts as a form of bottom-up data governance wherein data subjects pool their 
data rights for a common purpose.
158
 Part of the reason why legal trusts have captured current discourse 
around  data  stewardship,  when  thinking  about  accountability,  is  because  of  the  fiduciary  obligations  that  
trustees have towards their beneficiaries.  While the exact nature of fiduciary duties vary across jurisdictions, 
at the heart of it, fiduciaries must act with utmost loyalty towards the beneficiaries. The common law notion 
of trust involves the administration of privately owned assets by independent trustees who act on behalf of 
the beneficiaries identified by the asset owner.
159
  
Data trusts propose the appointment of independent trustees -  which owe a fiduciary duty to these subjects 
-   to  make  impartial  decisions  on  the  collectivized  pool  of  rights.  Fiduciary  duty  entails  a  high  level  of  
accountability, particularly because there is a disparity in power between trustees and beneficiaries. In most 
cases, this also means that courts are enabled to intervene in the functioning and structure of a trust at a 
normative level, allowing greater oversight to the benefit of subjects. The trustee, therefore, cannot use the 
asset  for  their  own  personal  gain.  These  structures  seek  to  enhance  individual  control  over  personal  
information.
160
  
While the conception of data trusts draws from principles of equity and trusts, the use of data trusts so far 
has been theoretical, and the legal and regulatory frameworks on which data trusts may stand on are yet to 
be defined. Any policy intervention, therefore, requires a granular identification of the mechanisms that can 
instantiate data trusts. At the outset of such an exercise, it is important to first identify the existing gaps and 
challenges in implementing the features of trust law within the context of data.

1.3  Challenges foreseen in implementation of data trusts  
In  order  to  assess  the  possible  implementation  of  data  trusts,  we  have  examined  and  distilled  the  key  
challenges  that  are  likely  to  arise,  which  this  section  details.  From  a  legal  perspective,  these  range  from  
conceptions of fiduciary duty and means for accountability to the subject matter and assignment of data rights 
to  trustees.  Beyond  these,  there  remain  other  challenges  to  implementation  around  sustainability  and  
incentive structures. While these are pertinent questions, they do not feature in this review, which is limited 
to foundational legal tools that may facilitate data trusts.  
a)   Fiduciary duties  
Central to the idea of bottom-up data trusts is the management of the rights of the data holders in the interests 
of data providers. Trustees are, therefore, bound by a fiduciary responsibility that is underpinned by undivided 
loyalty  towards  their  beneficiaries.
161
  Undivided  loyalty  requires  the  fiduciary  to  place  the  beneficiary’s  
interests over their own and not have any interests that come in conflict with this.
162
 It is important to note 
that the identification of fiduciary relationships is context specific and jurisdiction specific.
163
 The nature of 
fiduciary responsibility may also vary according to the relationship; the fiduciary duty owed by a lawyer to a 
client  may  vary  from  the  one  owed  by  a  trustee  to  its  beneficiary.  And,  across  common  law  jurisdictions,  
fiduciary duty has a higher expectation of good faith than the common law conception of ‘reasonable care’.
164
 
G
iven the historical distinction in common law between courts of law and courts of equity, fiduciary principles 
developed distinctly as a product of equity. Civil law systems do not make this distinction.  Any exploration 
of the legal frameworks for data trust, needs to be wary of the limitations in relying solely on the common law 
conception  of  trusts.  Notwithstanding  a  few  civil  jurisdictions  that  have  either  ratified  the  Hague  Trust  
Convention
165
 or codified trusts within their legal systems, most civil law jurisdictions do not recognise legal 
trusts.   Envisaging   data   trusts   in   these   settings   will   require   careful   consideration   of   the   fiduciary   
responsibilities that data trusts seek to represent and identify functional equivalents of fiduciary-like principles 
of trustee-beneficiary relationships across these different legal systems. 
b) A
ccountability Mechanisms  
The recognition of a fiduciary relationship under trust law also ensures accountability mechanisms within the 
design of these trusts. A fiduciary relationship is essentially “one in which one party (the fiduciary) exercises 
discretionary power over the significant practical interests of another (the beneficiary)”.
166
 Within legal trusts, 
beneficiaries  hold  trustees  to  account  by  bringing  claims  against  trustees  if  they  feel  treated  unfairly  or  
dishonestly.
167
  
Similarly,accountability mechanisms can also be located in corporate structures through company's annual 
general meetings and provisions that allow the removal of directors. However, in most instances, directors 
owe fiduciary duties towards the company and not the shareholders. 
Furthermore, in legal trusts, the court's equitable jurisdiction gives it broader powers to redress harms arising 
in  fiduciary  relationships.However,  it  needs  to  be  explored  how  such  functional  frameworks  can  be  
transposed to or identified in jurisdictions that do not have such legal structures.  
c)   Identifying the subject matter of the trust 
Even  within  the  current  discourse  on  building  data  trusts  in  common  law  systems,  there  are  differing  
viewpoints on the reliance of legal trust structures to instantiate data trusts. The ODI’s report on legal and 
governance considerations contends that subject-matter requirements for legal trusts impede the conception 
of  data  trusts  within  the  existing  legal  framework.  The  report  asserts  that  data  is  not  capable  of  being

constituted as property “in the legal trust sense” and, therefore, ‘cannot form the basis of a legal trust’.
168
 
However, Delacroix and Lawrence, and Lau, Penner, and Wong, in their responses point out that even if this 
assertion of data not being property is made owing to its intangible nature, it does not hold ground as common 
law jurisdictions recognise intangible trade assets and bank accounts (the right to payment against a bank) 
as a subject matter of trusts.
169
 
McFarlane  makes  a  larger  point  on  how  it  is  inconsequential  as  to  whether  data  is  property  or  not.
170
 
‘Property’  in  the  legal  sense  reflects  different  ideas  in  different  contexts,  and  when  imagining  legal  
frameworks for data trusts, rather than examining whether a thing is data or not it is important to unbundle 
the scope rights over different data. McFarlane illustrates this through a scenario where B is owed a certain 
amount of money from A arising out of a contract between the two. In this context, the contractual right in 
itself is not a property. However, the rights to receive the money owed are perfectly capable of being held in 
trust. Unlike rights that define individuals by virtue of their identity as a right holder -  for instance a professional 
license  or  a  qualification  - data  rights  are  not  intrinsically  linked  to  a  particular  individual  in  the  same  
manner.
171
  
Therefore, under English law, the question of what can be held in data trusts depends on the type of data 
and  the  range  of  positive  rights  available  over  it.  This  also  raises  questions  on  how  these  pooled  rights  
interact with each other, and the extent to which they can be disaggregated.  It is important to note that even 
in jurisdictions that recognise trusts, the conception of what can be held as the subject-matter of trusts varies. 
d) Delineating the duties and interests of trustees and beneficiaries of the trust 
There  are  also  challenges  to  how  one  defines  beneficiaries  (and  their  interests)  and  trustees  (and  their  
obligations).  The  scope  of  definitions  of  who  or  what  group  constitutes  a  beneficiary  has  implications  on  
fiduciary actions.
172
 The ODI report asserts that sharing data for public benefit could be a breach of fiduciary 
duty as trusts in English law requires “the trustees to allow data to be shared only for the benefit of a defined 
group  of  beneficiaries”.  The  only  exception,  the  report  notes,  are  charitable  trusts,  which  can  operate  for  
public benefit. However, the report falls short of exploring them as it would only be “suitable for a minority of 
data  trusts”.
173
  However,  it  is  worth  noting  that  charitable  trusts  in  commonwealth  jurisdictions  such  as  
England, India and Australia are exempt from the beneficiary principle, i.e., they do not need to have identified 
beneficiaries, and can operate for the general benefit of the public in furtherance of an (abstract) purpose. 
T
he ODI Report also observes that trustees’ obligations not to use the property of the legal trust in a manner 
that  benefits  themselves  can  create  hurdles  for  beneficiaries  (data  providers)  to  be  trustees.  This  is  not  
entirely accurate as trustees –   under common law -  can also be beneficiaries of a trust if they are not the 
sole  beneficiary.
174
  Trustees,  in  fact,  can  be  remunerated  for  their  services  insofar  as  they  are  not  
unauthorised or secret profits obtained because of their position.

e)   Assigning data rights to third parties  
In  most  jurisdictions,  individual  rights  relating  to  data  are  sourced  from  data  protection  laws  and  the  
recognition  of  fundamental  rights  within  the  constitution.
175
  Data  protection  laws  such  as  the  GDPR,  the  
LGPD,  and  the  CCPA  recognise  certain  positive  rights  around  access,  use,  erasure,  and  data  portability.  
Whether current data protection laws allow the assignment of these rights to a third-party (the data trust) is 
an area which remains to be explored.  
C
oncurrently, personal data protection laws will also have a bearing on data trusts that fall within a specific 
jurisdiction. The plurality of bottom-up data trusts and the flexibility in the governance structures of these data 
trusts mean that the obligation and compliance requirements of a data trust will be dictated by the objects of 
the  specific  data  trust  and  the  definitions  used  under  the  relevant  personal  data  protection  laws
176
.  The  
GDPR, LGPD, and PDPB for instance, make a distinction between a data controller
177
 who determines the 
purpose and means of processing; and a data processor who merely “processes personal data on behalf of 
the controller". Data controllers have broader and more onerous responsibilities than data processors. The 
Canadian PIPEDA, on the other hand, does not make this distinction. 
T
he  interplay  of  various  rights  within  bottom-up  data  trusts  could  also  pose  new  questions  on  the  current  
framing  of  data  rights.  Collectivised  management  of  data  rights  under  the  trust  framework  would  require  
balancing conflicting rights and even the recognition of new data rights altogether. The idea of community 
rights  to  data  advanced  by  India’s  Ministry  of  Electronics  and  Information  Technology’s  (MeitY)  report  on  
Non-Personal  Data  (NPD)  is  a  case  in  point.
178
  The  NPD  framework  proposes  collective  rights  to  privacy  
over  community  non-personal  data  - in  contrast  to  the  framing  of  rights  over  personal  data  where  the  
individual is the focal point of data protection. 
A
t the most basic level, for data trusts that make decisions on the purposes and means of processing data, 
it  remains  to  be  seen  how  they  will  be  affected  by  the  notice  and  consent  requirements  specified  under  
various data protection laws. This is particularly relevant for data trustees and third parties when processing 
personal  data  of  individuals  and  communities.  Similarly,  the  principle  of  purpose  limitation  may  pose  
challenges for trustees to share data meaningfully. 
Having identified the challenges, it is evident that the instantiation of data trusts merit analysis that addresses 
questions  on  the  representation  of  data  rights  by  intermediaries  bound  by  fiduciary  responsibility.  
Consequently, it is essential to explore the legal landscape of data rights and legislative frameworks across 
different jurisdictions to identify opportunities and gaps in the development of data trusts. Section 2 sets forth 
the methodology and approach, detailing the considerations that went into framing our analysis. 
Can data rights form the subject matter of trusts across jurisdictions? 
Identifying what can constitute the subject matter of a trust is essential to the creation of data trusts. 
However, the evolution and reliance on the trust framework within jurisdictions that have adopted the 
common law system has not been uniform. Many of these countries have codified provisions in ways 
that may have departed in some ways from the core principles of English law trusts.  For instance, 
unlike  England,  India  and  South  Africa  do  not  recognise  the  concept  of  dual  ownership  for  trusts.  
Similarly,  while  courts  in  England  have  recognised  the  ability  for  trusts  to  hold  non-assignable 
contractual rights in trusts, it is not certain if this would apply to other jurisdictions that have legal trusts.  
For  instance,  section  8  of  the  Indian  Trusts  Act,  defines  subject  matter  of  trusts  as  “property  
transferable to the beneficiary”. Whether trusts can hold data (or the rights over it) is a question that 
needs to be examined in greater detail in each of these jurisdictions.   
                                                      
175  For eg: South Africa and India recognise the right to privacy within their constitutions.

SECTION 2 
 
Having  reviewed  the  challenges  in  representing  data  trusts  in  the  previous  section,  the 
following section presents the methodology and the resultant framework for the comparative 
analysis. The methodology develops a function-first approach, outlining the key roles of data 
trust as an intermediary in the data economy. Building on this, the framework identifies three 
legislative enablers necessary for creating data trusts that can fulfil these functions. The three 
enablers identified are as follows: 
1. Data protection and rights 
2. Data sharing 
3. Fiduciary obligations 
1. Geographical distribution 
2. Representation of the different legal systems; and 
3. Presence of data protection and sharing frameworks 
However,  given  the  complexity  in  comparing  these  enablers  across  such  diverse  legal  
systems, there were numerous challenges which the later parts of the section chronicle. 
2.1 Building a function-first framework for legal landscaping   
Methodology  
Within  the  ambit  of  data  stewardship  models  - such  as  cooperatives,  unions,  repositories,  exchanges  or  
personal data stores -  data trusts present an explicitly legal challenge. While trust law presents potential as 
an existing legal tool for stewardship, there is a wider legislative environment required for trusts to manage 
data.  As  discussed  above,  aspects  like  fiduciary  responsibility  or  the  subject  matter  of  a  trust  require  
untangling in order to make data trusts feasible. Consequently, differences in various legal systems, their 
foundations -  whether common law, civil code, or mixed -  and their historical contexts complicate such an 
analysis.  
Further,  theoretical  definitions  around  data  trusts  and  the  roles  embedded  within  them  have  been  varied  
since  their  inception  and  continue  to  evolve.  In  order  to  take  the  concept  of  data  trusts  from  abstract  
delineation-via-exclusion,  it  is  necessary  to  arrive  at  the  actionable  features  that  follow  from  theoretical  
definitions  of  role  or  responsibility.  Given  these  challenges,  this  research  has  adopted  a  function-first 
approach to legal analysis. 
Role 
Coalescing various definitions of the role or persona of data trusts informed the first leg of building an analysis 
framework. This has been based also on the consensus statement formulated by the Global Partnership on 
Artificial Intelligence, the works of Lawrence and Delacroix, the Ada Lovelace Institute and more as featured 
in the aforementioned literature review. The primary role of a data trust is to act as a trusted intermediary in 
the move towards a more equitable and agential data economy, particularly for data subjects and generators. 
Along with rebalancing power asymmetries, data trusts and stewards more broadly are envisioned to enable 
data-driven innovation for social benefit, and to preemptively protect subjects from potential vulnerabilities 
that arise from data management. These core ideals can be distilled into the following roles:  

58 
 
 
1. Protect  
Data trusts must work both to preemptively protect beneficiaries from potential harms arising from the use or 
misuse of their data, as well as retroactively ensuring avenues for adequate recourse in the event of harm.  
  
2. Empower  
Protection alone does not necessitate agency. A key duty of a data trust, and of other data stewards, must 
be  to  empower  beneficiaries  through  decision  making,  cognisance  of  data  rights,  and  other  means  of  
participation in their data’s management.
179
 
 
3. G
enerate value 
As part of rebalancing power and value within data economies, data trusts must be primed to further broader 
social and public benefit from data sharing - primarily by promoting data driven innovation and facilitating 
trusted pathways and environments for the same.  
 
4. Negotiate  
The  framework  of  a  trust  creates  a  dynamic  where  trustees  are  enabled  to  negotiate  on  behalf  of  
beneficiaries. This also necessitates a level of skill and expertise in trustees such that they may compensate 
for asymmetries that hinge on the epistemic disadvantages often faced by data subjects.  
 
5. Maintain accountability  
In order for trustees to effectively prioritise beneficiaries interests, it is necessary to codify a high degree of 
accountability toward beneficiaries. This is enabled in part by fiduciary obligations, which entail duties of skill, 
care  and  loyalty  toward  beneficiaries,  and  also  in  allowing  judicial  intervention  upon  the  failure  of  such  
obligations.

 These means differ across different models of stewardship and their governance/participation structures  

59 
 
Role → Function 
In order to evaluate the feasibility of data trusts from a legal lens, it is important to focalise actionable features 
that correlate to the key roles of a trust. This analysis aims at taking structural analyses of data trusts to a 
functional level, and so entailed a delineation of tasks. It is important to note here that despite identifying 
various purposes for data trusts (and consequently, data types and beneficiaries), the functions of the data 
trust remain unchanged.  
1.   Provide clear and usable redressal mechanisms to beneficiaries in the event of misuse or 
harm. 
2.   Establish safeguards and oversight mechanisms to preemptively prevent misuse or harm. 
3.   Provide a platform for collectives to establish trust terms, conditions and constitution.  
4.   Proactively identify and define the subject matter of the trust and its use purpose.  
5.   Enable data sharing and work to make data available for social good through innovation. 
6.   Negotiate the use of trust assets with third parties, and facilitate safe and controlled access 
or use.  
7.   Appoint  expert  trustees  (professional  managers)  as  stewards,  pertaining  to  the  purpose  
scope and data types being managed. 
8.   Instil   transparency   mechanisms   for   accountability   and   loyalty   from   trustees   toward   
beneficiaries.  
In Figure 2.1.1, the correlations across roles and functions are depicted. The primary functions associated 
with data trusts are associated with a necessary level of expertise, trust and accountability. Certain functions 
act to support these features, such as platform creation and the identification of value pathways from data. 
However, it is only through the confluence of all eight that a data trust may be considered primed to fulfil its 
roles. Thus, while the enlisted functions and roles are necessary conditions for a data trust, there may be 
other factors that make up the sufficient conditions. For example, data trusts must be structured with incentive 
models  that  allow  for  sustained  accountability,  and  financial  models  that  allow  for  sustained  revenue  or  
sustenance of the trust. These aspects, discussed further in Section 4, are not necessarily facilitated function-
first,     or     through     legislative     intervention     and thus     do     not     feature     in     our     evaluation.      
 
 
Figure 2.1.1 depicts the roles, functions of a data trust, as well as the embedded correlations between them 

60 
 
Function → Enabler 
Having  identified  the  core  functions  necessary  for  a  data  trust,  there  are  three  legislative  arenas  that  can  
come  together  to  enable  such  functions.  Figure  XX  shows  the  logical  flow  from  function  to  these  three  
foundational enablers, which have each been elucidated below. Since most countries are still evolving their 
data regimes and governance strategies, some of these enablers remain unclear within certain jurisdictions 
-  yet, they are an integral part of the preparation toward data trusts and thus necessary to this evaluation.  
- Data rights and protection  
In order to facilitate any kind of principal protection, intermediaries must be armoured with clear and robust 
digital rights and data protection that will allow them to actionise features around redressal and preemptive 
protection. It is also important to acknowledge that the regulation of data and the rights afforded to individuals 
may  adopt  sector-specific  approaches.  For  instance,  the  USA  regulates  data  processing  through  specific  
laws  such  as  the  Health  Insurance  Portability  and  Accountability  Act  (HIPAA)  and  the  Children's  Online 
Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). While the HIPPA recognises access and portability rights over health data, 
the  COPPA  stipulates  the  processing  limitations  and  consent  requirements  for  children's  data.  In  this  
analysis, data protection features as perhaps the most weighted enabler for data trusts. However, beyond 
individual or collective protection, mature data rights such as portability, findability and accessibility are also 
foundational to such structures. In order for data protection to translate to the intermediary, data rights must 
hold  definitions  around  delegation,  for  trustees  to  be  able  to  manage  data  on  behalf  of  beneficiaries.  As  
discussed above, while many hold that the subject matter of a trust may be the management of rights -  it is 
unclear in  many  jurisdictions  whether  data  rights  (or  their  execution)  are  transferable  at  all,  and  to  what  
extent.  Individual  protection  must  be  coupled  with  individual  autonomy  over  data  and,  for  streamlined  
intermediaries -  clarity on the delegation or exercise of such autonomy.  
- Data sharing  
Beyond data protection and data rights, data trusts are situated within a larger ecosystem of data -  one that 
must be streamlined for data sharing if it is to generate societal value. By many accounts, the eventual vision 
of this ecosystem also includes a plurality of data trusts (for various purposes, types and subjects). Further, 
the function of enabling innovation and making data available also requires this broader network of varied 
data  entities.  Based  on  this,  we  have  considered  in  our  analysis  the  availability  and  lucidity  of  legal  
frameworks for data sharing. This ranges from regulation around data standards, formats, sectoral interplay, 
purpose limitations and sharing agreements -  infrastructure-oriented policy that may seek to build ecosystem-
wide technical capacity. Moves toward nationwide interoperability, data exchange networks, etc are technical 
elements that can work to build trusted networks for data trusts to rely on. In order to efficiently define data 
types  and  purposes  within  a  trust,  legislation  and  broader  policy  efforts  alike  must  also  be  lucid  on  the  
limitations and definitions of aspects like ‘public good,’ or ‘innovation purpose’.  
- Fiduciary obligations  
Common law trusts, which may be considered the parent legal framework for data trusts, have been most 
effectively  buttressed  by  conceptions  of  fiduciary  responsibility.  Fiduciary  duties  under  common  law,  as  
discussed in Section 1, allow for levels of accountability and loyalty that many would argue are difficult to 
institute contractually. Further, fiduciary duty attempts to mitigate and give legislative importance to the power 
asymmetry associated with a delegation of rights, ownership or more -  particularly given the expertise that a 
trustee  retains  in  comparison  to  the  typical  beneficiary.  Thus,  this  has  been  the  third  key  enabler  as  we  
evaluate global jurisdictions. However, there is a marked need to recognise that not all fiduciary duty (across 
jurisdictions)  can  be  read  identically,  and  may  be  very  different  in  implementation.  And  in  the  absence  of  
fiduciary  duty  under  law  (which  is  the  case  for  many  regions  globally)  it  is  important  to  consider  other  
pathways   for   similar   degrees   of   accountability,   loyalty   and   potential   judicial   intervention.   These 
considerations  find  mention  in  our  comparative  analysis  (Section  3)  as  well  as  our  application  of  the  
framework (Section chronicling challenges)

Figure 2.1.2 depicts the move from functions of a data trust, to the 3 key legal enablers that they require 
Enablers → Metrics & Indicators  
Our methodology builds on the three enablers to identify metrics and indicators required to activate the role 
and  functions  of  the  data  trusts.    For  instance,  the  instantiation  of  data  trusts  requires  data  generators  to 
have rights to portability and erasure to transfer or erase their data held by entities or within different data 
trusts in the ecosystem.  The feasibility of data trusts is also contingent upon the jurisdiction’s articulation of 
data sharing principles. Further, policies that articulate purpose and data sharing standards create the right 
ecosystem for data trusts to further their goals by creating avenues for data sharing. Interoperability of data 
also  ensures  that  data  generators  can  exercise  their  rights  to  portability  meaningfully.  Similarly,  ex-ante - 
regulatory oversight -and ex-post mechanisms -  through courts -  are vital to hold data trustees accountable. 
 
Figure 2.1.3 details the metrics and related indicators that have been deployed in assessing jurisdictions across the three 
key enablers

2.2   Selecting jurisdictions - Gating criteria and challenges   
As with the establishment of analysis metrics, the selection for input of jurisdictions formed an integral part 
of  this  evaluation.  GIven  the  nascent  nature  of  such  legal  landscaping,  as  well  as  that  of  evolving  data  
regimes -  there has been no jurisdiction that features a ‘perfect’ analysis, or one that completely addressed 
each of the enablers discussed above. In some cases, this analysis has relied on policy directives or other 
strategic  documents  and  working  consultations  that  have  been  indicative  of  prospective  legislative  or  
regulatory approaches. Thus, our gating criteria (detailed below) for the regions that feature in this analysis 
have been reflexive in application, based on the maturities of various data regimes.  
1.   Geographical representation 
The  selection  has  aimed  to  encapsulate  perspectives  and  contexts  of  a  global  nature.  While  numerous  
academic  initiatives  have  captured  the  movement  of  data  governance  in  more  developed  countries,  it  is  
important to guard against systems that may end up ignoring the needs of a truly global context. Particularly 
for data and its ubiquitous nature, it is increasingly necessary to evaluate the direction and presence of policy 
in countries that may not map to the same levels of capital or technical infrastructure. The unique challenges 
of  earlier  stages  are  not  only  valuable  to  the  assessment  of  feasibility  of  data  trusts,  but  are  important  to  
consider  when  attempting  to  build  structures  of  governance  that  seek  to  empower  communities  across  
borders, and of various societal structures. Thus, our eventual list features nations making up both the Global 
North and South.  
2.   Representation of various legal systems  
While  trust  law  features  most  foundationally  through  common  law  systems,  this  research  has  aimed  to  
evaluate jurisdictions without a limitation to common law. A key gating criteria has been the representation 
of various legal systems including civil codes or mixed legal systems (that are founded on both common and 
civil law structures). In doing so, there have been numerous challenges to the evaluation, given that often 
even matching legal systems operate very distinctly in execution. In the case of fiduciary obligations as well, 
each  region  has  unique  frameworks  and  in  the  case  of  civil  code,  alternative  pathways  to instilling 
accountability and loyalty. Our next section chronicles some of these challenges. 
3.   Presence of data protection and data sharing frameworks 
In order for this analysis to form a basis to future legal review, as well as be indicative of current motions in 
data governance -  the third criteria has been a degree of discourse around data protection and data sharing. 
While  the  majority  of  this  analysis  draws  from  enacted  legislation  or  prospective  legislation  under  
consultation, certain countries present valuable trends and frameworks while still functioning at the level of 
discussion or formulation. We found some of these to be important in this landscaping as they speak to global 
emerging patterns for conceptions of data trusts or intermediaries. 
 
Figure 2.2.1 depicts the jurisdictions selected for this analysis, and the primary criteria applied in this selection 

63 
 
2.3 Chronicling decisions/challenges :   
The bulk of this research deals with differences between various jurisdictions on the issue of data protection, 
rights and avenues for intermediaries. As with any comparative exercise, our selection of these jurisdictions 
and  application  of  the  analysis  framework  faced  numerous  pain  points  that  required  our  approach  to  be  
iterative.  
While  the  aim  of  this  analysis  has  been  to  incorporate  diverse  legal  systems,  it  greatly  complicates  the  
assessment of legal enablers; given that data trusts are conceptualised from common law legal trusts. They 
are  underpinned  most  fundamentally  by  the  fiduciary  duty  of  undivided  loyalty.  With  common  law  trusts  
recognized  in  very  few  civil  law  jurisdictions,  our  framework  has  included  both  civil  legal  systems  that  
recognise trusts (Quebec and South Korea) and civil legal systems that do not (Germany and Brazil). In order 
to provide a landscaping on such countries, we adapted the framework and sought fiduciary-like obligations 
that may inspire or buttress the creation of data trusts.  
The application of gating criteria for jurisdictions too, has remained reflexive and non-linear. For example, 
our selection needed to be cognisant of growing discourse, and not exclusively officialised legislation. In the 
case of Ghana, data-related legislation reflects many regulatory overlaps, and a dearth of codification around 
data sharing or intermediaries. However, given a strong level of political will toward data for public benefit, 
and a considerable shift in private sector receptivity to such regulation -  it became a key focus region for our 
analysis. Additionally, to ensure uniformity in our comparison of legislation, our analysis has narrowed on 
jurisdictions that have or are moving towards federal overarching data protection regulations. This has meant 
the exclusion of the USA from our comparative analysis, which is currently the only OECD country that adopts 
a sectoral approach to regulating the use and processing of data. 
The resultant framework  
Based on the methodology, functions, enablers and metrics detailed above, we arrive at a working framework 
to evaluate the global legal landscape for enabling data trusts. Figure 2.3.1. depicts a ‘preparedness’ scale 
that has been applied to each jurisdiction based on primary analysis of policy approaches and staged. The 
levels  illustrate  the  spectrum  of  clarity  with  which  each  metric  is  defined  in  a  particular  jurisdiction.  The  
enablers are made comprehensive by the four metrics utilised under each of them. 
While the levels illustrate the clarity with which each metric is defined in a particular jurisdiction, the circles 
on the left capture the comprehensiveness of the four metrics under each enabler. For instance, jurisdictions 
that recognise specific personal data rights -   such as access, portability, and erasure -  which are necessary 
for the development and operation of data trusts will place closer to the green shade of the scale, and for 
jurisdictions that have a weak conceptualisation of these data rights will be reflected closer to the left end 
i.e., red bit of the spectrum.  
When interpreting this illustrated framework, it must also be noted that in capturing the recognition of these 
metrics, we must also account for the possibilities or restrictions that play out differently in each jurisdiction. 
It is, therefore, difficult to represent any of these metrics at extreme ends of the spectrum. For instance, while 
the GDPR recognises the right to erasure under Article 17, it is not an absolute right and has limitations as 
to when it can be exercised. Similarly, while some jurisdictions may not legislatively recognise certain rights, 
they may be represented through softer forms of laws such as policies and frameworks.  

64 
 
 
Figure 2.3.1 depicts the analysis framework that will be applied to each region (levels in this figure do not pertain to a 
particular jurisdiction, and are purely illustrative) 
It  is  important  to  note  that  given  the  diverse  nature  of  this  analysis,  and  of  the  jurisdictions  featured,  this  
framework is not intended to be objectively linear or overly prescriptive. Instead, it provides a helpful indicative 
paradigm that the authors hope will be dynamic, and augmented by further research in these arenas, as data 
regimes  make  their  nature  and  outcomes  clearer  over  time.  The  deconstruction  of  new  data  governance  
structures, particularly human-centric structures, requires a level of deconstruction; one that this study has 
approached by function. Section 3 details the comparative legal analysis of each country listed, based on 
this framework, contextualised by the unique status and challenges of each region.  
SECTORAL INSIGHTS : Snapshots from across the globe 
Note: These snippets -  featured here as boxes -  will be scattered across the length of the report as a design 
break from the main content. They are currently placed together for review, but do not form their own section. 
 
Consumer Data Right - Sectoral data sharing in Australia 
Australia has taken collaborative efforts between different regulatory bodies to enable data flow 
across sectors. For instance, Australia’s Consumer Data Right (CDR), a joint effort between the 
Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC), the Office of the Australian 
Information Commissioner (OAIC), and the Data Standards Body (DSB), is currently being rolled 
out to enable consumers to access and transfer their information in standardised formats. CDR 
aims to increase innovation and competition in the banking sector by mandating financial entities 
to share data. Customers have the freedom to share their banking data with competitors to 
compare products and services. The rollout of the CDR will take place in a phased manner, with 
telecommunications and the energy sector as the next identified sectors.

Consent  managers  as  data  intermediaries  – Data  Empowerment  and  
Protection Architecture  
In  India,  Niti  Aayog,  the  government’s  public  policy  think  tank,  has  introduced  the  Data  
Empowerment   and   Protection   Architecture   (DEPA),   as   a   consent-based   data-sharing 
framework that “empowers people to seamlessly and securely access their data and share it 
with  third  party  institutions”.  It  proposes  the  creation  of  ‘consent  managers’,  which  are  
institutions that will mediate interactions between data holders and users.  
 In the financial sector, consent managers take the form of Account Aggregators, which are 
consent dashboards that allow financial entities to share data –   with the user’s consent –   in 
areas  such  as  banking,  insurance,  and  pension.  Essentially,  Account  Aggregators  facilitate  
data  sharing  by  mediating  between  financial  institutions  that  hold  user  data  with  Financial  
Information Users who rely on such information to improve services. 
 
Cross-sectoral data sharing in Ghana 
Ghana’s data collaboration initiative between Vodafone Ghana, Flowminder, and the Ghana 
Statistical  Service  (GSS)  illustrates  a  cross-sectoral  and  problem-specific  approach  to  data  
governance. Under the three-way agreement signed in 2019, GSS receives pseudonymised 
mobile  data  records  from  Vodafone  Ghana,  which  are  aggregated  and  analysed  by  
Flowminder. 
While the data-sharing arrangement was initially conceptualized to contain the spread of Ebola 
virus,  it  is  now  being  used  to  inform  policy  in  the  government’s  response  to  the  COVID-19 
pandemic.  For  instance,  the  analysis  of  aggregated  mobile  data  has  been  relied  on  to  
understand  the  impact  of  pandemic  restrictions  in  population  movements  as  part  of  the  
government’s COVID-19 response efforts.  
 
MyData - South Korea’s sectoral approach to data reuse 
Launched as part of Korea’s Digital New Deal, MyData is an ambitious initiative that aims to 
create a common platform to share data amongst different organisations and the government 
to improve financial, health, and public services. The integration of individuals' data is made 
possible  through  their  national  identification  system  that  issues  every  resident  a  unique  
identification number linked with their biometric data. 
The  platform  will  give  accredited  operators  access  to  consumer  information  to  develop  
innovative financial products through data analysis in the financial sector by obliging financial 
institutions  to  provide  customer  personal  information  through  an  application  programming  
interface (API). The interoperability of data will allow consumers access to all their financial 
information in one place. 
Similarly,  in  the  health  sector,  the  My  HealthWay  app  provides  integrated  management  of 
health  information  from  National  Health  Insurance  records,  Health  Insurance  Review  and  
Assessment Services, and the Disease Control and Prevention Agency. By 2023, the Korean 
Ministry of Health and Welfare aims to provide individuals with all their health records in the 
MyHealthWay app.

European Health Data Space 
Realising  the  potential  of  data  availability  and  reuse,  the  EU  is  pushing  for  common  data  
spaces  in  strategic  sectors  to  create  a  data  sharing  ecosystem.  Health  is  one  such  sector  
where  the  European  Commission  is  currently  building  a  European  Health  Data  Space  in  
collaboration with the EU member states. In line with this, Europe’s joint action Towards the 
European Health Data Space (TEHDAS) project, coordinated by the Finnish Innovation Fund 
Sitra and co-funded by the Health Programme of the European Union, is currently engaging 
with partners from different member states to advance the secondary use of health data. The 
project  focuses  on  governance,  data  quality,  and  infrastructure  requirements  to  support  the  
secondary use of data. 
Additionally, the European Commission has advanced legislative proposals such as the Data 
Governance Act and the Data Act that seek to overcome barriers and legal uncertainties in 
sharing  and  using  data  held  by  public  and  private  actors.  While  the  Data  Act  intends  to  
harmonise the different regulations that pertain to the use and access of private and public 
sector  data,  the  Data  Governance  Act  seeks  to  create  an  overarching  framework  for  data  
sharing through safeguards that develop trusted sharing.

SECTION 3 
The  following  section  of  the  report  builds  on  the  framework  developed  in  section  2  to  conduct  a  
comparative analysis of the following eleven jurisdictions:  
1.   Germany 
2.   England and Wales 
3.   India 
4.   Canada 
5.   South Africa 
6.   South Korea 
7.   Australia 
8.   Singapore 
9.   Kenya 
10.  Brazil 
11.  Ghana 
 
The comparative analysis evaluates the jurisdictions across the three enablers -  data protection and 
rights, data-sharing frameworks, and fiduciary obligations -  identified as necessary for data trusts to 
function. The following takeaways emerge from the comparative analysis: 
● The  appreciation  of  data  rights  and  articulation  of  data  sharing  varies  considerably  across  
different jurisdictions. However, there is still progress in some jurisdictions without formal data 
rights,  seen  in  countries  like  Brazil,  Ghana,  Canada,  India,  and  South  Africa  having  either  
amended existing laws or in the process of enacting new laws to define rights over personal 
data. 
● The analysis found that a number of jurisdictions lacked personal data rights such as portability 
and  erasure.  This  can  create  barriers  for  data  trustees  to  represent  the  interests  of  their  
beneficiaries. 
● Except for legislation and proposals that allow the delegation of consent in a few jurisdictions 
such as South Korea, Canada, and India, most personal data protection laws do not support 
this. 
● While civil law jurisdictions like Germany and Brazil do not recognise fiduciary relationships, 
fiduciary-like  obligations  can  be  created  contractually.  Even  within jurisdictions  that  have  
codified trusts, there is legal uncertainty about whether they can hold rights over data. 
 
3.1 :  Background to Comparative analysis 
Having  arrived  at  this  framework,  the  following  section  carries  out  a  comparative  analysis  of  the  selected  
countries to explore the varying degrees of enablers the identified jurisdictions have in place. As mentioned 
above, the analysis focuses on three primary legal enablers -  data protection and data rights; data sharing 
frameworks, and fiduciary obligations. Similarly, each analysis is buttressed with the scales of preparedness 
based on metrics devised and elucidated earlier.  
Considering the European Union’s role in influencing jurisdictions outside the EU to their approach to data 
sharing and data regulation, the start of this comparative exercise features an overview of the EU's landscape 
on data rights and data sharing. 
  

68 
 
Data protection and sharing in the European Union  
Personal data protection laws in the European Union are primarily covered by the GDPR (the ‘Regulation’). 
The Regulation has been widely influential for its approach to data regulation and the rights afforded to data 
subjects, serving as a lodestar for numerous jurisdictions outside the EU seeking to enact data protection 
laws.  
Chapter  three  of  the  GDPR  covers  the  broad  range  of  rights  available  to  data  subjects,  recognising  eight  
fundamental rights - 
a)   The right to be informed  
b)   The right of access  
c)   The right of rectification  
d)   The right to erasure  
e)   The right to restrict processing  
f)  The right to data portability  
g)   The right to object  
h)   Rights of automated decision making and profiling  
In 2020, the EU released the European Data Strategy
180
 as a policy intervention to create a single market 
for  data  sharing  across  different  sectors.  One  of  the  outcomes  of  this  is  the  proposed  Data  Governance  
Act
181
, which among other regulations, proposes to recognise a new entity - ‘data intermediaries’ - to    manage 
data  flow  between  different  actors  in  the  ecosystem.  However,  the  draft  legislation  is  ambiguous  on  the  
potential for delegation of the personal data  rights conferred under GDPR. While it does not explicitly mention 
data trusts, one of the recitals in the draft legislation states that rights under the GDPR “can only be exercised 
by each individual and cannot be conferred or delegated to a data cooperative”
182
.   
The EU has also taken steps to encourage data sharing and data re-use. One such proposal is the Data Act, 
which aims to incentivise horizontal data flow between organisations across sectors. The proposed legislation 
seeks to define the scope and contours of co-generated data rights among its other objectives. Determining 
the extent of such rights will enable data generators to move their data from one controller to another.

1. Germany  
 
 
a)   Data Protection and Data Rights 
At  the  national  level,  Germany  complemented  the  GDPR
183
  (Regulation)  with  the  German  Federal  Data  
Protection  Act  (BDSG)
184
  and  the Second  Data  Protection  Adaptation  and  Implementation  Act  EU
185
  to 
effectuate open provisions in the GDPR that are left to the member states to define. The BDSG specifies 
general rules and requirements for data processing applicable to the public and private sector. 
While the rights to access, erasure, and portability are instrumental for individuals to move their data (or the 
rights over it) from one data Trust to another, at a foundational level, data Trusts need to have the authority 
to manage data rights. These rights extend to personal data, defined under Article 4(1) of the GDPR as any 
‘information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (‘data subject’)’. Currently, these rights can 
only  be  held  by  data  subjects  as  the  Regulation  does  not  permit  the  transfer  of  data  rights,  nor  does  it  
recognise the collective representation or pooling of these rights. Similarly, it is unclear if there are restrictions 
on  the  transfer  of  rights  to  a  third  party  (data  trust)  through  assignment  of  consent.  Consent  of  the  data  
subject is one of the foundational legal bases for processing personal data under GDPR, and is (as per Article 
6(1) of the Regulation) sought from the data subject for specific identified purposes.

b) Data sharing frameworks  
In recent years, after the enactment of the GDPR, the EU has been exploring ways to regulate and open 
data flows amongst its member states through legislation like the amended Open Data Directive
187
 and the 
Regulation  on  the  free  flow  of  non-personal  data  (FFD)
188
.  In  line  with  this,  the  German  government  
announced their data strategy on January 21st, 2021 to promote data usage. The strategy prioritises four 
fields to enable this: 
1.   C
reating effective and sustainable digital infrastructure  
2.   Innovative and responsible use of data 
3.   Increasing digital literacy  
4.   Improve the state’s digital infrastructure and capacity  
To this end, the German government has established a National Research Data Infrastructure to improve 
access  to  data  for  research.
189
  This  is  also  in  addition  to  the    GAIA-X
190
,  which  is  a  federated  data  
infrastructure that aims to create a digital ecosystem across Europe. Backed strongly by France and Europe, 
the move will create interoperable standards that will allow the movement of data across different silos. The 
initiative is also viewed as an attempt to assert Europe’s digital sovereignty.
191
 
c)   Fiduciary obligations 
As  highlighted  in  sections  above,  in  English  law,  fiduciary  duties  - as  in  the  case  of  trusts  -    developed 
distinctly through principles of equity, imposing a stricter standard of care of one party. English law takes the 
view  that  contracts  are  self-interested  relationships  where  each  party  pursues  only  their  own  interests.  
Germany, having a civil legal system, does not make this distinction in recognising fiduciary duties. These 
duties  are,  in  fact,  embedded  contractually  or  through  specific  statutes  that  identify  relationships  that  
necessitate the recognition of fiduciary duties, thereby existing in a continuum and not separately.
192
  
One such mechanism is the treuhand. In a treuhand, the transferor transfers their assets (and its ownership) 
to the trustee.
193
 However, while the ownership rests with the trustee, the trustee is bound by ‘mandate’, a 
type  of  agency  relationship.  Mandate  is  a  legal  relationship that  permits  one  party  to  represent  or  act  on  
behalf of the other.
194
 It remains unclear whether data trusts can be recognised in this relationship. 
Moreover, courts can only intervene only where such obligations arise contractually or through the operation 
of these specific statutes. However, even then, courts in civil legal systems may not have the same flexibility 
to evaluate decision-making of trustees in polycentric aspects that arise in the administration of trusts.

Key takeaways 
From  our  exploration  of  Germany’s  legal  landscape,  it  becomes  clear  that  Europe’s  approach  towards  
recognising rights over personal data and articulating data sharing is robust compared to other jurisdictions. 
With efforts underway to develop interoperable standards for data spaces across Europe, in the health sector, 
for instance, data trusts have the potential to tap into these infrastructures to represent the collective interests 
of  beneficiaries.  However,  GDPR’s  current  conceptualisation  of  rights  over  personal  data  does  not  
acknowledge the rights to mandate individual rights over data, which greatly hinders the possibility of setting 
up data trust-like initiatives. .  
While Germany does not distinguish fiduciary duties in the same way as English law, it does recognise similar 
obligations  contractually,  allowing  courts  to  intervene  in  disputes  arising  in  the  performance  of  these  
obligations. However, reliance on contractual obligations can create difficulties for representing rights, which 
requires specific contractual relationships with each individual wishing to participate in a data trust. Similarly, 
the absence of a legal trust framework requires either the adoption of existing structures such as companies 
or associations, or the recognition of a new class of intermediaries that can carry out the functions of a data 
trust. 
The  Opinion  of  Data  Ethics  Commission  recognises  great  potential  in  data  management  and  data  trust  
schemes to empower individuals to take control over their personal data. The commission also recognises 
the “Right to digital self determination” and is against the idea of data ownership and believes that contribution 
to  generation  of  data  must  lead  to  “  data  specific  rights  of  co-determination  and  participation”  which  is  
dependent on several factors. The Commission also recommends clarification of S.311 of the German Civil 
Code  to  include  quasi-contractual  duties  which  are  fiduciary  in  nature  for  data  controllers.  These  
recommendations show that Germany is attempting to codify fiduciary obligations and adopting data trust-
like schemes. 
2. England and Wales 
 

72 
 
a)   Data Protection and Data Rights 
Post-Brexit, the UK was categorised as a third country by the EU under the GDPR
195
. However, the free flow 
of information continues to occur through a decision adopted by the EU on the adequacy of protection of 
personal data by the United Kingdom
196
. The UK Data Protection Act 2018
197
 was legislated to adopt the EU 
GDPR, with minor procedural and cosmetic amendments. It, therefore, recognises the same rights for data 
subjects -  as discussed above -  set out under the EU GDPR
198
. Unless data is anonymised completely, data 
trusts in both the EU and the UK will have to ensure that processing is carried under one of the six lawful 
bases for processing data. 
b) D
ata sharing frameworks 
In 2020, the UK government published the National Data Strategy
199
 to explore opportunities and avenues 
for  data  use.  In  line  with  this,  the  government  identified  four  pillars  -    foundations,  skills,  availability  and  
responsibility -  that align to its actions or ‘missions’. The five missions are to: unlock the value of data across 
the economy; secure a pro-growth and trusted data regime; transform government’s use of data; ensure the 
security and resilience of its data infrastructure, and engage in the international flow of data.
200
 
To  advance  the  aims  set  out  in  the  National  Data  Strategy,  the  Centre  for  Data  Ethics  and  Innovation  
published  an  independent  report,  commissioned  by  the  Department  for  Digital  Culture,  Media,  and  Sport  
(DCMS),  to  explore  ways  in  which  data  intermediaries  could  support  data  sharing.
201
  Identifying  existing  
organisations  that  play  the  role  of  data  intermediaries  in  the  current  digital  economy,  the  report  suggests  
ways in which intermediaries can enhance the value of publicly and privately available data. 
O
n 10 September 2021, as part of one of its missions to “secure a pro-growth and trusted data regime”, the 
government  launched  a  consultation  to  reform  its  data  protection  laws.
202
  The  proposal  seeks  to  remove  
barriers in the current General Data Protection Regulation (UK GDPR) to support “vibrant competition and 
innovation  to  drive  economic  growth”.
203
  Equally,  the  Department  for  Digital,  Culture,  Media  and  Sport  
(DCMS) has proposed broadening the remit of the Information Commissioner's Office to “champion sectors 
and  businesses  that  are  using  personal  data  in  new,  innovative  and  responsible  ways  to  benefit  people’s  
lives” in areas such as healthcare and financial services
204
. 
c)   Fi
duciary Obligations  
Fiduciary principles in English common law can be traced back to the courts of equity in Medieval England 
which typically relied on notions of undivided loyalty and good faith to recognise ownership of property held 
in trusts. Until the 19th century, remedies from common law and equity were distinctly applicable. In 1873, 
the Parliament passed the Judicature Act that merged the Court of Chancery and Court of Law to the High 
Court, which applies either principle as applicable
205
. Therefore, the law of trusts and fiduciary was purely a 
creation of the Court of Chancery institutionalised into common law.  
T
rusts are typified by a fiduciary relationship between the trustee and the trust’s beneficiaries. Unlike other 
fiduciary  relationships  - a  doctor  and  a  patient  or  a  director  and  the  company,  for  instance  - trustees  are  
bound  by  stricter  standards  of  loyalty  and  a  duty  of  care/prudence.  Trustees  who  fail  to  uphold  these

principles can be removed from office, surcharged, or enforced to disgorge profits. This counteracts potential 
ex-post disputes, which often arise in agency relationships where agents engage in self-dealing.  
Key takeaways 
Naturally, trusts' institutional and legal origins in England and Wales make it the most suitable for instantiating 
data trusts through trust law. Additionally, the influence of GDPR in the UK’s recognition of rights of access, 
portability, and erasure creates a suitable ecosystem for developing a plurality of data trusts.  
However, given the different rules that can apply to data, there needs to be legislative certainty across various 
sectors  for  data  trusts  to  access  and  use  data  meaningfully.  For  instance,  the  proposed  Data  Act  in  the  
European Union aims to bring legal certainty by harmonising the different regulations –   e.g., database rights, 
trade secrets –   that can affect the access and use of data.  
Although trusts traditionally lack regulatory oversight, charitable trusts in the UK fall within the remit of the 
Charity Commission. Given current attempts to pilot data trusts in the UK, the scope and requirements for 
ex-ante regulation for the functioning of data trusts is a potential safeguard mechanism worth considering. 
3. India  
 
a)   Data protection and Data Rights 
While India recognises the fundamental right to privacy within Article 21
206
 (right to life and liberty), it is still 
yet to enact dedicated data protection legislation. Currently, data protection is regulated by the Information 
                                                      
206  Article 21 of the Constitution of India 

74 
 
Technology Act, 2000 (IT Act), and the rules under it
207
. For instance, the distinction between personal data 
and sensitive personal data is made in the IT (Reasonable Security Practices and Procedures and Sensitive 
Personal  Data  or  Information)  Rules  framed  under  the  IT  Act  (SPDI  Rules)
208
.  Section  43A  of  the  IT  Act  
grants individuals the right to claim compensation for wrongful loss if body corporates do not have reasonable 
security measures in place. SPDI rules define personal information as any information that relates to a natural 
person which, either directly or indirectly, in combination with other available or likely available information, 
may identify that person
209
. 
While the IT Act’s conception of data protection is quite limited in scope, only recognising consent, access, 
and correction rights, the proposed Personal Data Protection Bill (PDPB)
210
, drafted in the backdrop of the 
landmark judgement that recognised the right to privacy
211
, extends additional rights like the right to erasure 
and portability. The PDP Bill also envisages giving data principals the right to delegate the exercise of their 
agency (provide or withdraw consent) to a new category of data fiduciaries termed as consent managers
212
. 
Concurrently, the Indian Government has also published a report on the regulation of non-personal data. It 
proposes collective privacy rights over non-personal data in contrast to the framing of rights over personal 
data, where the individual is the focal point.  
b) Data sharing frameworks  
In  recent  years,  NITI  Aayog,  the  Indian  government’s  public  policy  think  tank,  has  mooted  techno-legal 
approaches to enhance access to and sharing of data. The proposed Data Empowerment and Protection 
Architecture  (DEPA)
213
,  for  instance,  is  public-private  collaboration  that  builds  on  the  concept  of  consent  
managers to create a platform that allows data transfers from one entity to another. The finance sector and 
health  sector  have  already  made  some  inroads  through  the  adoption  of  ‘account  aggregators’  and  the  
National Health Stack
214
.   
At the same time, there are proposals to create interoperable sharing infrastructure for non-personal data.
215
 
The  report  on  the  Non-Personal  Data  Governance  Framework  (the  “NPDR”)  report  recognises  beneficial  
interests  over  community  data.  The  committee  identifies  five  key  principles  to  ascertain  community  rights  
over data: (i) a community’s right over resources associated collectively with it; (ii) consent of the community 
for use of such resources; (iii) benefit sharing with the community; (iv) transparency in recording community 
resources to prevent misuse and enable easy access of the legitimate kind; and (v) community’s participation 
in governance of community resources.
216
 The NPDR also recommends the creation of ‘data trustees’ as  
intermediaries to exercise rights on behalf of the group/community. The committee sources this community 
right  from  Article  39(b)  and  (c)  of  the  Indian  Constitution  (Directive  Principles  of  State  Policy)
217
  which 
stipulates that the ownership and control of resources ought to be distributed to serve the common good and 
to prevent the concentration of wealth.

c)   Fiduciary obligations  
Fiduciary obligations concerning trust law in India are primarily codified in the Indian Trusts Act 1882 (‘Trusts 
Act’)
218
. Fiduciary obligations can also be located in other relationships, such as an agent to a principal and 
directors to their company. In the Supreme Court case of the Reserve Bank of India v. Jayantilal N. Mistry
219
, 
the court observed that fiduciaries owe “undivided loyalty to the beneficiary, not to place himself in a position 
where his duty towards one person conflicts with a duty that he owes to another customer". 
T
he  Trusts  Act  pertains  to  private  trusts,  which  are  essentially  trusts  with  clearly  identified  beneficiaries.  
Public trusts must be created for charitable, educational, religious or scientific purposes and be for the benefit 
of  a  specific  class  or  the  general  public.  The  Trusts  Act  recognises  obligations  such  as  loyalty,  care,  and  
prudence through various provisions that impose duties and liabilities on trustees. For instance, section 14 
of the Act requires the trustee to ensure that the title of the trust property is not dealt with (self dealing or 
otherwise) in a manner that adversely affects the beneficiary.
220
 Similarly, section 15 mandates the trustee 
to deal with the trust property “a man of ordinary prudence would deal with such property if it were his own''.
221
  
However, the subject-matter of a trust must be property that is transferable to the trust.
222
 The development 
of case law on the scope of the subject-matter is limited. It is, therefore, unclear,  data (or the rights over it) 
can constitute as the subject matter of trusts under Indian law.  Moreover, unlike in English law, the Indian 
Trusts Act does not recognise the concept of dual-ownership. Beneficiaries only have a beneficial interest 
against the trustee, who is the sole owner of the trust property. 
Key takeaways 
Although restricted to non-personal data, India’s Non-Personal Data Governance Framework report offers a 
unique articulation of data trustees to manage community rights over data. The report proposes data trustees 
as intermediaries representing and protecting the community's interests by recognising collective rights over 
privacy. However, the current framework does not identify procedural safeguards or mechanisms that can 
hold trustees accountable. 
While India has codified trusts and trustee's fiduciary responsibilities, the feasibility for legal trusts to hold 
data rights as the subject matter lacks legal certainty. Moreover, in the absence of dedicated data protection 
legislation,  India’s  recognition  of  individual  rights  over  personal  data  remains  weak,  further  restricting  the  
possibility of data trusts' to act as intermediaries.

4. Canada  
 
 
a)   Data protection and Data rights 
Data protection in Canada is governed by a mix of general and sector-specific legislation, both at a federal 
and provincial level.
223
 At the federal level, Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act 
2000 (PIPEDA)
224
 regulates the private organisations’ use of personal data and the Privacy Act
225
 governs 
the public sector’s use of personal data. The legislation was amended several times since it was first enacted 
in  2000,  the most  significant  amendment  being  the  Digital  Privacy  Act
226
  in  2015  which  expanded  the  
Information  Commissioner’s  powers  and  introduced  mandatory  breach  notification.  Under  the  current  
framework, individuals have limited right to access and seek correction of their personal data.
227
 
On November 17, 2020, the federal government tabled the Digital Charter Implementation Act
228
 to overhaul 
the  current  privacy  legislation.  The  Act  introduces  substantial  changes  to  the  current  privacy  framework,  
including  the  new  Consumer  Privacy  Protection  Act  (CPPA),  which  seeks  to  regulate  privacy  laws  in  the  
                                                      
223 Quebec, British Columbia, and Alberta have their own provincial statutes.

private sector
229
. In addition to the existing rights to access and correction, the Bill introduces rights of erasure 
and portability.  
b) D
ata sharing frameworks  
At the governmental level, machine readable public sector data is made available for reuse under its Open 
Government  Initiative.
230
  Only  data  that  is  safe,  legally  permissible,  and  not  identifiable  to  individuals  is  
shared. Departments of the government also have a sectoral approach to data sharing. The Pan-Canadian 
Health  Data  Strategy,  for  instance,  empowers  the  Corporate  Services  Branch  (CSB)  and  the  Business  
Renewal  and  Enterprise  Architecture  Directorate  (BREAD)  “to  effectively  use  data  as  an  asset  to  provide  
credible information, reliable advice and quality services”
231
. 
Additionally  there  have  been  efforts  at  a  cross-sectoral  level  to  increase  data  sharing  by  improving  
interoperability of data. For instance, in 2019, the Standards Council of Canada constituted the Canadian 
Data  Governance  Standardization  Collaborative  (DGSC),  comprising  over  200  members  of  stakeholders  
from various industries, civil society, and academia to streamline data standardization practices by keeping 
all stakeholders in mind
232
. 
c)   Fi
duciary obligations 
Canada’s  influence  of  both  civil  and  common  law  origins  makes  it  a  unique  jurisdiction  of  study.  While  
common  law  in  Canada  extends  fiduciary  duties  beyond  trustee  and  beneficiary  relationships,  civil  law  in  
Quebec does not recognise these fiduciary relationships. Like many civil law jurisdictions, the Quebec Civil 
Code codifies obligations of good faith and loyalty within contractual relationships.
233
 
Except in Quebec, which has civil law trusts, provinces of Canada have common law origins of trusts. And 
in contrast to common law trusts, which are based on the principle of ownership with obligation owed by the 
trustees towards its beneficiaries, trusts in Quebec are concerned with the advancement of a purpose through 
the administration of appropriated property.
234
 The underlying principle of civil trusts is that the question of 
ownership does not arise; trusts and its administration is defined by the purpose it seeks to achieve.
235
 The 
settlor determines the purpose (in the case of data trusts, individuals, or organizations seeking to share their 
data). 
236
 In both civil and common law trusts, trustees owe fiduciary duties of diligence, prudence, and loyalty. 
Moreover, settlers, beneficiaries, and ‘interested persons of interest’ have the right to institute proceedings 
against the trustee if trustees fail to comply with their obligations.

Key takeaways 
In comparison with other jurisdictions, Canada’s recognition of trusts is unique, with the presence of both civil 
and common law trusts.  The Civil Code of Quebec offers flexibility to create data trusts for a wide range of 
purposes by recognising the creation of trusts for commercial and non-commercial purposes. Furthermore, 
the absence of ownership requirements for Quebec civil trusts means that the question of ownership of data 
to represent rights over data trusts does not arise. 
However,  at  present,  Canadian  laws  do  not  confer  personal  data  rights  of  portability  and  erasure.  The  
absence of these rights poses challenges to sustain an ecosystem of data trusts that can meaningfully make 
decisions on the personal data of individuals held by entities. Although Quebec’s recently adopted Bill-64 
recognises the right to portability, it will only come into force in 2024. Similarly, the proposed Digital Charter 
also moots recognizing the right to portability and a limited right of erasure. 
From interactions with experts, we observed a marked push at an ecosystem level from both the public and 
private  sector  to  explore  different  data  stewardship  models  in  Canada.  Aside  from  Ontario’s  attempts  to  
create urban data trusts, the potential for data trusts as a form of data stewardship is being investigated by 
public and private actors across Canada.

a)   Data protection and data rights 
Like India, the right to privacy as a fundamental right is constitutionally recognised within the South African 
Constitution’s  Bill  of  Rights
239
.  However,  it  was  only  on  July  1st  2020,  that  the  country’s  data  protection  
legislation,  Protection  of  Personal  Information  Act  2013  (POPIA),  came  into  effect
240
.  The  POPIA  grants  
individuals  the  right  to  access  and  request  correction  or  erasure  of  their  personal  data.  Additionally,  
individuals also have the right not to be subject to decisions that are made solely on the basis of automated 
processing of their personal information.
241
. 
The legislation also contains provisions that allow individuals to approach the data protection regulator or 
courts where individuals feel that there has been an interference with the protection of their personal data. 
b) Data sharing frameworks  
In  tandem  with  its  data  protection  law  reform,  the  South  African  government  has  also  published  the  Draft  
National Data and Cloud Policy as a bid “to realise the socio-economic value of data through the alignment 
of  existing  policies,  legislation  and  regulation”
242
.  The  policy  applies  to  the  public  and  private  sector,  and  
makes  recommendations  on  various  issues,  ranging  from  access  to  data,  cross-border  data  transfers,  
competition in the digital economy, and digital infrastructure. Seen as a response to the growing concerns of 
concentration of data under the control of tech corporations
243
, through data localisation proposals, the policy 
emphasizes asserting sovereignty over data generated within the country. 
E
qually,  there are  also  sector-specific  approaches  being  taken  to  promote  data  sharing.  One  of  the  
interventions of the National Digital Health Strategy for South Africa
244
 is to enhance data use in the health 
sector  through  data  sharing  agreements  with  third  party  health information  systems.  The  digital  health  
strategy also prioritises the creation of an “integrated platform and architecture for health sector information 
systems” that will provide interoperable connection with patient information systems.  
South Africa follows a mixed legal system, with Roman-Dutch and English law origins, and is evidenced in 
their recognition of trusts.
245
 However, like with the Indian conception, South African law does not recognise 
English law’s dual ownership of the trust property.
246
 Therefore, trust law was, therefore, codified through the 
Trust Property Control Act 1988 (TPCA)
247
, recognising trusts where the ownership either lies with the trustee 
(English  influence)  or  where  the  trustee  manages  assets  that  are  bequeathed  to  the  beneficiaries  (Dutch  
influence).
248
 
The TPCA imposes duties of care, skill and diligence, trustees duties of loyalty are specified in the statute. 
However, the principles governing fiduciary actions are derived from equitable principles of English law, and 
the duty of impartiality
249
 is implicit in the responsibilities of a trustee.
250
 The TPCA grants courts discretion

Key takeaways 
While South Africa’s Trust Property Control Act presents flexibility by allowing the creation of trusts where 
ownership of property lies with the beneficiary, there are key challenges that arise in the development of data 
trusts. 
First, given the recency in enacting regulations over the use of personal data, the scope and applicability of 
rights over personal data in South Africa are still underexplored. The absence of data portability rights and 
the limited recognition of the right to erasure, for instance, could create barriers for trustees to advance the 
interests  of  the  beneficiaries.  Second,  the  development  of  data  trusts  requires  clarity  on  whether  POPIA  
allows trustees as third parties to manage individual’s rights over their personal data.  
6. South Korea 
 
 
a)   Data protection and Data rights 
As one of the most connected jurisdictions, South Korea (Korea) was quite early in legislating comprehensive 
regulations  on  the  use  of  data.  The  regulation  of  personal  data  is  governed  by  the  Personal  Information  
Protection Act 2011 (PIPA)
252
. The legislation extends to both public and private actors. In addition to the 
                                                      
251 Section 13 of the Trust Property Control Act 
252Personal Information Protection Act, 2011.  
See https://www.privacy.go.kr/eng/laws_view.do?nttId=8186&imgNo=3 

81 
 
PIPA, there are sector specific laws around health, finance, and e-commerce that govern the use and sharing 
of  information  such  as  the  Act  on  Promotion  of  Information  and  Communications  Network  Utilization  and  
Information  Protection  2001  ('ICNA';  also  known  as  Network  Act),  and  the  Credit  Information  Use  and  
Protection Act 2008 ('the Credit Information Act'). While the PIPA grants individuals with data rights such as 
access, correction, erasure, it currently does not recognise data portability rights.  
In  2020,  the  National  Assembly  made  amendments  to  the  three  major  privacy  legislation  - the  PIPA,  the  
ICNA and the Credit Information Act -  to streamline the application of data protection laws
253
. While ICNA 
operates  as  a  specialised  legislation,  provisions  of  the  ICNA  pertaining  to  personal  information  were  
subsumed into the PIPA.  
I
nterestingly,  Article  38  of  PIPA  allows  individuals  to  authorise  representatives  to  file  requests  to  access,  
correct, erase or suspend data processing on behalf of the individual.
254
  
b) D
ata sharing frameworks  
Policy makers in Korea were comparatively early in identifying data sharing strategies, with most government 
processes digitised during the previous decade. In June 2020, through a major policy initiative, called the 
Digital New Deal, the Korean government announced several measures to strengthen its digital infrastructure 
and cloud computing and increase the convergence between 5G and AI
255
. One of the measures is the ‘Data 
Dam’ project, which includes various methods for data standardisation, processing, and utilisation
256
. The 
Digital Deal also proposes to build new platforms under the ‘MyData’ initiative. These platforms aim to support 
citizens and provide services across healthcare, public services, finance, and transportation.  
K
orea,  through  its  data  protection  laws,  however,  attempts  to  implement  data  localisation  practices.  For  
instance, transferring personal information abroad requires data controllers to notify and obtain consent from 
the data subject. Additionally, restrictions are imposed on transferring information to organisations based in 
jurisdictions that have restricted the transfer of personal information abroad.  
c)   Fiduciary obligations 
Korea codified trusts through the Korean Trust Act 1961
257
 In 2009, after extensive deliberations by the trust 
law reform committee, the 1961 legislation was replaced by the Trust Act 2011
258
 to govern private trusts. It 
defines trusts as a legal relationship where the trustor “transfers a specific piece of property (including part 
of business or an intellectual property right) to a person who accepts the trust,... and requires the trustee to 
manage, dispose of, operate, or develop such property or engage in other necessary conduct to fulfill the 
purpose  of  the  trust,  for  the  benefit  of  a  specific  person  or  for  a  specific  purpose,  based  on  a  confidence  
relation  between  the  truster  and  the  trustee”
259
.  The  legislation  adopts  a  broad  framing  of  property  which  
could allow personal rights to form the subject matter of trusts.   
C
hapter IV of the Trust Act codifies various duties of a trustee such as the duty of care, the duty of loyalty, 
and the duty of impartiality. Moreover, a trustee should not benefit from their position or put themselves in a 
position having a conflict of interest. Beneficiaries have personal rights  against their trustees.
260
 Under article 
43(3) of the Trust Act, if the trustee is found to be in breach of their duties, beneficiaries can disgorge any 
benefits made by the trustee, irrespective of whether the trustee has caused damage to the trust property. 
Similarly, unauthorised transfers may be rescinded, if a third-party knew or should have known the illegitimate

nature of the transfer.
261
 Fiduciary relationships are also recognised in corporate structures, by which duties 
are imposed on directors/managers and investment business entities.   
Key takeaways 
South Korea is one of the few civil jurisdictions in South-east Asia that has codified trusts, and trustees’ duties 
of care, loyalty, and impartiality.  The PIPA is one of the few legislation that allows representatives to act on 
their behalf to exercise individuals rights over personal data. However, for the development of data trusts, 
data protection laws must bring about legal certainty on whether such rights to personal data can form the 
subject matter of these trusts. 
While Korea has enacted comprehensive laws to regulate data use and sharing, it currently only recognises 
access, erasure, and correction rights. The proposed amendment to the PIPA is expected to define a new 
right  to  data  portability.  Along  with  the  proposed  PIPA  amendment,  there  have  also  been  advances  in  
facilitating cross-sectoral sharing and policy-based approaches to data standardisation as part of the Digital 
New Deal. While initiatives such as MyData seek to increase the control which individuals have over their 
personal  data,  it  remains  to  be  seen  how  it  incorporates  procedural  safeguards  and  accountability  
mechanisms. 
7.    Australia 
 
a)   Data Protection and Data Rights 
Australia was one of the early countries that passed the Privacy Act 1988
262
 to align with the OECD guidelines 
on the Protection of Privacy and Transborder Flows of Personal Data
263
. It gives individuals various rights 
such as the right to know why personal information is being collected and to whom it will be disclosed; the 
                                                      
261 Article 75(1) of the Trust Act 2011 
262 Privacy Act 1988, see https://www.legislation.gov.au/Series/C2004A03712 
263OECD (2013), “OECD Guidelines on the Protection of Privacy and Transborder Flows of Personal Data - OECD.” Available at:

83 
 
right  to  access  one’s  personal  information;  reject  unwanted  direct  marketing,  and  the  right  to  make  a  
complaint.
264
 However, there is no private right of action against data controllers available to individuals. 
The Australian Privacy Principles (APP) form the foundation of the privacy protection framework of the Act
265
. 
They apply to all entities the Act covers and governs the standards, rights and obligations around collection; 
use  and  disclosure  of  personal  information;  the  entity’s  governance  and  accountability;  integrity  and  
correction of personal information and individual’s rights to access their personal information
266
.   
b) Data sharing frameworks  
Following Europe and Canada, as a means to encourage data use for economic benefit, Australia released 
its first Data Strategy for 2021 to 2025
267
. The strategy seeks to strengthen effective, safe and secure data 
use. Amongst other functions, the strategy will also outline the government’s frameworks surrounding data 
sharing and custodianship of both public and private data in Australia. Additionally, the government initiative 
plans to incorporate inter-agency (government) collaboration in order to promote data maturity, visibility and 
capability  in  the  Australian  Public  Service
268
.  As  part  of  their  data-driven  innovation  approach,  the  Data  
Strategy is set out to construct a framework to improve data sharing mechanisms, data access management 
and bolster participation between government and businesses. In order to achieve this, the government looks 
at the possibility of incorporating Consumer Data Right and relevant institutions to establish a data-driven 
economy
269
. 
There are some intra-jurisdiction data sharing channels in place in Australian jurisdiction at varying levels 
such as the Multi-Agency Data Integration Project (MADIP) which integrates datasets from five jurisdictions 
-   the  Australian  Bureau  of  Statistics;  the  Australian  Taxation  Office;  Department  of  Education,  Skill  and  
Employment; Department of Health; Department of Social Services and Services Australia
270
.   
Recently, the Australian government tabled Data Availability and Transparency Bill 2020
271
 and, if passed, 
will allow greater sharing of public sector data with accredited users -  either from public or private sectors for 
the purposes of improving government sector delivery, informing, and evaluating government policy and to 
support research and development. This will be permissible only if it is in accordance with the data sharing 
principles and governed by a data sharing agreement.
272
 
c)    Fi
duciary Obligations 
In Australia, duties owed by fiduciaries are determined as per the nature of the relationship.
273
 However, at 
the heart of these fiduciary relationships, the fiduciary undertakes to act on behalf of or in the interests of 
another person.
274
 Trusts in Australia largely follow principles of English trust law, with some variance codified 
through  legislation.  However,  the  fiduciary  duty  of  loyalty  and  no-conflict  are  foundational  to  these  
relationships.  In  Australia,  charitable  trusts  are  regulated  by  the  Australian  Charities  and  Not-for-profits 
Commission.
275
 A charitable trust must be for a not-for-profit purpose that benefits the public. 
Australia’s  data  sharing  frameworks  take  up  a  more  comprehensive  scope  because  of  their  robust  inter-
sectoral data sharing mechanisms and recognition of data intermediaries through the Consumer Data Right.

However, rights to portability and erasure are absent under the current data protection laws, creating barriers 
for  individuals  to  withdraw  their  data  from  data  holders.  While  Australia  has  delineated  duties  owed  by  
trustees towards beneficiaries, fiduciary duties are prophylactic.  
Key takeaways 
While trusts in Australia primarily follow principles of English law, the absence of certain rights over personal 
data,  such  as  portability  and  erasure  of  data,  will  restrict  data  trusts  from  managing  the  rights  of  the  
beneficiaries effectively. Alternatively, through the recent Consumer Data Right (CDR), the government is 
developing data sharing mechanisms that recognise a form of data portability right. CDR mandates entities 
in sectors to make consumer’s data available to ease restrictions on accessing and sharing data. Consumers 
can then decide which providers they wish to share this data with.  Currently, CDR has been implemented in 
the banking sector and is expected to roll out gradually across the various sectors.  
Although current regulations under the CDR are silent on the representation of rights by third parties, there 
is potential to recognise data trusts as a new class of intermediaries that can manage the interests of the 
users while being bound by fiduciary obligations that are applicable to trustees. 
8. Singapore 
 
a)   Data protection and Data rights 
The  regulation  of  personal  data  and  the  rights  conferred  to  individuals  are  defined  in  the  Personal  Data  
Protection Act (PDPA), which came into force in 2013.
276
 In addition to the PDPA, which is the overarching 
personal data protection law, there are other sector specific legislation like the Banking Act and the Insurance 
Act that regulate use of personal information. 
T
hrough flexible consent mechanisms, the PDPA seeks to balance the interests of individuals and the private 
sector.
277
 PDPA creates exemptions from requiring consent when processing "is necessary for any purpose 
                                                      
276 See https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/Overview-of-PDPA/The-Legislation/Personal-Data-Protection-Act> 
277 ibid. 

85 
 
which  is  clearly  in  the  interests  of  the  individual  or  if  the  individual  would  not  reasonably  be  expected  to  
withhold consent." Additionally the PDPA confers rights to access, correction, and portability to individuals.
278
 
b) D
ata sharing frameworks  
Data sharing in Singapore is primarily driven by government efforts and investment in building digital capacity. 
For  instance,  the  Digital  Government  Blueprint  -    five  year  plan  put  forward  by  Smart  Nation  and  Digital  
Government  Group  - prioritises  building  open  data  platforms  which  use  open  application  programming  
interfaces  (APIs)  and  open  standards  for  interoperability.
279
  Similarly,  AI  Singapore,  a  government  wide  
partnership, brings together research institutions  across the country to boost its AI capabilities. Additionally, 
the programme’s Model AI Governance Framework provides guidance to the private sector organizations to 
address  key  ethical  and  governance  issues  for  AI  related  solutions.  The  ‘Implementation  and  Self-
Assessment  Guide’  helps  organisations  assess  the  alignment  of  their  AI  governance  practices  to  the  
framework.
280
 
To boost sharing and re-use of data in the private sector, Infocomm Development Authority and the Personal 
Data Protection Commission (PDPC) introduced the Trusted Data Sharing Framework. It focuses on aspects 
that  can  guide  commercial  and  non-governmental  sectors  to  enhance  data  sharing  within  the  ecosystem.  
The  framework  covers  four  aspects,  namely,  data-sharing  strategy;  legal  and  regulatory  considerations;  
technical and organisation considerations; and operationalising data sharing.
281
  
Regulatory  approaches  to  data  protection  have  also  attempted  to  encourage  innovation  in  emerging  
technologies. This can be seen in the PDPC’s flexibility to data protection, wherein it grants exemptions -  on 
a case-by-case basis -  to obligations under the PDPA for the development of new technologies.
282
 
c)   Fiduciary obligations 
Singapore’s legal system derives heavily from the English common law system, and therefore recognises 
common law conceptions of trusts and fiduciaries. While English law cases continue to hold relevance, their 
legal system has also codified some of the common law principles of trust and equity in the Trustees Act 
(Chapter  337)
283
  and  the  Business  Trusts  Act.
284
  Singapore  views  fiduciary  duties  as  proscriptive  and  
prophylactic, placing emphasis on the duty of loyalty and avoiding conflicts of interest.
285
 Under Singapore 
law,  the  main  financial  remedies  available  to  the  beneficiary  are  equitable  compensation  and  account  of  
profits

.   
Unlike traditional trusts, business trusts import corporate governance-like mechanisms in the trust structure. 
A  key  difference  is  that  the  role  of  trustees  is  replaced  by  trustee-managers,  which  must  be  registered  
corporations.
287
 Although trustee-managers are not defined as fiduciary in nature, the duties are similar to 
ordinary trustees. So, while trustee-managers are required to act in the best interests of all the unitholders 
as a whole, they are required to prioritise the interests of the trusts over theirs only if it "conflicts with the 
interests of all the unitholders as a whole".
288
 Like most corporate regulations, the Business Trusts Act seeks 
to  ensure  accountability  by  imposing  obligations  on  trustee-managers  to  conduct  audits  and  hold  annual  
general  meetings.  The  registration  and  functioning  of  business  trusts  is  also  regulated  by  the  Monetary  
Authority of Singapore.

Key takeaways 
Singapore's data-sharing frameworks are considerably more robust, with defined data-sharing mechanisms 
in the public and private sectors. In recent years, the discourse has also moved around data standardisation 
and recognition of data intermediaries, with the regulator encouraging data reuse for economic activity. 
The flexibility of trusts in Singapore to engage in a wide range of activities and the recognition of rights over 
data  such  as  access,  portability,  and  erasure  create  a  conducive  ecosystem  for  the  development  of  data  
trusts. The court’s jurisdiction to oversee the actions of trustees provides beneficiaries with strong safeguards 
to ensure accountability.  
9. Kenya 
 
 
a)   Data protection and Data rights 
Kenya’s  framing  of  data  protection  and  the  rights  of  data  subjects  are  relatively  latent.  Regulation  of  
information  processing  is  primarily  governed  by  the  Data  Protection  Act  2019,  which  was  enacted  to  
recognise the right to privacy guaranteed under the recently redrafted Constitution of Kenya.
289
  
Among  other  rights,  the  Data  Protection  Act  confers  data  subjects  with  the  rights  to  access,  request  
information on their data processing, correction, and portability. The law also imposes restrictions on the flow 
of personal data outside its borders.  Data can only be transferred across borders if there is adequate data 
protection safeguards or consent from the data subject. 
b) Data Sharing  
                                                      
289 Article 31(c) and (d)  

87 
 
Owing  to  infrastructural  barriers  and  legislative  gaps,  purpose  or  sector  specific  data  sharing  practices  in  
Kenya are not prevalent. In the public sector, the Kenyan government In 2011, launched the Kenya Open 
Data  Initiative  (KODI),  as  part  of  its  commitment  - under  the-then  newly  codified  constitution  - to  provide  
citizens  with  access  to  information.
290
  Since  its  inception,  KODI  has  made  over  800+  datasets  relating  to  
government sectors such as health, education and infrastructure publicly available.
291
  
c)   Fi
duciary obligations 
Given  Kenya’s  common  law  origins,  the  legal  system  recognises  the  operation  of  trusts.  The  Trustees  
(Perpetual Succession Act specifies the rules regarding the incorporation of trusts for religious, educational, 
literary, scientific, social, athletic, or charitable purposes are defined in the Trustees (Perpetual Succession) 
Act.  
Equally,  fiduciary-like  duties,  such  as  exercising  care  and  skill  and  avoiding  conflicts  of  interest,  are  also  
recognised  in  agency  relationships and corporate frameworks. (directors duties).
292
    For  instance,  section  
145 of the Companies Act 2015 codifies the duty of care, skill, and diligence owed by a director. Similarly, 
section 146 of the Act requires directors to avoid situations that can lead to conflicts of interest. However, 
directors owe these duties to the company and not the shareholders. Courts can intervene to remove/appoint 
new trustees or hold directors liable for breach of fiduciary duty. 
Key takeaways  
Although Kenya's recently enacted data protection law recognises individuals' rights to access, correct, and 
port their data, weak digital infrastructures and regulatory capacity have stultified discourse at an ecosystem 
level on the potential to steward data.  Naturally, restrictions on access and availability of data have a bearing 
on data trusts and other data stewardship models to represent the interests of beneficiaries. In recent times, 
civil society organisations, such as the Open Institute, have been focusing their efforts on creating awareness 
and building networks to communicate the data rights afforded to individuals. 
In  addition  to  the  considerations  on  the  representation  of  data  rights  within  trust  structures,  it  is  equally  
important  to  investigate  the  general  acceptance  of  trusts  within  the  jurisdiction’s  legal  culture.  Like  South  
Africa,  Kenya  has  a  perceptible  reliance  on  corporate  frameworks  like  companies  and  agencies  and  is  
reflected in the manner in which company law has evolved in Kenya.

10. Brazil  
 
a)   Data protection and Data rights  
Although  Brazil  has  various  sectoral  privacy  laws  in  place,  the  enactment  of  the  General  Personal  Data  
Protection Law (LGPD) was Brazil’s first attempt at a comprehensive GDPR-like regulation of personal data. 
The  LGPD  derives  heavily  from  the  principles  defined  in  the  GDPR,  especially  with  regard  to  the  scope,  
territorial application and obligations under the law. Like with GDPR, anonymised data falls outside the ambit 
of regulation.  
The legislation grants rights such as access to data, rectification, portability, opposition to treatment, right to 
information and explanation about the use of data. Interestingly, Article 40 of the LGPD gives the national 
data protection authority powers to prescribe standards for interoperability for portability. This may allow  
b) Data Sharing  
Brazil was one of the founding members of the Open Government Partnership 2011, which sought to promote 
transparency and availability of resources through the use of Information and Communication Technology.
293
 
The  technical  standards  and  standardisation  of  formats  are  overseen  by  the  National  Open  Data  
Infrastructure.
294
 However, purpose led data sharing in Brazil is still latent, with limited policy articulation of 
interoperability standards.

In the financial sector, the Brazilian Central Bank is in the process of increasing the flow of data in the banking 
sector  through  application  programming  interfaces  (APIs)  that  will  give  third-party  developers  access  to  
consumer transaction data to build applications and services around the participating financial institutions.
295
 
c)   Fi
duciary obligations 
As a civil legal system, Brazilian law does not recognise trusts. While the conception of fiduciary law is largely 
absent,  duties  like  care  and  diligence  are  imposed  on  directors -   which  they  owe  towards  the  company  - 
through the Brazilian Corporation Law.
296
  There are other legal entities like foundations and associations 
that allow the collective administration of assets for charitable purposes. Associations can be formed by two 
or more persons for non-profit purposes. An association’s Articles of Organization describe its purpose,  rules 
around the admission and dismissal of the association members, and manner in which board/management 
functions.  
W
hile associations can be  constituted  for  any  purpose,  foundations  are  required  to  have  a  public  interest  
element. Like charities, foundations could be public or private, and are created for specific purposes of public 
interest  by  way  of  an  endowment.
297
  The  Brazilian  Civil  Code  lists  different  areas  for  which  they  can  be  
established. For private foundations, accountability is maintained through oversight powers of the Attorney 
General's  Office.
298
  Public  foundations  are  created  by  the  government  through  legislation  to  undertake  
activities  that  do  not  ordinarily  fall  within  the  government’s  remit.  However,  in  both  these  structures,  it  is  
unclear how data (or the rights over it) could be managed and if fiduciary-like obligations exist within it. Both 
foundations and associations require members to forgo proprietary interests over the assets (data/data rights 
in the case of data trusts). 
 
Key takeaways 
Brazil’s enactment of the LGPD in 2018 culminated in a decade-long movement involving participation from 
academia, civil society, and the private sector.
299
 Like GDPR, the Brazilian law recognises rights such as 
access,  portability,  and  deletion,  which  are  necessary  for  data  intermediaries  to  manage  the  interests  of  
individuals.  
H
owever, like most jurisdictions that have recently enacted a data protection law, the limited discourse at a 
grassroots  level  on  the  rights  available  to  individuals  over  their  personal  data  has  meant  that  regulators'  
efforts  have  been  concentrated  on  creating  awareness  and  ensuring  compliance  with  the  law.
300
  For 
instance,  in  a  survey  conducted  in  September  2020  by  a  Brazilian  credit  intelligence  company,  70%  of  
respondents were unaware of the LGPD.
301
  
Developing a data governance approach that relies on the trust framework in the absence of common law 
trust-like structures  will  prove  challenging.  Conceptualising  data  trusts  require  legislative  intervention  that  
allows for collectivised representation and management of rights over data with avenues to hold trustees or 
managers accountable.

11. Ghana 
 
a)   Data Protection and Data Rights 
In Ghana, data protection is primarily governed through the Data Protection Act, 2012.
302
 In addition to this, 
there  are  other  laws  such  as  the  Electronic  Communications  Act,  2008,  Electronic  Communications  
Regulations,  2011  and  the  Credit  Reporting  Act,  2007  which  have  provisions  on  the  use  of  data.  In  
comparison  to  other  countries,  Ghana’s  Data  Protection  Act  is  comparatively  narrow  in  its  scope.  Data  
subjects have the right to access and correct their personal data, and object to processing of their personal 
data.  While  there  are  no  data  localisation  laws  in  place,  Ghana’s  data  protection  laws  mandate  data  
controllers and processors in Ghana to apply foreign countries’ data protection laws when processing foreign 
citizens’ personal data.  
b) D
ata sharing frameworks  
While Ghana sees an absence of policy and legislative articulation on data sharing, there are some instances 
of public-private sector collaboration for data sharing. For instance, in 2018, Ghana Statistical Service (GSS), 
Vodafone  Ghana,  and  Flowminder  signed  a  data  sharing  agreement  to  formulate  public  health  and  
sustainable  development  policies  by  drawing  insights  from  mobile  phone  data.
303
  Pseudonymised  and  
aggregated data was shared with GSS with limitations on use. The collaboration has continued during the 
pandemic to assess the effectiveness of COVID-19 restrictions by providing insights upon internal migration, 
aggregated  mobility  patterns  and  reductions  in  movement  during  the  pandemic
304
.  With  the  public  sector  
facing  constraints  in  the  availability  of  good  datasets,  such  collaborations  with  private  technology  
corporations allow decision makers access to data that can be leveraged to create targeted policies.

91 
 
c)   Fiduciary obligations 
In  Ghana,  fiduciary  obligations  and  relationships  are  most  clearly  located  in  duties  owed  by  directors  of  
companies. The recently enacted Companies Act, 2019 holds that directors stand in a fiduciary relationship 
towards the company. Directors must act in the best interests of the company, and promote the purposes of 
the company with good faith, diligence and care.
305
  
Such a model for data trusts would require creating a corporate structure where the company has contractual 
arrangements with each data provider, who act in their capacity as shareholders of the company. The data 
transferred to the company would be managed by the directors bound by duties recognised in the Companies 
Act.
306
 Under the Companies Act, shareholders have the power to bring derivative action against the director 
for any breach of breach of fiduciary responsibilities.
307
 
Key takeaways 
The recognition of rights in Ghana’s data protection law and the established administrative and legal recourse 
mechanisms  against  data  controllers  make  the  country’s  data  protection  and  data  rights  ambit  more  
optimistic. Further, interactions with experts reflected a strong political will to realise the value of data, as well 
as a great degree of cooperation between policymakers, regulators and the private sector. However, lack of 
lucid data standardisation policies, combined with a dearth of sectoral data sharing without clear purpose do 
not fare well for Ghana’s data sharing frameworks. In building Ghanian data regimes, a lack of capital has 
also hampered on-ground advocacy and implementation of such rights. The adoption and reliance on trusts 
to  administer  assets  are  unclear.  On  the  contrary,  the  Companies  Act  imposes  fiduciary  duties  on  the  
directors of the company. However, these duties are owed towards the company and not the shareholders.

SECTION 4 
The final section presents the takeaways and insights from our comparative analysis of the 
jurisdictions, identifying the various challenges and uncertainties in the current ecosystem 
to develop data trusts. The latter part of the section also outlines areas that are not within 
the  report's  scope  but  merit  further  research  and  exploration.  Important  takeaways  and  
insights from the section include: 
●   The  articulation  of  data  rights  and  data  sharing  frameworks  varied  significantly  
across different jurisdictions. This was due to a range of factors such as economic 
and political constraints, lack of political will, and disparity in digital infrastructures. 
●   While  certain  jurisdictions  like  the  EU,  UK,  and  Brazil  had  robust  recognition  of  
personal  data  rights,  many  of  them  lacked  the  range  of  rights  - such  as  access,  
portability, and erasure -  required for the operation of data trusts. Even in jurisdictions 
that did recognise them, there were limitations to its exercise.  
●   Through expert interviews, it was observed that even in jurisdictions where there was 
legislative recognition of rights and concepts, the ground reality was quite different. 
So,  while  certain  jurisdictions  recognise  trusts  and  have  enacted  comprehensive  
data protection laws, the actual adoption and implementation might vary significantly. 
4.1 Insights and recommendations from comparative analysis 
 
 
Our  analysis  throws  up  several  key  insights  that  demonstrate  disparity  in  maturity  of  legal  landscapes  for  
data  trusts  around  the  globe,  and  point  to  the  need  for  administrative  and  legislative  investments  in  data  

93 
 
governance  in  several  countries.  Further,  it  was  found  that  for  legal  systems  which  don’t  embed  fiduciary  
duties matching common law structures, there may be a need to explore diverse structures of human-centric 
data governance. 
Disparity across nations and the lack of digital infrastructure 
Given the diversity -  both economic and political -  of the jurisdictions analysed we found that the maturity in 
articulating  rights  over  data  varied significantly.  This  was  partly  due  to  varied  priorities  for  different  
jurisdictions, economic and political constraints, or the lack of political will to articulate these rights. When 
evaluating   data-sharing   policies,   it   is   clear   that   the   robustness   of   digital   and   technical   pathways   
infrastructures plays a vital part. This includes regulatory measures like standardisation of data formats or 
sharing  purpose,  enabling  interoperability,  or  introducing  digital  public  infrastructure.  For  developing  
countries, the absence of data sharing policies is often a function of digitisation capacity. Many countries rely 
on international technology companies to set up this infrastructure, which often comes with restrictions on 
how governments can share or use this generated data. 
Thus, the legal analysis must be read in cognisance of the fact  that developed countries such as those in 
the European Union have, over the years, been able to take  advantage of their economic wealth and social 
awareness  to  prioritise  sturdy  digital  infrastructures.  Therefore,  the  discourse  and  ecosystem  around  
regulation of technologies, data protection and data rights is much more robust and it is unsurprising that a 
progressive and foundational regulation such as the GDPR has emerged out of the EU. Similarly, countries 
such as Australia, Canada, Singapore are also making advances on data protection.  
In  most  of  the  developing  world,  digital  ecosystems  are  defined  by  infrastructure  created  by  western  
technology corporations. While this influence has enabled these jurisdictions to streamline governance and 
improve  access  to  digitised  financial  services,  they  are  prevented  from  deriving  full  value  from  the  data  
generated. Countries like Kenya, India, and South Africa have started responding to some of these concerns 
by framing data localisation laws and policies, applying the lens of ‘data sovereignty’. However, this demands 
durable,  low-friction  digital  infrastructure  that  can  responsibly  collect  and  process  large  amounts  of  data.  
Given  these  tensions,  it  is  often  quite  difficult  for  governments  to  strike  a  balance  between  regulation,  
protectionism and liberalization.    
Personal data rights and building for autonomy 
Even within some of the countries with more robust digital infrastructures, the absence  of certain personal 
data rights -  such as access, portability and erasure -  pose challenges in creating a sustainable data trust 
ecosystem. For instance, Canada, Australia, and South Korea, while faring well on digital infrastructure, have 
yet to recognise clear data portability rights. It was found that in order to enable data trusts in a streamlined 
ecosystem -   infrastructure  alone  cannot  carry  the  torch,  and  personal  data  rights  must  mature  to  enable  
greater  individual  autonomy.  This  also  entails  exploration  of  novel  ways  in  which  individuals  can  exercise  
their rights over data which, in turn, may allow means for collective governance (for example, with the ability 
to pool data). 
On  the  other  hand,  while  some  developing  countries  fared  better  in  recognising  these  rights,  through  
conversations with multiple experts (which have helped contextualise this work) it was found that there is 
often  a  dissonance  between  the  provisions  of  legislation  and  its  actual  enforcement.  For  instance,  in  a  
November 2020 survey conducted by the Brazilian Association of Software Companies (ABES) and EY, it 
was  observed  that  nearly  60%  of  the  corporations  in  the  technology  sector  were  yet  to  comply  with  the  
provisions of the LGPD. Thus, for most of these nations, there is a need to not only enable a fertile legal 
landscape for data trusts, but to build capacity, awareness and process-oriented enforcement. 
In order to map individual data rights to the trust structure, a certain level of mandatability or transference of 
rights is necessitated. In order for a trustee to manage a subject's data, there must be clear legal outlines as 
to what level of an individual's autonomy over their data can come within the ambit of third party delegation. 
Consequently,  the  aim  of  fiduciary  relationships  is  partly  to  protect  beneficiaries  and  guard  against  the  
resultant power dynamic between beneficiary and trustee. However, such a transference - which enables 
trustees to exercise data rights on behalf of the beneficiary -  is an incredibly delicate and contentious legal 
space, and there is a need to guard against paternalistic structures that delegation of data rights may enable. 

94 
 
Legislative implementation and regulatory oversight  
The marked variance in legislative process and the implementation of laws has been a recurring feature in 
this analysis. Legal concepts that are common across jurisdictions are not always implemented uniformly. 
For instance, the extent of adoption of trusts in Kenya and South Africa -  countries with common law origins 
- is not as crystalised as compared to jurisdictions such as England, which extensively use trusts for a variety 
of commercial and non-commercial purposes. Therefore, the feasibility of trusts remains an underdeveloped 
and underexplored area of law.  
Although charitable  trusts  in  the  UK  and  Australia,  and  business  trusts  in  Singapore  have  established  
regulatory regimes, a common thread across most jurisdictions was the absence of institutionalised oversight 
mechanisms  that  can  regulate  data  trusts.  Regulatory  authorities  can  incorporate  flexible  methods  to  
navigate challenges while giving legitimacy and certainty to the activities of data trusts. Ex-ante and ex-post 
regulatory powers also ensure accountability and are invaluable in jurisdictions where court processes are 
costly. Unlike legislative approaches, which are typically binding and slow to change, regulators can adopt 
more participatory practices that reflect the concerns of stakeholders from the private sector, academia, and 
civil society.  
The  success of  the  regulator  will  depend  on  how  it  contextualises  its  approach.  Considering  the  nascent  
stage at which data trusts are in practice, regulators must play a much more proactive and reflexive role in 
creating awareness, engaging different stakeholders in the ecosystem, and guarding against regulatory and 
ecosystem capture. However, any such approach will require investments in building regulatory capacity.  
A ‘data trust conundrum’ for stewardship 
It is evident that the conception of data trusts is most fundamentally rooted in English trust law. Based on 
this analysis, even in jurisdictions that have common law influence and recognise trusts, the evolution of its 
concepts have not mirrored the English experience. This is even more the case when considering gaps and 
uncertainties  around  the  ability  for  data  rights  to  form  the  subject  matter  of  trusts.  In  some  of  the  
commonwealth jurisdictions, the codification of trusts may have restricted its scope.
308
 
T
he case studies chronicled in Output 1 (Data Trust Survey) showcase a diversity of initiatives that empower 
communities and individuals to steward data. These case studies highlight the bottom-up approach and show 
differences in structures such as MIDATA and Driver’s Seat are data co-operatives; they focus on community 
empowerment and managing data use with data generators participation. Further, Output 1 also presents a 
result  of  a  survey  targeting  practitioners  who  are  building  trusts  and  how  these  initiatives  have  identified  
themselves  and  their  approach.  The survey  lays  down  6  functions  of  data  trusts  as  per  GPAI  definition.  
Respondents who performed all 6 functions were either not active or preferred not to be called data trusts. 
Legal barriers such as clarity on data rights of citizens,variation of data rights across different jurisdictions or  
even  having  an  operative  data  protection  legislation  in  the  first  place,  and  the  ambiguity  in  recognition  of  
trusts and whether trusts can hold data (or rights over it) could be the reason why initiatives fail to meet the 
conception of data trusts. 
Given this, our analysis has attempted to locate functionally equivalent provisions in these jurisdictions. By 
identifying, for instance, fiduciary-like duties and the scope for similar judicial interventions that are contained 
in trust structures. Yet this application has not been a straightforward exercise. For instance, while civil legal 
systems such as Germany recognise higher standards of care and good faith in contractual obligations when 
compared with common law systems, it is still not feasible to draw parallels with the fiduciary relationship 
between  a  trustee  and  beneficiary  where  the  scope  of  remedies  available  are  very  different.  These  
complexities have raised a keen awareness that the trust structure may not be one that can be resurrected 
in a uniform manner across most legal systems.  
However, as we work toward the goal of enabling value oriented, human-centric data governance, there is 
promise in a number of jurisdictions (based on their performance across the key legal enablers) to develop 
trust-like  structures  and  alternate  models  of  data  stewardship.  In  regions  like  Singapore,  Canada,  South  
Korea or Germany, for example, there is favourable alignment across the analysis framework and while it 
may  be  arduous  to  build  data  trusts  in  particular,  there  is  certainly  potential  to  broaden  the  horizon  of

stewardship  to  models  like  data  cooperatives,  data  exchanges,  collaboratives  or  others.  It  is  important  to  
guard against a pigeonhole of stewardship that foregrounds data trusts even in regions where other modes 
of  governance  can  minimise  legislative  overhaul  and  friction,  while  still  working  to  maximise  participation,  
agency and value.  
Thus,  it  is  critical  to  note  that  the  analysis  reflects  legal  fertility  for  only  data  trusts  as  defined  in  
aforementioned sections
309
, and the outcomes or levels depicted must not be confused to be a decree on 
the overall robustness of a region's data regime. Many of the jurisdictions captured are better suited to other 
models of data stewardship, and there is a need to amplify discourse, tests and enable human centric data 
governance in ways that play to the strengths of various legal systems. And for many, these strengths are 
not most ideally captured by trust law. 
4.2 Scope of the research -  open questions  
While  this  analysis  has  encompassed  the  legal  necessities,  status  and  challenges  in  implementing  data  
trusts, there are a number of limitations that feature beyond the scope of this review, and are yet pertinent in 
the exploration of data trusts and other human centric forms of data governance.  
While the framing of personal data rights has individuals at its focal point, an area that merits exploration is 
the consequence of collectivising these rights under trusts. A critical question that needs to be addressed is 
how regulations propose to balance collective interests and individuals' interests. Equally, what avenues for 
recourse  will  aggrieved  minority  groups  in  a  data  trust  have,  and  how  can  personal  data  rights  be  
disaggregated from the collectivised rights and interests? 
Intellectual  property  rights  (IPR)  claims  over  data  held  by  organisations  can  also  create  barriers  to  the  
portability of data to data trusts, specifically in the case of inferred data, which is not provided by the data 
generator. While the tensions between IPR and data protection laws currently curtail individuals’ right to port 
inferred  data,  the  possibility  of  collective  data  rights  -   as  articulated  in  India  for  non-personal  data  - over 
aggregated data and the role of data trusts to negotiate these tensions needs to be evaluated.  
Discussions in Europe -  under the proposed Data Act -  and the U.S. on the framing of co-generated rights 
also pose new questions on the possibility of data trusts to hold co-generated data.
310
 The feasibility for data 
trusts to hold these data rights will depend on how co-generated rights are framed, and extent to which data 
generators are granted rights over, for instance, the portability rights afforded to them.  
A
t a foundational level, trusts offer an institutional framework for data trusts to operate. The nature of a trust's 
functions will depend on its governance structure and the interests that individual data trusts wish to achieve. 
Building  a  plurality  of  data  trusts  that  pursue  diverse  interests,  among  other  factors,  depends  on  the  
articulation of revenue models.  It is vital to explore incentivisation structures that can foster trustees to pursue 
their beneficiaries' interests proactively.
