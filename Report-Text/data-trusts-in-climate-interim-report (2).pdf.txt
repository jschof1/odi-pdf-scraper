Executive Summary  
According to the World Meteorological Organization, 2019 concluded a decade of exceptional global heat, 
retreating ice and record sea levels driven by greenhouse gases produced by human activities.

Data and artificial intelligence have a vital role to play in helping us understand and tackle this climate 
crisis, from predicting extreme weather events, to improving the energy efficiency of our homes and helping 
to identify deforestation.  
However, as with data systems at large, individuals and communities tend to have little say in how data is 
collected, used and shared for climate action. Data trusts and other forms of ‘bottom-up’ data stewardship 
have emerged to reverse this trend and empower people to take part in the data economy. 
This  report  sets  out  the  work  undertaken  for  the  project  ‘Data  trusts  in  climate’,  completed  between  
November  2021  and  March  2022.  The  project  was  commissioned  by  the  Global  Partnership  on  Artificial  
Intelligence  (GPAI)  and  delivered  in  partnership  by  the  Open  Data  Institute  (ODI)  and  Aapti  Institute,  with  
support from the Data Trusts Initiative. It consisted of a literature review, expert interviews and a co-design 
process involving more than 50 organisations from around the world. 
We articulate a design for a London Cycling Data Trust, describing how it could interact with the cycling 
community, be legally incorporated, the technologies it could use and its options for funding. We found that 
data trusts will be less feasible in other contexts and difficult to apply for a variety of reasons, including ones 
of cultural, technological and economic nature. We set out lessons learned from exploring data trusts for small 
shareholder farming in India and for indigenous climate migration in Peru. 
This work has produced a set of generic feasibility criteria for data trusts, which are intended for use by 
policymakers and practitioners seeking to understand where data trusts may be necessary and possible, in 
climate change and beyond. It also sets out a practical roadmap for the development of a London Cycling 
Data Trust and other similar data trusts, outlining the steps required to implement it in the real world. 
We also discuss other approaches to responsible data stewardship for AI, and options for GPAI and other 
policymakers interested in this agenda. 
As  in  all  progress  around  new  approaches  to  data  stewardship,  it  is  essential  to  test  these  ideas  further.   
This project is another step forward for data trusts, but much more is required to unlock their potential.

Enabling Data Sharing for Social Benefit Through Data Trusts: Data Trusts in Climate

1. Introduction 
The objective of this project was to assess the opportunity to create data trusts that would facilitate action to 
tackle climate change and, if feasible, produce a roadmap for the development of a real-world data trust in a 
vital climate domain. It is the latest in the GPAI’s efforts to enable data sharing for social benefit through data 
trusts, and builds on previous work
2
 undertaken by the ODI, Aapti Institute and Data Trusts Initiative to explore 
their potential. 
We  set  out  to  help  bridge  the  gap  between  the theory  and  practice  of  data  trusts.  What  could  data  trusts   
look  like  in  the  wild  and  how  would  they  interact  with  different  communities  to  address  pressing  climate   
issues? What are the key barriers and frictions that would need to be overcome to develop them? This report 
shares our findings. 
In Section 2, we provide a backdrop, discussing the role of data and artificial intelligence in understanding 
and  tackling  climate  change.  We  contextualise  data  trusts  as  a  promising  approach  to  ‘bottom-up’  data 
stewardship, where individuals and communities are empowered to control how data about them is collected, 
used and shared, and provide a summary of the latest discourse on the concept.  
Drawing  from  the  core  functions  of  the  approach  identified  by  GPAI’s  Data  Governance  Working  Group  in  
2021, we document the criteria developed and used to assess the feasibility of data trusts in Section 3. Given 
data  trusts  exist  as  a  mode  of  stewardship  designed  to  empower  communities  around  data,  these   
feasibility criteria are anchored around a community’s readiness and ability to engage. We intend for others 
to use this as a general framework to understand where data trusts may be useful in the near-term, in climate 
change and beyond. 
Designing  data  stewardship  arrangements  is  contextual,  dependent  on  different  and  specific  dynamics,   
issues  and  needs.  In  Section  4,  we  document  the  results  of  our  work  to  design  and  assess  the  feasibility   
of applying data trusts to three different climate domains: city sustainability, small shareholder farming and 
climate  migration.  This  work  followed  a  process  of  co-design,  whereby  experts  in  these  domains  and  data   
stewardship  came  together  to  explore  what  data  trusts  could  look  like,  using  collaborative  design  frame- 
works and methodologies.  
Based on our positive assessment of its feasibility, we build out a roadmap for the development of the London 
Cycling Data Trust – also applicable to other locales – in Section 5. The roadmap includes steps covering the 
essential elements of community, capacity, legal and governance, technology, and scale and sustainability. 
Like any roadmap, the reality of building the data trust will be messier, more difficult and less linear than we 
set  out,  but  we  hope  it  describes  to  GPAI  and  other  stakeholders  the  nature  of  the  interventions  required   
on their behalf. 
In Section 6, we share broader conclusions from this work, including on the feasibility and next steps for the 
three climate domains, the process of co-design and the general feasibility of data trusts. We also discuss 
other  approaches  to  responsible  data  stewardship  for  AI,  and  options  for  GPAI  and  other  policymakers  
interested in data stewardship.  
More  information  about  this  research,  along  with  the  methodology  used  and  a  bibliography,  can  be  found  
as appendices.

2. Climate Change, Artificial Intelligence and Data Trusts 
2.1 The Role of Data in Understanding and Tackling Climate Change 
In  1856,  Eunice  Foote  determined  that  increasing  concentrations  of  ‘carbonic  acid  gas’  in  the  atmosphere  
would lead to a global warming of the climate. Working under the constraints of her time, Foote collected data 
to compare the temperature of exhausted and condensed air under differing exposures to the sun's rays to 
demonstrate how an atmosphere with higher carbonic acid gas would warm the earth
3
. 
In  the  time  between  Foote’s  experiments  and  the  writing  of  this  report,  human  activities  have  raised  
atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide by almost 49%
4
. Scientists predict that this trend will lead to a 
continued warming of the planet and many significant effects, some of which are already occurring. These 
include more droughts and heat waves, stronger hurricanes and tropical storms, rising sea levels and loss of 
arctic  sea  ice.  The  Intergovernmental  Panel  on  Climate  Change  (IPCC)  has  recently  described  how  these  
changes  will  directly  impact  human  life,  highlighting  increased  climate  migration,  food  and  agricultural  
insecurity, water scarcity and disease transmission
5
. 
Just as Foote demonstrated more than 160 years ago, data has a vital role to play in helping us understand 
and tackle these impacts to our planet and humanity. GPAI’s Responsible AI Working Group describes how 
significant advancements in the field of artificial intelligence – ‘any computer algorithm that makes predictions, 
recommendations or decisions on the basis of a defined set of objectives’
6
 – have made yet more possible 
with data.
7
 GPAI’s Responsible AI Working Group identifies four ways
8
   in which data and AI are being used 
to support climate understanding and action: 
• distilling raw data into actionable information. For example, the UK’s Office for National 
Statistics (ONS) generates insights from large transportation datasets to inform the development 
of pedestrian-friendly infrastructure, improved public transport measures and a transition to ultra-
low emissions vehicles.
9
  
• optimising complex systems. For example, ThermaFY is applying artificial intelligence to identify 
energy inefficiencies in buildings’ heating and cooling systems, helping to reduce their 
emissions.

• accelerating scientific modelling and discovery. For example, in Brazil, Imazon is using 
artificial intelligence to identify deforestation zones in the Amazon, and assist government 
agencies in protecting and conserving the rainforest.
11
 
• improving predictions. Many governments around the world are using data to better predict and 
prepare for extreme weather events, including periods of drought, extreme cold or heat, hurricanes 
and cyclones.
12,13
 
However, despite the positive advancements of data and AI in this field and the wider data economy, one can 
observe two inter-related phenomena: ‘data hoarding’ and ‘data fearing’
14
. 
‘Data hoarding’ relates to a scenario where organisations restrict access to data due to misperceptions about 
its value or the risks associated with data sharing. The benefits of data collection and use are only enjoyed by 
a  few,  while  the  negative  impacts  of  its  use  affect  society  as  a  whole.
15
  In  their  report  on  the  digital  
commonwealth,  Mathew  Lawrence  and  Laurie  Laybourn-Langton  argue  that  the  power  of  data  and  AI  is  
concentrated in the hands of the few in the current digital economy, and that ‘without action, the boundless 
ambition of the universal platforms threatens to undermine democracy, accelerate inequality and concentrate 
economic power’
16
. 
The scenario of ‘data fearing’ describes how data might not be collected or used to the extent it could, due  
to  concerns  about  the  harm  that  it  can  cause  people  being  left  unaddressed.
17
  People  might  avoid  using  
services, or withdraw consent for data to be collected, which means that we end up missing data and the uses 
of  it  that  could  support  human  flourishing.  In  the  report  ‘Digital  technology  and  the  planet:  harnessing  
computing to achieve net zero’
18
, the Royal Society set out how new technologies could be used to address 
the challenges to privacy and security that deploying AI to the climate crisis can encounter. It also outlined the 
need to ensure that the positive impacts generated from data use in this context are felt by those who have 
originated the data. 
These phenomena have problematic consequences in terms of making use of data and AI in the battle against 
climate change. For example, a lack of accessibility to proprietary mobility data sets – driven by organisations 
hoarding data they hold – has impacted our ability to adequately track carbon emissions.
19
 Elsewhere, smart 
meter users have withdrawn consent for data to be shared, due to concerns that it would be used to identify

their personal routines, sold to other companies or help ‘hackers’ access the data
20
. While data and AI alone 
will not solve the climate crisis, improving access to data could help provide valuable insights to policymakers, 
communities and organisations in the efforts to respond to it. 
2.2 The Emergence of Bottom-Up Data Stewardship 
The  concept  of  data  stewardship  is  a  response  to  these  ‘data  hoarding’  and  ‘data  fearing’  scenarios.  Data  
stewardship can be understood as an approach to data governance that aims to unlock the societal value of 
data,  while  responsible  and  rights-preserving  in  nature.
21
  More  specifically,  the  idea  of  ‘bottom-up  data  
stewardship’ is a tonic to the typical exclusion of individuals and communities from data collection, use and 
sharing.
22
  Bottom-up  data  stewardship  recognises  individuals  and  communities  as  more  than  recipients  of  
information – or mere providers of consent – about how data about them is used,
23
 and seeks to empower 
them to participate in the process of data collection, use and sharing. 
An ecosystem of research and practice has emerged around this concept of ‘bottom-up data stewardship’. 
The MyData Global community, for example, is set out ‘to empower individuals by improving their right to self-
determination regarding their personal data’.
24
 The Mozilla Data Futures Lab was launched in 2021 to support 
experimentation  around  ‘new  approaches  to  data  stewardship  that  give  greater  control  and  agency  to  
people’.
25
 The Ada Lovelace Institute advocates for ‘participatory data stewardship’, where people whose data 
is  used,  or  about  which  data  decisions  are  taken,  are  meaningfully  involved.
26
  Aapti  Institute’s  work  at  the  
Data Economy Lab
27
 aims to empower individuals and communities to play a bigger part in data governance, 
and it has documented numerous examples of this in practice.
28
 The Data Trusts Initiative is supporting pilot 
projects that create bottom-up data stewardship mechanisms to serve their communities.
29
 
A number of promising data stewardship initiatives have emerged to enable groups to generate or repurpose 
data about them, and exert collective control over it for a common purpose. For instance: 
• Variant Bio
30
 works with historically marginalised populations to facilitate people-driven 
therapeutics, where communities are engaged prior to the beginning of research projects  
and their data is collected and used within a framework that focalises community concerns.

• Driver’s Seat
31
 is an independent, driver-owned cooperative where members’ data is used  
to derive insights that help them optimise their performance. 
• OpenHumans
32
 empowers individuals and communities to explore and share their personal data 
for the purposes of education, health and research. 
Bottom-up  approaches  to  data  stewardship  are  already  being  used  to  tackle  the  climate  crisis.
33
  They  are  
often  framed  as  ‘citizen  science’,  whereby  individuals  contribute  data  through  observations  or  sensors,   
such as: 
• iNaturalist
34
 is a citizen science project which empowers people to document biodiversity  
and share images of flora and fauna as they come across it in nature. 
• Globe at Night
35
 is an international citizen-science campaign to raise public awareness of the 
impact of light pollution by inviting citizen-scientists to measure and share their observations of the 
brightness of the night sky. 
• Sensor.Community
36
 is    a network of individuals with DIY air quality sensors. The community 
pools data about air quality from all over the world to create an open environmental dataset. 
These  examples  of  data  stewardship,  focused  on  empowering  individuals  to  exert  more  control  over  data,  
offer inspiration for the role that data trusts could play in tackling the climate crisis. However, despite their vast 
potential, there are few examples and most initiatives of this type are limited in scale and focus on citizen-
science – there remains significant work to explore further climate contexts where they can be applied. 
2.3 Data Trusts 
The concept of ‘data trusts’ can be seen against this backdrop of bottom-up data stewardship. Although there 
have been varying interpretations of the term
37
, the idea of extracting value from data and restructuring its 
distribution through the use of data trusts was posited by Professor Neil Lawrence in 2016,
38
 who noted data 
trusts could act as ‘power brokers’ to mediate the use of data for public benefit, without compromising the 
rights of the data subjects to whom the data relates.

Subsequently, Professor Sylvie Delacroix and Lawrence articulated ‘bottom-up data trusts’ in 2019
39
 as a tool 
of collective engagement used by communities to decide on how their data is used and shared by third parties. 
They described how trustees could be bound by fiduciary obligations of undivided loyalty and care towards its 
beneficiaries,  defining  the  terms  for  purpose-led  data  sharing.  The  Data  Trusts  Initiative  builds  on  this  
conception of data trusts
40
. It describes them as a ‘mechanism for individuals to pool their data rights into an 
organisation’
41
 to rebalance the respective control that corporations and individuals have over personal data, 
and provide a legal mechanism to empower data subjects to choose to appoint others to make those decisions 
on their behalf. 
Similarly, Aapti’s interpretation of a data trust refers to ‘a legal arrangement wherein a person authorises an 
individual or entity to manage certain property for the benefit of a third party or for certain defined purposes’.
42
 
In the context of the data economy, the data (or rights over it) constitutes the property
43
 that will be managed 
by the trust and the trustee (an authorised representative individual or entity) is bound by fiduciary obligations 
to act in the best interests of its beneficiaries and according to the defined purposes.  
GPAI’s  Data  Governance  Working  Group  is  advancing  the  understanding  and  application  of  data  trusts,   
based on their potential to ‘expand access to data for innovation while putting citizen interests at the heart  
of stewardship’.
44
 
Functionally speaking, GPAI’s Data Governance Working Group has described  
that data trusts:
45
 
1.   provide a platform for collectives to establish desirable terms and conditions

In February 2022, GPAI’s Data Governance Working Group published the report ‘Enabling data sharing for 
social benefit through data trusts’,
46
 documenting the findings of research conducted by Aapti Institute and 
the ODI into global knowledge, attitudes and practices of data trusts. The research found general optimism 
about the potential of data trusts (particularly in Europe and North America). However, despite encountering 
several other real-world bottom-up data stewardship initiatives, it found no examples of data trusts that were 
able to deliver all of the functions listed above. While existing initiatives do provide platforms for communities 
to pool data and place safeguards and oversight mechanisms around its use, the role of trustees in enabling 
data stewardship remains a difficult function to operationalise.
47
 In parallel, Aapti Institute was commissioned 
by  GPAI  to  examine  the  existing  and  necessary  legal  mechanisms  required  to  develop  data  trusts.
48
  This 
analysis found a disparity in the maturity of legal landscapes for data trusts around the globe, and the need to 
explore diverse legal structures for enabling data trusts and other forms of data stewardship. 
There are a number of domains where data could support the development of AI and where that data could 
be  subject  to  the  control  of  individuals.  Data  trusts  are  worth  investigating  as  providing  a  vehicle  for  
communities to do this around climate issues, under a regime of strong fiduciary protections.

3. Criteria for Assessing the Feasibility of Data Trusts 
This project sought to assess the feasibility of data trusts in the context of pressing climate issues. Through 
this  work,  we  learnt  that  feasibility  is  a  function  of  a  number  of  factors,  many  of  which  relate  to  the  
characteristics  of  the  community  needed  to  create  and  sustain  it.  We  have  structured  these  as  the   
following questions: 
1. Is there an incentive for the community to come together to create a data trust? 
As a mode of bottom-up data stewardship, a group of motivated individuals need to come together around a 
common purpose or cause that can be addressed by a data trust. The incentive could be based on financial 
return, reciprocal value exchange or altruism. 
2. Do members of the community have the capacity to engage in the development  
and running of a data trust? 
As well as coalescing around a cause, a data trust requires individuals to actively participate by delegating 
their data or rights to it. Not all groups of individuals will have the awareness, skills or time to engage and 
participate to this extent, both in the setting up of a data trust and in the running of it. 
3. Is there a person, group or organisation who can credibly drive the development  
of a data trust with the community? 
In the spirit of bottom-up/participatory data stewardship, the process of building a data trust should be led by 
someone  from  or  with  a  strong  connection  to  the  community.  They  may  have  a  role  to  play  in  building  
awareness, educating, upskilling and organising. While organisations like GPAI can seek to provide inspiration 
and even facilitate, contextual expertise, credibility and leadership is important. 
4. Is there demand for the data among prospective users, with clearly bound use cases for it? 
More data isn’t always better
49
. If the purpose of a data trust is to enable access to data – and importantly, to 
safeguard the rights of, and distribute value back to, those contributing it – then the intended data users, use 
cases  and  impacts  of  the  data’s  use  should  be  clearly  articulated.  If  similar  data  is  available  from  other  
sources, then it should also be clear why users would seek to access it via the data trust.  
5. Are there data rights in the jurisdiction that individuals from the community  
could delegate to the data trust? 
A data trust is designed to steward data on behalf of a community. This requires the existence of legal data 
rights  that  individuals  can  delegate  to  a  data  trust  to  execute  on  their  behalf,  as  well  as  the  right  to  data  
portability,  which  may  be  needed  to  repurpose  data  from  existing  sources  as  part  of  the  data  trust’s  
stewardship  activities.  As  previous  research  by  Aapti  Institute  has  shown,  there  is  a  variance  in  access  to  
these rights internationally.
50
  
6. Are there legal instruments in the jurisdiction that could be used to construct  
a data trust and establish fiduciary obligations to the community? 
In contrast to other forms of bottom-up data stewardship, a data trust is designed to hold contextual, specific 
fiduciary duties to the community who have originated the data. To impart them, this requires the existence of 
appropriate legal forms or constructs, such as trusts, charities and other organisational forms.

7. Is it technologically possible for the data trust to exert control over the data  
it would be responsible for? 
While we don’t see an absence of technology as a particular barrier to setting up a data trust, there will be 
varying levels of technological feasibility.
51
 Important factors include whether the data trust actually holds data 
on  behalf  of  the  community,  and  whether  the  data  already  exists  or  needs  to  be  collected  –  and  if  it  does  
already exist, whether there is infrastructure that enables it (or at least access to it) to ‘flow’ to the data trust 
and/or prospective data users. 
8. Is there access to sufficient funding to set up the data trust, and options  
to ensure its continued sustainability? 
Setting  up  and  running  a  data  trust  will  require  funding,  including  to  build  interfaces  with  those  who  will  
contribute data, develop technological systems to securely hold and provide access to it, and recompense 
trustees. Options for funding could include philanthropic donors and other actors aligned with its purpose, or 
charging data users for licences to access data and other services. 
We intend for this feasibility criteria to be useful to others considering whether a data trust – and with some 
adaptation, other forms of bottom-up data stewardship – is suitable in their context.

4. Data Trusts for Climate 
In this section, we document the results of our work to co-design and assess the feasibility of applying data 
trusts within: city sustainability, small shareholder farming and climate migration. The three data trusts were 
co-designed  with  experts  from  across  the  three  domains  –  to  learn  more  about  the  process  behind  the  
selection of these domains and the co-design phase, please see the Methodology appendix of this report.   
4.1 Exploring a Data Trust for Cycling in London 
 
Summary 
• Context: Meeting emissions reduction targets requires a significant move away from motorised 
transport to more active forms of travel. In London, a quarter of carbon emissions come from the 
transport of people and goods, but cycling is on the rise. 
• Key actors: The ecosystem consists of cyclists, Transport for London, the 33 London Boroughs, 
mapping and navigation services, micro mobility providers, and academic institutions. 
• Opportunity: There is demand for more precise data in this domain, as well as desire for 
improved cycling infrastructure among the cycling community and existing models of bottom-up 
civic participation to provide inspiration. 
• Potential data trust: A London Cycle Data Trust could provide London's cycling community  
with a platform to contribute data to affect positive changes to the design of cycling infrastructure 
in their city. 
• Legal form: Under UK GDPR, subjects of personal data are granted eight extended rights, 
which could be delegated to a ‘true’ legal trust or a company limited by guarantee. 
• Governance: Trustees could include experts on city sustainability, digital economy, law, and 
technology, taking on responsibility for granular decisions about who can access the data 
brought together as well as advocating for broader improvements to cycling infrastructure. 
• Technology: A mobile app - Positive Cycle -   could collect GPS data and motion data about  
the cyclists’ movements; given the sensitive nature of the data, a ‘privacy by design’ approach 
should be adopted. 
• Sustainability: Setting up a London Cycle Data Trust could be supported by philanthropic 
funders, with various potential revenue models for self-sustainability.

4.1.1. Introduction to the domain 
Cities are major contributors to climate change - despite accounting for less than 2% of the Earth’s surface, 
cities  consume  78%  of  the  world’s  energy  and  produce  more  than  60%  of  greenhouse  gas  emissions.
52
 
According  to  a  UN  report,  another  2.5  billion  people  will  reside  in  urban  areas  by  2050.
53
  Taken  from  a  
historical  perspective,  cities  in  the  global  north  have  contributed  significantly  more  to  climate  change  than  
those in the global south – according to one study, the global north has contributed around 92% of excess 
global carbon emissions.
54
 
There are a number of areas where cities can mitigate their impact on climate change – from reducing the 
amount of energy and water that is used, to tackling the level of air pollution around the city, to improving the 
ways that its citizens move around the city in a more sustainable way.
55
 Meeting greenhouse gas emissions 
reduction targets requires a significant move away from motorised transport – shifting to active transport could 
save as much as a quarter of personal carbon dioxide emissions from transport.
56
 This makes shifting away 
from  car  usage  in  cities  a  high  impact  opportunity.  In  order  to  encourage  more  people  to  cycle,  there  is  a  
general consensus that if good cycling infrastructure is built, then people will use it. In Spain, Seville’s decision 
to build 80km of cycle lanes in just a few years led to significant behaviour change, and an 11-fold increase 
in rider numbers.
57
 
A quarter of London’s carbon emissions come from the transport of people and goods, with three quarters of 
these  from  road  transport
58
.  While  some  action  has  been  taken  (such  as  the  expansion  of  the  Ultra  Low  
Emissions Zone), there remains more to be done to reduce the number of cars on its roads. As part of this, 
more than 260km of new cycling infrastructure has been built since 2016, increasing the cycle network by a 
factor  of  five.
59
  Combined  with  the  increase  in  physical  exercise  due  to  the  Covid-19  Pandemic,
60
  it  has  
contributed to a huge boost in cycling, with more than 200% increase in cycle flows in the last two weekends 
of February 2021 compared to 2020.

4.1.2. The cycling ecosystem in London 
Cycling is growing in popularity in London and its number of cyclists have more than doubled since 2000.
62
 
According to a recent report, 27% of Londoners already cycle and another 16% are actively considering taking 
up cycling.
63
 During the Covid-19 pandemic, many cities experienced a boom in cycling, as people spent more 
time outside exercising. London was no different, with a 7% increase in cycling in inner London and a 22% 
increase in outer London in 2020 compared to 2019.
64
  
50% of Londoners own or have access to their own bikes,
65
 and this ecosystem is supported by a growing 
network of micro-mobility providers, including Santander Cycles, HumanForest and Lime. 
There is a strong desire from the London Mayor's Office to improve the cycling experience in London. Its 
transport  strategy  states  that  by  2041,  80%  of  journeys  are  to  be  made  by  walking,  cycling  and  public  
transport.
66
 Decisions about the development of cycling infrastructure in London are made by two key groups: 
Transport for London and the 33 London Boroughs. These groups employ an evidence-based approach 
to  planning  and  evaluating  new  cycling  infrastructure,  utilising  an  increasingly  wide  range  of  information  to  
inform their decisions.
67
 
Cyclists use a number of services to get around, including mobile apps such as Google Maps, Komoot and 
CityMapper. On these apps cycling is one of the standard mobility options to choose from, while other services 
– such as Strava – are more directly focused on meeting cyclists' needs.  
Advocacy  groups,  such  as  the  London  Cycling  Campaign,  advocate  on  the  behalf  of  London cyclists  to  
improve  the  safety  of  London's  cycling  ecosystem,
68
  and  have  created  products  like  the  Healthy  Streets  
Scorecard
69
 and the Climate Safe Streets report.

4.1.3. The opportunity to improve how data is stewarded 
Understanding the different ways that people move around the city is important for making decisions about 
infrastructure improvement. TfL utilises data modelling to understand where the best value cycle routes could 
be built, and provide the local boroughs with the funding to build these routes. They take an evidence based 
approach to evaluating the impacts of new infrastructure, utilising survey data, traffic counts and more. TfL’s 
models attempt to predict traffic flows around the city, and to understand the impacts that new infrastructure 
may have on the flow of the city. 
Through the co-design phase, we also learnt that other actors were interested in accessing and using data 
about  cycling  patterns  in  London.  Transport  providers  and  micro  mobility  companies are  seeking  to  
understand  how  people  move  around  the  city  to  best  meet  the  needs  of  their  customers.  Companies  like  
Vivacity Labs are working with the local boroughs to improve transport services by reducing congestion and 
improving  air  quality  using  data  from  cameras  and  sensors,  and  academic  institutions  such  as  the  AI  for  
People and Planet department at UCL are attempting to use data and AI to improve passenger forecasting 
and personalised travel recommendations. 
Cycling data tends to originate from manual processes like bike counts, origin-destination polls and surveys 
or directly from service users who have consented to data collection through Google, Strava and telecoms 
providers.  For  example,  Strava’s  Metro  tool  ‘aggregates,  de-identifies  and  contextualises  this  [Strava’s] 
dataset to help make cities better for anyone on foot or on a bike’.
71
 Strava Metro claims to be the largest 
aggregated and de-identified active transportation dataset in the world
72
 and has worked with cities such as 
Oslo and Sydney to better understand mobility flows and to improve their infrastructure.
73
  
However,  multiple  participants  in  the  design  phase  for  this  domain  suggested  that  this  data  is  often  too  
expensive  to  access,  not  granular  enough  or  lacking  representation.
7475
    On  the  latter  point,  they  argued   
that  the  common  user  of  the  Strava  and  similar  ‘niche’  apps  does  not  represent  the  majority  of  London’s  
cycling community, missing everyday Londoners who utilise their bikes for trips to the shops or to drop their 
kids at school. 
According to several of our participants, there is precedent for cyclists coalescing around efforts to improve 
cycling infrastructure. For example, in their use of platforms such as FixMyStreet to report, view, or discuss 
problems  with  local  roads,
76
  and  in  Galway,  Ireland,  using  a  collective  intelligence  tool  to  generate  ideas   
for  improving  the  city’s  mobility  planning
77
.   Despite  this,  and  increases  to  people’s  awareness  of  data  
collection  and  use  that  underpins  technologies  like  these  route  planning  services,
78
  cyclists  currently  have  
limited control over how data about them is collected, used or shared, and opportunities to direct it towards 
causes they support.

4.1.4. The potential of a data trust in this domain 
A London Cycle Data Trust could bring together London's cycling community, and provide them with a platform 
to contribute data to affect positive changes to the design of cycling infrastructure in their city. 
In aggregate and under specified terms, the data brought together by London Cycle Data Trust could be used 
by Transport for London and the 33 London Boroughs to feed into their decision making and the design of 
new  cycling  infrastructure.  Further  context  about  how  different  people  move  around  the  city,  and  for  what  
reasons,  would  feed  directly  into  the  modelling  and  evaluation  models.  Other  organisations  like  London  
Cycling  Campaign  could  use  the  data  to  drive  their  evidence-based  advocacy  work,  and  micro  mobility  
companies could use the data to better position their fleets to support the public. Importantly, some uses would 
be blocked – for example, access may not be granted to companies seeking to target cyclists with advertising 
based on their movements. 
 
Figure 1: a potential London Cycling Data Trust 
  

Enabling Data Sharing for Social Benefit Through Data Trusts: Data Trusts in Climate 
19 
 
Some bottom-up data stewardship initiatives are enabled by groups of individuals being willing to donate data 
towards a good cause.
79
 OpenHumans, for example, enables people to make data about their health available 
for citizen science projects and new medical research. In this context, participants felt that cyclists would need 
to engage in some form of mutual value exchange, beyond the knowledge of putting data to use for a cause 
they believe in. So what could this value exchange look like?  
Our participants described that a data trust in this context would need to ‘meet Londoner cyclists where they 
are’,  using  technologies  they  are  already  familiar  with.  Given  71%  of  people  in  the  UK  use  a  smart  phone  
every day
80
 and the popularity of mobile apps like Google Maps, CityMapper and Strava, we developed a set 
of wireframes to show what a smartphone app for the London Cycle Data Trust could look like, called Positive 
Cycle. The app would be the interface through which individuals interact with the data trust.

The Positive Cycle app could provide a cycling route planning tool. Our participants felt that a well-designed 
tool, with options based on faster routes, slower routes, and routes taken by other similar cyclists, could attract 
a  significant  body  of  users,  including  those  who  may  not  normally  be  comfortable  with  cycling  in  London.  
Positive Cycle could also provide access to ride statistics and information about previous trips around the city, 
and enable users to rate routes or report poor quality or issues with cycle infrastructure. 
One of the main challenges to attracting users to the London Cycle Data Trust would be in ensuring the users 
of  the  trust  are  representative  of  the  wider  cycling  community.  Levels  of  cycling  will  vary  across  London  
boroughs as a result of a number of factors, including the quality of cycle infrastructure, the demography of its 
residents and levels of digital access and literacy. 
4.1.5. Legal underpinnings of the data trust 
The London Cycle Data Trust, via the Positive Cycle app, would collect and hold at least two types of data, 
both of which would be sensitive. The first is demographic and contextual data, such as gender and ethnicity, 
as well as important locations to the user such as their home, school, and place of work. The second would 
be location and motion data generated through use of the app. 
Under  UK  GDPR,  subjects  of  personal  data
81
  are  granted  eight  extended  rights,  including  the  right  to  
portability,  and  the  London  Cycle  Data  Trust  would  need  to  gain  the  consent  of  the  user  to  process  this  
personal data. Given the well documented limitations of informed consent,
82
 and indeed the spirit of bottom-
up  data  stewardship,  one  participant  suggested  that  the  London  Cycle  Data  Trust  would  need  to  ‘be  
exceedingly  transparent  with  information  about  what  data  is  collected,  how  it  is  used,  and  who  it  is   
shared with’.

Enabling Data Sharing for Social Benefit Through Data Trusts: Data Trusts in Climate 
21 
 
We arrived at two potential legal forms to incorporate the London Cycling Data Trust and bind trustees to clear 
fiduciary duties to the cyclists. 
First, it could be possible to structure it using a ‘true’ legal trust. Research has shown that trusts' origins in 
England and Wales make it a suitable jurisdiction for instantiating data trusts through trust law.
83
 There are 
three certainties required for the creation of an express trust under English law: certainty of intention; certainty 
of subject matter; and certainty of beneficiaries (objects).
84
 
In the case of the London Cycle Data Trust, there would be clarity in the intention of the trust – for cyclists in 
London  to  come  together  to  improve  cycling  infrastructure.  In  this  structure,  the  cyclists  would  be  both  the  
settlers, those who come together to create the trust, and the beneficiaries of the trust, those who receive the 
benefits of the trust, while the ‘trustees’ would have fiduciary duties towards the trust. 
With regards to the certainty of subject matter, trusts have proven to be flexible in adapting to different types 
of assets across centuries, and have already been established for rights relating to intellectual property.
85
 The 
legal literature relating to data trusts suggests that almost any right can be held in trust and that data rights 
could in principle be held in trust.
8687
   However, as yet no examples of trusts holding data rights have been 
established.  This  has  been  recognised  in  literature  around  data  trusts.  Questions  also  remain  around  the  
ability of individuals to delegate rights under GDPR according to Paragraph 24 of the draft Data Governance 
Act.
88
 Participants in our co-design phase indicated that structuring the London Cycle Data Trust as a legal 
trust could be possible, but that ‘we would not know until a data trust was established and implemented in the 
UK’ in this way.  
It  could  also  be  possible  to  create  the  London  Cycle  Data  Trust  using  alternate  legal  form,
89
  such  as  
incorporating it as a company limited by guarantee. Limited by guarantee companies are most often formed 
by non-profit organisations – such as sports clubs, workers' co-operatives and membership organisations – 
whose owners wish to have the benefit of limited financial liability. For this legal structure to be a ‘data trust’, 
it must meet the essential characteristics of a data trust. Based on the definition of a data trust used by GPAI’s

Data  Governance  Working  Group,
90
  as  well  as  other  leading  experts,
91929394
  the  key  component  that 
distinguishes a data trust from other forms of stewardship, is the placing of fiduciary responsibilities on the 
independent trustees. 
In this structure, the cyclists could be members of the company, while the ‘trustees’ would be the directors (of 
the limited company). Directors would have fiduciary duties towards the company
95
 and are regarded as the 
trustees of their office as well as the subject matter or proceeds of the company
96
. They would have separate 
duties to shareholders/members of a fiduciary character.
97
  
Both of these options could prove feasible vehicles for the creation of the London Cycling Data Trust and data 
trusts generally; here more than anywhere there is a need for real-world data trusts to prove what is possible. 
Setting up new organisations is difficult.
98
 A number of participants suggested another option would be for a 
similar, active initiative such as Posmo.Coop or the Bike Data Project
99
 to take on the intended functionality 
of the London Cycle Data Trust. This was on the basis that the main difference between this hypothetical data 
trust and the other initiatives was their lack of independent trustees and fiduciary obligations (two of GPAI’s 
five  functional  elements).  Provided  there  was  demand,  attempting  to  layer  on  these functions  could  be  a  
practical route to instantiating a real-world data trust, rather than starting from scratch in parallel.  
4.1.6. Potential trustees and decision making within the data trust 
As data trusts have yet to become operational, the role of trustee of a data trust has not yet existed. While  
it has been theorised,
100
 and there may be learnings from trustees in other trusts, from the operationalisation 
of fiduciary duties in other domains, and from the charity sector, this is a novel role which would come with 
new challenges.  
The  role  of  trustee  requires  independence  and  ‘undivided  loyalty  and  dedication  to  the  interests  and  
aspirations of the beneficiaries’.
101
 Therefore, the London Cycling Data Trust would need to be made up of a

diverse range of experts without direct ties to the usage of the data. The trustees could include experts on 
data stewardship, city sustainability, and climate change, as well as the digital economy, law, and technology.  
It’s worth noting that the role of a trustee may not be suitable for the settlers of the trust, in this case London 
cyclists, given the legal implications and skills required for the role. A question therefore remains around how 
individuals can meaningfully  participate in decision making about how data is accessed, used and shared 
within a data trust without taking on the role of a trustee. 
The role of trustee would involve acting on behalf of and furthering the interests of the cyclists. It could include 
making granular decisions about who can and cannot access the data brought together and for what purpose, 
and  defining  the  terms  of  data  sharing  agreements  with  third  parties  and  ensuring  they  are  upheld.  The  
trustees  could  also  seek  to  leverage  the  negotiating  power  of  the  pooled  rights  to  secure  more  favourable  
broader outcomes for the beneficiaries. In this case, this could take the form of advocating for specific changes 
to cycling infrastructure, informed by uses of the data, or for changes to data portability legislation to enable 
cyclists to more easily transfer data from other sources to the London Cycling Data Trust.
102
 The role of trustee 
of a data trust, including this one, would be specialised and likely more hands-on than that of a trustee of a 
‘regular’  charity.  Ultimately,  data  trusteeship  could  require  professionalisation,  such  as  in  the  form  of  
qualification, remuneration and defined liability. 
4.1.7. Digital infrastructure and technology 
There are many mobile apps that collect mobility data, such as Strava, Nike Running and Komoot. It’s even 
relatively common among existing bottom-up data stewardship initiatives – for example, Posmo.Coop
103
 is a 
mobility data cooperative that enables people to collect and donate mobility to improve transport planning and 
investment, and Tripshift
104
 helps individuals and businesses to understand their carbon footprint by collecting 
data about the ways they move around. The digital infrastructure of the London Cycle Data Trust is inspired 
by these services, as well the Bike Data Project and Smart Green Journeys. 
Utilising  services  embedded  in  the  iOS  and  Android  operating  systems,  the  London  Cycle  Data  Trust  app  
would  collect  GPS  data  to  capture  how  the  user  is  moving  around
105
,  and  motion  data,
106
  which helps  to  
decipher the form of mobility each journey takes, such as walking, running, cycling and driving. This could be 
combined with data that the user could manually enter, such as demographic information, route preferences 
or even trip ratings. Another option speculated by design phase participants would be to ingest data originally 
collected and held by other, similar services. This could be possible through real time connection via an API 
(such as Strava’s) to enable users to ‘port’ data directly, or allowing bulk uploads for data that the user has 
already downloaded from other services.

Location data is particularly sensitive, as would be the contextual data collected about users by the app. A 
number of participants in the design phase argued strongly that the London Cycle Data Trust would need to 
take a ‘privacy by design’ approach. This could manifest in data collection, whereby for each trip the start and 
end points could be blurred within a 1km radius. Another option would be to limit the granularity of the data 
that organisations can access, such as allowing for a time lag before sharing. A number of participants argued 
for the usage of Privacy Enhancing Technologies (PETs), which could help maintain the utility of the dataset 
for the purposes of AI. When allowing users to access data, techniques like differential privacy, which allows 
the  generation  of  aggregate  statistics  about  a  dataset  but  obfuscates  individual  records
107
,  could  be  used.  
One participant described how developing a synthetic dataset (data that is artificially created rather than being 
generated by actual events)
108
 would allow organisations to develop models to apply to the London Cycling 
Data Trust data while reducing the risks to privacy of the data subjects; these models could be audited by the 
trustees of the London Cycling Data Trust to ensure they are within the bounds of the cyclists’ preferences 
before being applied to the real dataset. Alternatively, Trusted Research Environments – a secure computing 
environment to help keep data secure, whilst making it accessible for researchers to conduct research in a 
safe way
109
– were also posited as an option that would safely allow the data trust to engage with data users.

4.1.8. Financial sustainability and scale 
Access to initial funding, plus the development of a sustainable revenue model, is one of the main challenges 
faced by bottom-up data stewardship initiatives.
110
 Given the lack of precedent for data trusts, the amount of 
funding to establish the London Cycle Data Trust is difficult to estimate. 
Regarding  sources  of  funding,  Transport  for  London  and  the  Greater  London  Authority  have  a  history  of  
supporting data initiatives. Other options include philanthropic funders based in the UK – for example, The 
National   Lottery,   which   supports   a   number   of   community-based   initiatives.   Similarly,   philanthropic   
organisations with an interest in data stewardship may take an interest in a practical application of a data trust. 
One participant suggested that bike companies and other mobility providers could be motivated to provide 
support, on the basis that the London Cycling Data Trust would improve the cycling experience, and in the 
long run, possibly even boost cyclist numbers. 
The  London  Cycle  Data Trust  would  need  to  attract  a  critical  mass  of  users.  It  would  need  to  accumulate  
(control of) a dataset of a certain size, breadth and/or depth so as to offer something useful to other actors in 
the ecosystem. One expert articulated that “it’s difficult to put a number on a critical mass of users, because 
it depends not only on how many journeys, but also on the contextual data that explains those journeys”. In 
other words, a dataset of 100 journeys with context (age, ethnicity, gender of the rider, and data about the 
start and end locations) may be more useful than a dataset of 10,000 journeys which detail a route taken from 
the same A to B. 
Once it has such a critical mass of data, the London Cycle Data Trust could attempt to adopt a sustainable 
business model. Revenue could be generated by charging for licences to access the data to organisations 
(which the trustees deem to align with the preferences of the cyclists)
111
. Alongside, for public sector access, 
the approach taken by the High Street Data Project, which aims ‘to provide organisations ongoing access to 
the best local high streets and town centre data at low cost’
112
, could be used. For this, the Greater London 
Authority purchased access to large datasets from Mastercard and O2 on behalf of the 33 boroughs and then 
used in-house capabilities to analyse the data streams and provide insights back to them. Such a model would 
suit the London Cycle Data Trust as it takes into account the relative digital skills and capacity of each borough 
to analyse data, and it mimics the current decision-making flow for the development of cycling infrastructure. 
With  this  differential  approach,  the  London  Cycle  Data  Trust  should  be  able  to  enable  access  to  data  for  
reduced  fees  (or  even  free)  to  certain  types  of  organisations,  like  academic  institutions  or  civil  society  
organisations. Further down the line, the London Cycle Data Trust could offer consultancy, insights and other 
services ‘on-top-of the data’.

4.2 Exploring a Data Trust for Small Shareholder Farming in India 
 
Summary 
• Context: Populations in developing countries are more likely to be affected by climate  
change’s impacts on agriculture, owing to a greater dependence on agriculture.  
Small shareholder farmers make up nearly 86% of all farmers in India.  
• Key actors: The ecosystem consists of small shareholder farmers, government,  
research institutions, private firms, intermediaries and local traders. 
• Opportunity: Current data collection efforts in this domain are disparate and their resultant 
datasets being largely siloed, with little benefit accruing to farmers themselves. 
• Potential data trust: A data trust in this domain could help farmers gain value from their data  
in the form of more tailored advisories for improving the efficiency of their practices, and also 
provide hyperlocal agricultural information to other stakeholders. 
• Legal form: While existing legal forms such as registered societies could be used to set up  
a data trust, the lack of a data protection legislation in India provides limited legal guardrails. 
• Governance: Given the power imbalance between farmers and other stakeholders in the 
ecosystem, trustees would have a heightened responsibility in deciding how data stewarded  
by a data trust would be used. 
• Technology: Existing technologies could be leveraged to facilitate the collection, sharing  
and management of data in this domain, but difficulties caused by low levels of digital literacy, 
low internet connectivity and a lack of data standards. 
• Sustainability: A data trust may not need a very large number of farmers to take part to create  
a useful dataset, although funding for data initiatives in India is hard to come by.

4.2.1. Introduction to the domain 
Climate change has had a tremendous impact on agriculture. Higher temperatures lead to a decrease in yield 
(crop production), while encouraging the proliferation of pests and diseases.
113
 Changes in the frequency and 
severity of droughts and floods pose challenges for farmers and threaten food safety.
114
 Through a combined 
effect of increased temperatures and shifts in precipitation cycles, farmers the world over are also now unable 
to harvest crops traditionally grown on their lands, and the nutritional value of many crops is reducing.
115
 
Agriculture,  in  turn,  contributes  to  climate  change.  Agriculture  is  one  of  the  greatest  contributors  to  global  
warming,  through  greenhouse  gas  emissions.
116
  In  2010,  agriculture,  forestry  and  land-use  change  were  
estimated  to  contribute  20–25%  of  global  annual  emissions.
117
  In  2020,  the  European  Union's  Scientific   
Advice Mechanism estimated
118
 that the food system as a whole contributed 37% of total greenhouse gas 
emissions, and that this figure was on course to increase by 30–40% by 2050 due to population growth and 
dietary change. 
While populations living in developing countries are already vulnerable and food insecure, they are also likely 
to be the most affected by the impacts of climate change on agriculture, owing to their greater dependence 
on agriculture.
119
 The Asia-Pacific region may also experience the worst effect on wheat and rice (the two 
main staples in India) worldwide, with crop models indicating average yield levels for wheat and rice in 2050 
to decrease from 2000 yield levels by 50% and 17% respectively.
120
 
Small and marginal shareholder farmers account for 86% of the total number of farmers in India.
121
 They are 
hampered by low productivity, due to a combination of being unable to afford advanced machinery and an 
inability  to  implement  modern  farming  practices.  Despite  this,  they  contribute  to  51%  of  India’s  agricultural  
output, and 70% of all high-value crops,
122
 highlighting their importance in the food supply chain.

4.2.2. The small shareholder farming ecosystem in India 
Small  shareholder  farmers  comprise  an  overwhelming  majority  of  the  farmers  in  India,  but  despite  this  
contribute to less than 50% of the total cropping area.
123
 Such farmers tend to hold very small pieces of land 
– around 37% of farm households owned land parcels smaller than 0.4 hectares and 30% had holdings which 
fell between 0.41 and 1.0 hectares.
124
 Small shareholder farmers in India are typically from rural areas and 
have low incomes.
125
 
Intermediaries, who are referred to in various terms across different regions in India, play a critical role in the 
small  shareholder  farming  ecosystem.  These  intermediaries  provide  a  variety  of  services  including  credit  
lending, transportation, aggregation of produce as well as advisory roles.
126
 Given the importance of these 
intermediaries  in  obtaining  essential  services,  farmers  tend  to  put  a  lot  of  faith  in  them  and  they  hold   
significant power. 
Given their small margins, and inability to store and transport crops, small shareholder farmers rely on local 
private  traders.
127
  These  traders  typically  buy  crops  from  a  number  of  small  shareholder  farmers  to  then  
store and sell it further. These traders exist as an option to farmers alongside the APMC ‘mandis’, government 
regulated primary markets which guarantee farmers a minimum sale price.
128
 
Governance of agriculture in India is divided between the central and state governments, set out by Article 
246 of the constitution.
129
 The central and state governments provide a number of welfare schemes to farmers, 
however there is a deficit of trust in many areas of India between farmers and the central government, which 
has been exacerbated
130
 by the recently repealed farm laws and protests.
131
 
The Indian Council for Agricultural Research (ICAR)
132
 and state agricultural research institutions issue 
regular advisories to farmers, including weather-based crop advice
133
 and manuals that provide guidance on 
water management,
134
 land preparation,
135
 and cultivation of specific varieties of crops.

Private  firms  in  the  agriculture  sector  in  India  include  seed  suppliers  and fertiliser  manufacturers.  In  
addition to providing the necessary farming materials and equipment, certain private companies also provide 
farmers with income security. For example, by providing seeds to farmers at a discounted rate, along with 
guidance on how to grow the crop, provided they can buy the harvest directly from the farmers. 
There are also now a number of agtech companies that are looking to deploy new technologies to improve 
farming practices in the sector. Climate-smart agriculture,
137
 for example, is an initiative that looks to adopt an 
integrative approach to increase productivity (crop yield), enhance crop resilience, and reduce emissions.   
4.2.3. The opportunity to improve how data is stewarded 
Via  our  co-design  participants,  we  learned  that  current  efforts  to  collect,  use  and  share  data  about  small  
shareholder farming in India are driven by two main forces. 
The first is to increase the transparency of supply chains, which is essential for the certification of ‘organic’ or 
‘pesticide free’ produce. In this case, companies selling to end consumers collect information regarding the 
types of fertiliser, and insect prevention used by farmers. However, this information is not collected directly 
from farmers, but from the local traders from whom the produce is bought by the companies. There is no direct 
benefit from such data collection being borne to the farmers.  
The second is undertaken by the government for multiple purposes such as designing welfare programmes 
and  informing  the  state  of  agricultural  output.  This  data  collection  is  usually  carried  out  through  procured  
partners and  is  often  paper-based.  Similar  types  of  information  are  collected  by  different  departments  and  
stored in different formats, fuelled by the lack of prescribed standards within this domain. Over the last few 
years, the Indian government has shown an increasing interest in digitising the agriculture sector via initiatives 
like AgriStack
138
, which aims ‘to build a National Digital Agriculture Ecosystem, to elevate Indian Agriculture 
Sector to higher levels of efficiency and productivity, and to improve the welfare and income of farmers.’
139
 
However, it is unclear what access farmers will have to the data collected by these initiatives, as well as how 
they will derive benefits from the activities. Additionally, it is unclear whom their data will be shared with and 
what uses it will be put to. 
In  practice,  these  collection  efforts  do  not  foreground  the  needs  and  concerns  of  the  farmers,  rather  they  
typically approach data collection through a lens of either broader public good or private gains. As a result, 
there is very little-to no benefits accruing to farmers from data collection initiatives. 
The  participants  of  the  co-design  phase  for  this  domain  showed  interest  in  the  idea  of  bottom-up  data  
stewardship, as they felt it could help to reverse current data practices, where farmers could take the initiative, 
exert  more  control  over  the  data  about  their  farming  and  benefit  from  its  use.  We  learned  of  bottom-up 
initiatives in other parts of the word like the Birchip Cropping Group,
140
 which is a farmer-led organisation in

Victoria,  Australia  aiming  to  improve  the  prosperity  of  farmers  and  agricultural  communities  by  providing  
evidence, support and tools for improving farm management practices and profitability. 
The  diversity  in  India’s  geology  and  weather  patterns  represent  another  opportunity  to  improve  data  use  
around  small  shareholder  farming.  One  of  our  participants  described  how  the  highly  varying  nature  of  
environmental conditions across the country renders pan-India standardisation of farming guidance futile. This 
suggests that local groups of farmers could coalesce to generate hyperlocal datasets, which could be shared 
with the government, research institutions and agtech firms, in return for services and advice better suited to 
their  environmental  circumstances  and  needs  (for  example,  related  to  appropriate  seeds,  efficient  water  
consumption, and sustainable land and soil usage). 
4.2.4. The potential of a data trust in this domain 
Small shareholder farmers could come together to set up a data trust. The data trust could collect data from 
the farmers, such as farm size, soil type and quality, water usage, types of seeds used, types and quantities 
of fertilisers, insecticides and pesticides used and crop yield.  
The data collected could then be aggregated and shared by the trust on privacy respecting terms with relevant 
stakeholders. Privacy is crucial in this context, as a lot of this data could be used to aid private firms’ land 
grabbing,
141
 or to introduce farmers into new systems of credit rating that could be potentially exploitative and 
biased.
142
 These stakeholders could include the government, research institutions and private sector firms. 
This  data  could  be  used  by  the  government  and  public  research  institutions  to  gain  a  more  accurate  and  
hyperlocal  understanding  of  the  agriculture  practices  adopted  by  farmers.  The  sharing  of  data  with  these  
stakeholders would take place under terms that are in line with the farmers’ preferences as indicated to the 
trustees.  The  data  could  also  be  used  by  private  sector  firms  to  train  and  fine  tune  smart  agriculture  
technologies, again if permissible under those preferences. 
Importantly, in return, the farmers could access more tailored advice and information on sustainable farming 
practices, which could also help them increase their yield.

Figure 4: a potential data trust for small shareholder farmers in India 
 
During  the  co-design  process,  we  spent  time  with  stakeholders  that  work  closely  with  small  shareholder  
farmers or have experience in establishing new data initiatives in agriculture. In general, these participants 
were doubtful as to whether this constituted enough of an incentive for farmers to engage with a data trust. 
To  begin  with,  participants  described  that  many  small  shareholders  farmers  in  India  have  rigid,  traditional 
attitudes towards farming practices and based on negative experiences in the past, would be sceptical of a 
new data collection effort. 
Moreover, data is unlikely to be high up on small shareholder farmers’ agenda. One farmer we spoke to noted 
that using data to understand the impact of climate on their farming or to increase the sustainability of their 
practices is not a priority concern. Rather, the main concerns for farmers lie in obtaining access to capital and 
finding  new  markets  for  their  produce.  While  it  was  suggested  by  one  participant  that  the  data  trust  could  
ingest  financial  information  from  farmers  and  use  it  ‘to  create  creditworthiness  ratings  to  enable  access  to  
credit’, this did not feel like a suitable use case to us. This could introduce farmers to a new financial system, 
which could be opaque and discriminatory.

Another  issue  we  encountered  were  low  levels  of  digital  access  and  literacy  among  farmers  in  India,  with  
digital literacy levels of farmers in rural areas varying from 13% to 26%.
144
 Taken in tandem with poor data 
connectivity, this would make it incredibly difficult for farmers to engage with a data trust, even if there was 
sufficient incentive. 
Participants  in  our  design  phase  suggested  that  an  external  organisation  would  be  needed  to  convey  to  
farmers the potential value of engaging and to help ‘onboard’ them. On this basis, we considered that a civil 
society organisation, with expertise in establishing new data initiatives, could partner with existing community-
level  farmer  organisations  such  as  a  regional  farmer  producer  or  a  farmer  cooperative  to  drive  the  
development of a data trust on behalf of the community. Participants posited the idea of engaging ‘field agents’ 
to help in conducting outreach, building capacity, and collecting data and directing it to the data trust. These 
field agents could act as an intermediary between the farmers and the data trust, and even share and help 
farmers interpret the advisories they receive in exchange.

4.2.5. Legal underpinnings of the data trust 
Many of the types of data that could be collected by this data trust – details about framing practices, and soil 
quality, seeds used, water usage, etc – would likely constitute non-personal data under the proposed Data 
Protection  Bill.  The  report  by  the  Committee  of  Experts  on  Non-Personal  Data  Governance  Framework  
(NPDR)
145
 outlined certain key principles for governing non-personal data in India, including the recognition 
of community rights over data, and recommended the need for a separate law to govern it. However, this has 
not yet been acted upon. 
The data trust could of course also need to steward some personal data about the farmers themselves. India 
does  not  have  a  data  protection  legislation,  with  a  bill  to  regulate  data  governance  still  being  debated  in  
Parliament.
146
 Data protection is therefore regulated in India by the Information Technology Act, 2000 (IT Act) 
and rules made under it.
147
 The IT Act’s conception of data protection is limited to aspects of consent, access 
and correction rights.
148
 In addition to this, the Supreme Court of India has recognised a constitutional right to 
privacy for individuals.
149
  
Within the Indian agriculture sector, the AgriStack project seeks to digitise the agriculture sector in India and 
create an ecosystem for the sharing of agriculture data. However, the only guidance document on this project 
currently is a consultation paper, which does not go into specific details about the exact provisions that will 
govern data sharing within this domain.
150
 The report by Aapti Institute and the ODI on ‘Enabling data sharing 
for social benefit through data trusts’ provides a detailed overview of other data sharing initiatives currently 
being explored by the Indian government.
151
  
There are therefore limited legal guard rails for developing this data trust. It could be argued that there is also 
no law that prevents the collection, use and sharing of these types of data in India. However, this could be a 
problematic route to follow – it could allow for instances of misuse of data, either by trustees or third parties. 
While there are fiduciary obligations in the former case, the only recourse in the latter instance would be under 
contract law, with the terms of the contract dictating the level of remedies available to farmers. 
In terms of a legal structure for the data trust, it could not be incorporated as a true legal trust under the Indian 
Trusts Act, 1882. This is because Section 8 of the Indian Trusts Act, 1882 is very clear that the subject matter 
of the trust must be property that can be transferred to the beneficiary, and jurisprudence on trust law in India 
is clear that there needs to be property capable of being transferred as a subject matter of the trust, which is 
not possible in the present case, as arguments for treating data as property are tenuous.

It could be possible to structure the data trust as either a private company registered under the Companies 
Act, 2013
153
 or as a Society registered under the Societies Registration Act, 1860.
154
 In the former case, the 
farmers would be the shareholders of the company, with the independent trustees serving as directors of the 
company. Directors of a company in India are recognised to have fiduciary duties towards the company (the 
data  trust  in  this  case).
155
  It  could  be  beneficial  to  register  the  trust  as  a  Society,  with  the  fiduciary  
responsibilities of the trustees being codified in the memorandum of association of the trust. These are only 
mooted  legal  structures,  as  the  issue  regarding  lack  of  data  protection  in  India  serves  as  an  overarching  
concern in this domain, irrespective of the legal structure of the data trust. 
4.2.6. Potential trustees and decision making within the data trust 
In this context, trustees would play a very critical role in stewarding data on behalf of the small shareholder 
farmers, owing to the existing power imbalance between the farmers and the actors in the ecosystem, such 
as government and private firms. 
As we’ve discussed, small shareholder farmers have low levels of digital literacy and are extremely reliant  
on local intermediaries to provide services such as access to credit, provision of machinery and transportation 
of crops to the market. Data held by the data trust would have the potential to provide insights that could be 
used by malicious actors for private gains at the detriment of farmers –for example, bottoming of prices for 
crops, biased credit rating of farmers and possibly even acquisition of fertile farmland from individual farmers 
at low prices. 
It would fall on the trustees to ensure they use the highest degree of care in deciding who may access the 
data and enforce any data sharing arrangements. The data trust could be governed by a board of trustees 
made  up  of  experts  with  diverse  expertise,  including  data  stewardship,  agriculture,  climate  change,  
technology,  law  and  the  digital  economy.  The  board  could  also  have  a  respected  member  of  the  local  
community as a trustee.  
However,  there  are  unanswered  questions  around  the  incentives  for  an  individual  to  take  on  the  role  of  a  
trustee  within  a  data  trust.  The  role  is  likely  to  be  under  high  pressure,  with  trustees  under  an  increased  
fiduciary obligation to not only act in the best interests of the beneficiaries, but to also ensure that the data of 
the  members  of  the  trust  is  not  misused.  There  would  also  likely  be  a  requirement  of  a  minimum  level  of  
remuneration to the trustees.

35 
 
4.2.7. Digital infrastructure and technology 
In our co-design phase, a number of existing technologies that could be used by the data trust were highlighted 
to us. FarmOS, a web-based app for farm management, planning, and record keeping,
156
 could be used by 
farmers with access to digital technologies, as well as the trust itself to steward data on their behalf. 
We had originally considered whether data could be collected by a mobile app, similar to the London Cycle 
Data  Trust.  However,  given  the  low  levels  of  digital  literacy  and  digital  access  amongst  farmers,  and  as  
discussed in previous sections, field agents from the local community could be trained to collect data from 
small shareholder farmers. Field agents could use tools such as SurveryCTO, Survey Stack or KoboCollect. 
The advantage of tools such as SurveyCTO is that they enable offline collection of data, which is essential 
given the relatively low levels of internet connectivity in rural areas. 
Data  collected  by  the  trust  could  be  aggregated  and  stored  on  a  cloud  server  –  for  which  there  are  many  
providers. As we discuss in previous sections, the data being collected from farmers would largely be non-
personal in nature. However, there may still be risks of harm, and it would be imperative that the data was 
stored securely. Given that the majority of small shareholder farmers are not digitally literate, there will be a 
massive burden on the trustees to put in place technologies that share data with users securely and in ways 
that could not be against their interests. 
One of our participants noted that “this isn’t as much a technology problem as it is a data interoperability and 
policy problem”. The lack of standards for the types of data considered in this domain means that the data 
trust  would,  at  least,  have  a  role  to  play  in  cleaning  and  standardising  the  data  if  intending  to  aggregate  it  
across farms. In the longer run, it could convene different parties to develop those standards openly
157
, so 
that they work for the different actors in the ecosystem. 
In terms of disseminating the results of use of data accessed via the data trust, we learned of the need to 
consider ‘informal’ outputs. The advisories on farming practices supplied to farmers, for example,  could be 
shared via Whatsapp or other popular messaging services.

4.2.8. Financial sustainability 
Participants highlighted that funding for data initiatives in agriculture in India is hard to come by, and successful 
examples have largely been fundraised from farmers themselves and/or via online crowdfunding campaigns.  
It does not appear that the Indian government would look to fund the set up of a data trust in this context. One 
participant with experience of philanthropic funding noted that, historically, philanthropic funders have funded 
initiatives that collect large amounts of data and unlock them for public value in a relatively short period of 
time, whereas it may take considerable time for a data trust of this type to gather data at sufficient scale.  
The capability of farmers to engage in data collection practices, and the outcomes from data use, also has a 
bearing on the financial sustainability of the data trust. For a data trust to function successfully, a necessary 
precondition would be to have farmers who are well-funded and motivated enough to be able to implement 
the new sustainable practices recommended to them. As these would typically involve capital expenditures 
on the part of farmers, the data trust would also need to find a way to provide monetary support to farmers – 
it couldn’t exist in a vacuum. Likewise, the use of field agents to accurately collect and upload data would 
require an investment in training and ongoing compensation, which would be a significant cost. 
In order to sustain itself, the data trust could look to adopt a similar differentiated pricing model to the London 
Cycle  Data  Trust,  whereby  it  charged  for  licences  to  access  the  data  to  organisations  (which  the  trustees  
deem  to  align  with  the  preferences  of  the  farmers),  while  allowing  for  subsidised  or  free  access  for  others  
(such as the farmers themselves). In terms of a critical mass of farmers to take part in this type of data trust, 
participants suggested that it might not be very high, given the current dearth of timely, hyperlocal data in the 
ecosystem.  Adoption  by  even  100  farmers  from  one  particular  area  may  be  sufficient  for  the  data  to  be  
meaningful enough to create valuable tailored advisories.  
Again, given that data trusts currently do not exist,
158
 it is difficult to estimate what financial resources would 
be required to establish a data trust in this domain.

https://gpai.ai/projects/data-governance/data-trusts/enabling-data-sharing-for-social-benefit-through-data-trusts.pdf   
159 
One participant suggested that it might be possible to set up a data trust in this context for 100-200 farmers for US 
$1.2million, based on their understanding of the design and experience in setting up other data initiatives. This is only a 
mooted figure, and actual costs could vary dramatically.

4.3 A Data Trust for Indigenous Climate Migration in Peru 
 
Summary 
• Context: In South America, Peru has been identified as one of the countries facing the high 
rates of future displacement due to climate change, with indigenous communities in Peru being 
some of the most vulnerable to these impacts. 
• Key actors: The ecosystem consists of indigenous communities, 55 indingenous nations, 
several indigenous representative organisations, the Peruvian Government, small non-
governmental actors, larger multinational organisations and academic institutions. 
• Opportunity: There is a need for data to better identify and understand climate-driven 
displacement, and indigenous communities in Peru have been active in establishing greater 
control over their data. 
• Potential data trust: A data trust could act as steward of qualitative data sets related to 
indigenous climate displacement from across Peru, ensuring that the data is shared with 
trustworthy organisations, and importantly, accessible to displaced communities themselves. 
• Legal form: Peru has some data rights afforded by data protection law and legal trusts,  
although establishing a data trust would involve considerable challenges related to the  
sensitivity of the data. 
• Governance: The most suitable candidates for trustees, or indeed hosts, of the data trust would 
be indigenous representative organisations already in operation in the region, building on 
developments in the broader field of indigenous data sovereignty and stewardship. 
• Technology: Qualitative data could be collected through a smartphone app or voice recording 
software, and there may be opportunities to apply natural language processing to identify 
patterns in the data.  
• Sustainability: Philanthropic funding could be the most realistic option to establish a data trust 
in  this domain, especially given the non-profit nature of the organisations involved.

4.3.1. Introduction to the domain 
Climate change has a severe impact on human mobility, driving both national and international movement as 
people flee rising sea levels, increasing temperatures, drought, floods and extreme weather events. In 2020, 
close to seven million people in 104 countries were living in displacement as a result of disasters, with 98% 
of the new displacements occurring due to weather-related events.
160
 
As climate change continues to worsen, these numbers are predicted to grow, with the World Bank predicting 
that more than 143 million people could be displaced within their own country by 2050.
161
 
In  South  America,  the  International  Organisation  for  Migration  has  identified  Peru  as  one  of  the  most  
vulnerable to the impacts of climate change including a significant rise in climate migration, and specifically 
internal displacement and migration
162
. Due to its geographical location, climate and environment, the country 
is at an increased risk of flooding, extreme weather events, food and water scarcity and increased disease 
transmission. In 2021 alone, intense flooding led to 8,000 new internal displacements, more than doubling the 
numbers from the previous year.
163
  
The  Peruvian  government  has  addressed  these  concerns  through  the  implementation  of  its  Framework   
Law  on  Climate  Change,  outlining  its  plan  for  tackling  the  adverse  impacts  of  climate  change,  including  
increased  climate  migration
164
.  Both  the  law  and  associated  report  identified  the  importance  of  indigenous  
participation in the national discussion and set goals for implementing an action plan to address and reduce 
climate migration.
165
  
Indigenous leaders, advocates, front line defenders and communities have a long history of working to slow 
and  reverse  the  effects  of  climate  change  and  environmental  damage  in  Peru  and  beyond.
166
  They  have  
successfully fought for increased land rights, indigenous land stewardship and stronger legislation
167
, forging 
international alliances such as Coordinadora De Las Organizaciones Indígenas De La Cuenca Amazónica 
and the Ceibo Alliance.

4.3.2. The indigenous climate migration ecosystem in Peru 
There  are  roughly  4  million  indigenous  people  living  in  Peru,  making  up  55  indigenous  nations
168
, 
according to the International Working Group for Indigenous Affairs. 
There are several well recognised indigenous representative organisations throughout Peru. For example, 
the Amarakaeri ECA, an indigenous organisation made up of ten native communities, manages and promotes 
the protection and holistic management of the Amarakaeri Communal Reserve (RCA).
169
 Associations such 
as the Interethnic Association for the Development of the Peruvian Jungle (AIDESEP) and Coordinator of the 
Indigenous Organisations of the Amazon Basin (COICA), are working towards common goals of protecting 
indigenous  ancestral  land,  promoting  planetary  health  and  guaranteeing  indigenous  rights.
170,171
    These 
organisations  have  leadership  boards  consisting  of  representatives  from  each  participating  community,  
selected by the communities themselves.
172,173,174
  
The   relationship   between   the   Peruvian   government   and   indegenous   communities   is   undergoing   
considerable  changes,  as  these  communities  organise  and  develop  their  own  governing  bodies.
175
  For 
example,  in  2015,  the  Wampis  People  of  Peru  declared  the  ‘formation  of  the  first  Autonomous  Indigenous  
Government  in  Peru’  with  a  goal  of  preserving  1.3  million  hectare  of  ancestral  territory  and  encouraging  
sustainability and harmony with the national world.
176
 The national government has recognised indigenous 
people  as  extremely  vulnerable  to  the  impacts  of  climate  change  and  at  a  high  risk  of  potential  
displacement.
177
  
There  are  small,  non-governmental  actors active  in  Peru,  such  as  Hivos
178
,  which  provides  support  to  
indigenous  organisations  through  its  All  Eyes  On  the  Amazon  programme,  and  Climate  Refugees,  an  
organisation based in New York that provides vital insights into underlying climate drivers of displacement and 
migration.
179
 There are also larger, multinational organisations such as the International Organisation for 
Migration  and  the  Internal  Displacement  Monitoring  Centre,  which  support  international  action related  to  
climate migration and displacement.

Several academic  institutions  are  involved  in  the  study  of  climate-driven  internal  displacement.  These  
include programmes such as Stanford Earth, which focuses on researching planned relocation as a form of 
climate  adaptation,  and  the  University  of  Liège’s  Hugo  Observatory,  an  interdisciplinary  research  centre  
dedicated to the study of human migration and its relation to environmental changes and policy.
180,181 
 
4.3.3. The opportunity to improve how data is stewarded 
Climate as a driver of migration and displacement is notoriously difficult to identify. It was recently discovered, 
for example, that future migration caused by rising sea levels had been underestimated by a factor of three, 
with new estimates showing roughly 150 million people at risk of displacement by 2050.
182
 This difficulty was 
something repeatedly expressed by participants in our co-design phase. 
Migrants  will  often  identify  economic  reasons  for  moving,  such  as  low  crop  yields  without  recognising  that  
slow-onset climate change is a driving factor. As a result of this, one of the most important methods used to 
understand  climate  migration  is  qualitative  interviews  with  displaced  people.  At  the  moment,  only  a  few  
organisations  are  carrying  these  out  with  a  climate  focus,  including  non-governmental  organisations  like  
Climate Refugees, and academic institutions such as the University of Liège and Stanford. These are typically 
conducted  in  a  semi-structured  format,  with  recorded  verbal  consent.  This  style  of  data  collection  allows  
interviewers  to  investigate  underlying  drivers  of  displacement  that  are  easily  missed  on  more  structured  
methods such as surveys. 
A number of our participants indicated that, while this type of research provided vital information on climate 
displacement, these institutions can hold data away from the indigenous communities and organisations the 
data  originates  from.  Combined  with  the  fact  that  many  of  these  institutions  are  based  in  the  global  north,  
rather than in Peru or the wider South American region, some criticised this as ‘data extractivism’.  
However, indigenous groups across the Amazon have begun using data themselves to advocate for increased 
land rights, the application of indigenous land stewardship and stronger climate legislation.
183
 All Eyes on the 
Amazon,  for  example,
184
  alongside  Mapeo  and  Global  Forest  Watch,  have  been  identifying  and  mapping  
deforestation, illegal mining and oil production in their territories and indigenous communities have used this 
data to launch investigations that hold these operations accountable.

Indigenous organisations throughout the Amazon have outlined further objectives that could be supported by 
better data collection, use and sharing, including the protection of uncontacted indigenous communities, and 
active participation in the management of non-renewable resources in their territories.
186
 We also learned how 
data could be used by indigenous communities to support legal claims and advocate for stronger legislation. 
The participants  of  the  co-design  phase  showed  interest  in  applying  bottom-up  data  stewardship  in  this  
domain,  as  a  tool  to  enable  indigenous  communities  to  manage  data  about  climate  displacement  for  their   
own benefit. 
4.3.4. The potential of a data trust in this domain 
Indigenous  communities  and  organisations  could  come  together  to  form  a  climate  and  displacement  data  
trust,  electing  representatives  to  act  as  trustees.  The  data  trust  in  this  context  could  act  as  a  steward  of  
qualitative  datasets  related  to  climate  migration  from  across  Peru,  ensuring  that  the  data  is  shared  with  
trustworthy organisations, and importantly, is accessible to displaced people themselves. As we describe in 
later sections, it could provide a powerful mechanism for indigenous data stewardship. 
Similar to the Indian small shareholder farming domain, there could be a need for field agents to collect the 
data, in the form of recording interviews. This is because according to some of our participants, qualitative 
information on climate drivers of internal displacement are rare. Additionally, work done by the First Nations 
Information Governance Centre (FNIGC) has highlighted how data collection designed and conducted by the 
indigenous  people  themselves  can  be  far  more  effective  for  their  causes,  than  methods  designed  and  
collected by non-indigenous groups.
187
 There would also be potential for the data trust to partner with groups 
focusing on these areas such as academics, humanitarian organisations and migration researchers, to help 
develop and facilitate data collection.  
The data collected could be aggregated, processed to ensure privacy and security, and shared with relevant 
stakeholders  according  to  the  terms  set  out  by  trust  members.  These  stakeholders  could  include  climate  
advocacy  groups,  environmental  defenders,  humanitarian  organisations,  and  academic  and  research  
institutions. These stakeholders could use this data to gain a better understanding of the underlying climate-
drivers  of  human  mobility.  Participants  suggested  that  the  datasets  could  also  be  used  to  train  machine  
learning  models  to  create  more  accurate  predictive  models  of  future  climate  driven  human  migration  and  
displacement. These models could help governments and communities prepare for changes in their urban 
and rural areas and ensure that resources are funnelled into the regions that need it the most. Most importantly 
however, these datasets could be applied by the indigenous nations themselves in cases related to land rights, 
indigenous environmental stewardship and active investigations into illegal mining and deforestation activities 
that put them at greater risk for climate-driven displacement.

Figure 6: a potential data trust for indigenous climate migration in Peru 
 
During  the  co-design  phase  for  this  domain,  we  engaged  with  organisations  with  experience  working  with  
indigenous  groups  in  Peru  such  as  Climate  Refugees,  Hivos/All  Eyes  on  the  Amazon,  International  
Organisation for Migration, Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre, International Service for Human Rights 
and Refugees International. 
Participants in the co-design process, especially those who were working on the ground in direct collaboration 
with  indigenous  people  in  Peru,  were  confident  that  these  communities  were  highly  motivated  to  establish  
greater ownership and control over their data, and to participate in data collection themselves. They described 
that in response to the impact climate changes are having on their lives – including forced displacement, loss 
of ancestral lands and customs, and adverse impacts on their health and wellbeing – many communities have 
already developed data-sharing agreements and data-collection programmes, to help advocate for action. 
However,  they  indicated  that  a  data  trust  in  this  context  may  need  to  look  different  to  those  in  other  
geographical and cultural environments. One participant described how the definitions and interpretations of 
concepts like ‘bottom-up stewardship’ and ‘data trusts’ may need to be adapted in this context, in recognition 
of  different  perspectives  and  worldviews.  This  is  especially  important  considering  the  number  of  unique  

Enabling Data Sharing for Social Benefit Through Data Trusts: Data Trusts in Climate 
43 
 
indigenous nations in Peru – each with its own views and requirements for how these concepts should be 
applied to its people, potentially leading to several different interpretations. 
 
Figure 7: Storyboard indicating how a potential data trust in this domain could function
 
  

Enabling Data Sharing for Social Benefit Through Data Trusts: Data Trusts in Climate 
44 
 
4.3.5. Legal underpinnings of the data trust 
Peru  first  introduced  the  right  to  data  protection  in  1993,  and  established  the  Peruvian  Data  Protection 
Authority  to  oversee  both  past  and  subsequent  legislation.
188
  Since  then,  it  has  enacted  several  laws  and  
regulations related to data rights and privacy including Law number 29733 on the Protection of Personal Data, 
Law number 30096 on Cyber Crime, and Emergency Decree Number 007-2020 which includes measures to 
guarantee confidentiality of information.
189
 
While these laws provide important legislative protection and rights to personal data, applying a data trust in 
this domain involves considerable challenges related to the sensitivity of both the data being collected and 
the  population  it  is  being  collected  from.  In  the  Plan  of  Action  on  Gender  and  Climate  Change  in  Peru,  
commissioned by the Peruvian Government, indigenous communities were repeatedly identified as one of the 
most vulnerable populations to the impacts of climate change.
190
 These vulnerabilities come from a series of 
factors including language barriers, access to resources, cultural differences, legislative barriers to land rights 
and indigenous  governance,  and  limited  access  to  education.  Indigenous  Peruvians  have  also  faced  
discrimation from both national and international governments as well as non-idigenous communities in Peru, 
including targeted and sometimes lethal attacks on indigenous land defenders.
191
 
This raises significant concerns regarding potential risks to the personal safety of communities from whom 
data would originate. In general, while we believe that there is an opportunity to improve how data is stewarded 
in this domain, policymakers and other practitioners should seek to apply data trusts – an unproven form of 
stewardship – in other domains first. 
However, if it did come to establishing a data trust like this in law, Peru has trust law through law 26702 the 
General Law of the Financial and Insurance Systems and Organic Law of the Superintendence of Banking 
and Insurance. This legislation does allow for settlors to transfer rights, stating ‘the essential requirement of 
validity for the constitution of the trust is that the settlor has the power to dispose of the assets and rights to 
be transferred’.
192
 In theory, this could support the rights of displaced people to transfer their data rights to a 
data  trust.  It  is  important  to  note  however,  that  at  this  time,  the  legal  frameworks  around  trust  law  in  Peru  
pertain primarily to the financial and banking systems, leaving significant questions regarding how it may be 
applied to data. Due to this, it is possible that a data trust in this country would need to take on a different 
legal form, perhaps of a corporation.

4.3.6. Potential trustees and decision making within the data trust 
In  this  domain,  the  most  suitable  candidates  for  trustees  of  the  data  trust  would  be  the  indigenous 
organisations already operating in the region, such as those mentioned in 4.3.2. These groups have extensive 
experience  working  with  both  national  and  international  organisations,  knowledge  of  data  stewardship  and  
drafting data sharing agreements, and a social responsibility of fiduciary-like duties towards their communities. 
Additionally,  these  organisations  already  have  systems  for  electing  indigenous  representatives  to  the  
organisations’ boards, indicating that a similar process could be used for selecting organisation members to 
sit on the board of trustees of the data trust.
193
 
Participants in our co-design phase suggested that if any non-indigenous representatives were to sit on the 
board, they would need to be selected by the indigenous communities themselves, or by the representative 
organisations on behalf of their communities. 
Trustees  would  have  the  responsibility  of  protecting  the  data  and  ensuring  that  any  sharing  and  uses  of  it  
further the objectives laid out by the indigenous communities. This would be especially important during times 
of displacement,  when  communities  are  most  vulnerable.  Many  of  these  indigenous  organisations  have  
experience  negotiating  data  sharing  agreements,  collecting  data,  organising  protection  for  data  collection  
programmes  and  applying  data  to  climate  initiatives  and  objectives.
194
  Indeed,  it  could  be  that  an  existing  
idigneous organisation could itself take on the role of the data trust. 
One  of  our  participants  described  that,  based  on  their  experience,  indigenous  cultures  in  Peru  may  have  
wholly different understandings and outlooks towards community and decision-making than the practitioners 
and policymakers in the West working on data trusts. In practice, this could mean that decision-making within 
this context could involve elected representatives discussing data preferences at community meetings and 
then communicating them to trustees. 
Outside  of  this  domain,  there  is  significant  progress  being  made  in  indigenous  data  governance  and  
sovereignty, which could inform the design of the data trust’s governance and decision making. Examples of 
indigenous  data  stewardship  across  the  globe  – such  as  the  First  Nations  Information  Governance  Centre  
(FNIGC) in Canada, the Te Mana Raruanga/the Māori Data Sovereignty Network in New Zealand and the 
Global Indigenous Data Alliance – are reference points for how data trusts could be governed
195,
. The CARE 
Principles  for  Indigenous  Data  Governance  provide  a  starting  point  for  indigenous  communities  seeking  to  
build their own data stewardship and governance models, addressing collective benefit, authority to control, 
responsibility and ethics.

4.3.7. Digital infrastructure and technology 
Participants in our co-design phase suggested that qualitative data could be collected through a smartphone 
or desktop app, or voice recording software. Several indigenous communities are already working with data 
collection software such as Mapeo and Global Forest Watch, and organisations working on data collection 
with internally displaced persons have found accessibility to basic technology such as mobile phones and the 
internet to be common.
197
 
A concern presented to us was limited access to technology – such as virtual private clouds – to  securely  
maintain and store the data, and capacity to build and deploy it. One participant described how, in some parts 
of Peru, ‘to have information is super expensive’. 
An area for optimism in this domain was the potential for a data trust to enable access to data at scale sufficient 
to apply natural language processing (NLP). GPAI Responsible AI Working Group’s report on Climate Change 
and  AI  highlighted  the  potential  for  NLP  techniques  to  allow  AI  application  to  qualitative  data  such  as  
interviews.
198
 However, the potential in this context may be limited due to the fact that over 26% of Peru’s 
population do not speak Spanish as a first language, and a majority of those individuals are indigenous.
199
 
This  could  provide  an  opportunity  to  create  a  language  corpus,  as  discussed  in  GPAI  Data  Governance  
Working Group’’s report on the Role of Data in AI
200
, and trustees could choose to donate data to initiatives 
like Common Voice.
201
  
4.3.8. Financial sustainability 
Our participants found it difficult to pinpoint what a critical mass would look like for a data trust in this context. 
However,  due  to  the  qualitative  nature  of  the  data  being  collected,  it  was  suggested  that  the  numbers  of  
interviews would likely be quite low. This could mean that a data trust in this context could require fairly small 
amounts of investment to get started and begin having impact (although storing audio and related data could 
increase costs over time).  
In discussions of potential funding sources, most experts agreed that philanthropic investments were the most 
realistic  route  for  establishing  a  data  trust  in  this  context,  especially  given  that  the  types  of  organisations  
seeking  to  use  data  stewarded  by  the  data  trust  would  include  non-profits –  including  legal  agencies,  
humanitarian organisations, academic and research institutions and environmental advocates. However, this 
funding route would need to be approached with caution to ensure that it didn’t jeopardise the integrity of the 
trust (such as by influencing the decisions made by trustees).

4.4. Assessing the Feasibility of Data Trusts for These Domains  
Based on the information generated through our co-design phase and documented in this section, we assess 
the feasibility of data trusts for the three domains as follows: 
Criteria 
A data trust for 
cycling in London  
A data trust for small 
shareholder farming 
in India 
A data trust for 
indigenous climate 
migration in Peru 
1. Is there an 
incentive for the 
community to come 
together to create  
a data trust? 
+ There is demand  
for improved cycling 
infrastructure among 
the London cycling 
community and 
coalescing around  
a data trust has the 
potential to advocate 
for and impact that. 
-  We could not identify  
a clear incentive for 
small shareholder 
farmers in India to come 
together to form a data 
trust, especially in the 
context of other pressing 
challenges and priorities.  
+ There is demand  
for increased control 
and use of data by 
indigenous communities 
in Peru for a number  
of different purposes, 
including to advocate 
for increased land 
rights. 
2. Do members  
of the community 
have the capacity  
to engage in the 
development and 
running of a data 
trust? 
+ Londoners generally 
have a high level  
of digital literacy,  
and some cyclists are 
already generating 
and using mobility 
data through mobile 
apps and other 
services (although 
levels of capability will 
not be uniform and 
may vary by area  
of London). 
-  There is a distinct  
lack of digital literacy  
in the Indian farmer 
community, and limited 
internet connectivity  
also poses a significant 
challenge to data 
collection, sharing  
and use. 
± There is growing use 
of data by indingenous 
communities in Peru, 
however specific 
indigenous nations  
and communities may 
have lower levels of 
digital literacy.  
3. Is there a person, 
group or organisation 
who can credibly 
drive the 
development of  
a data trust with  
the community? 
± We encountered 
organisations keen  
to support the 
development of a data 
trust to help improve 
cycling infrastructure, 
including Transport  
for London and the 
London Cycling 
Campaign). 
± In theory,  
community-level farmer 
organisations and civil 
society organisations 
could take up the task  
of working with farmers 
to take the idea forward.  
+ There are 
organisations with 
experience in  
data collection  
and indigenous 
representation that 
could take the lead on 
building (and potentially 
hosting/ operating)  
a data trust. 

Enabling Data Sharing for Social Benefit Through Data Trusts: Data Trusts in Climate 
48 
 
4. Is there demand 
for the data among 
prospective users, 
with clearly bound 
use cases for it? 
+ There is high 
demand for mobility 
data from those 
undertaking modelling 
and making decisions 
about London’s 
cycling infrastructure, 
as well as startups, 
advocacy 
organisations  
and academia. 
± There is some  
demand for more local 
farming data from 
research institutions  
and AgTech firms, 
including to develop 
tailored advisories and to 
support AI development.  
-  There is some 
demand from civil 
society organisations 
seeking to use the data 
to better understand 
migration patterns,  
and from indigneous 
communities 
themselves (but  
limited in the context  
of developing/ 
deploying AI).  
5. Are there  
data rights in the 
jurisdiction that 
individuals from the 
community could 
delegate to the  
data trust? 
± The UK GDPR 
recognises individual 
rights over data, but it 
remains to be proven 
whether those rights 
can be delegated to  
a data trust. 
-  There is no data 
protection legislation  
in India and therefore  
no rights that could be 
delegated to a data trust, 
and limited guardrails  
to experiment safely  
with this form of  
data stewardship. 
-  The current legislation 
regarding data rights 
and transfer is not 
substantial or clear 
enough to confidently 
support the transfer  
of rights.  
6. Are there legal 
instruments in the 
jurisdiction that could 
be used to construct 
a data trust and 
establish fiduciary 
obligations to the 
community? 
+ There are a number 
of organisational 
forms that could be 
used to construct the 
data trust such as the 
Company Limited by 
Guarantee, and the 
use of ‘true’ legal 
trusts could also  
be tested. 
± While legal trusts  
in India are not suitable 
as a legal structure for 
data trusts, other 
organisational structures 
such as registered 
societies could provide  
a suitable basis to set up 
a data trust. 
± Trust law exists in 
Peru, however it is 
unclear if this could be 
applied to construct  
a data trust. 
7. Is it 
technologically 
possible for the  
data trust to exert 
control over the  
data it would be 
responsible for? 
+ A mobile app could 
be used to collect 
GPS and motion data, 
similar to the way that 
other mobility services 
function (and porting 
data from other 
services/apps could 
also be possible). 
± Tools like SurveyCTO 
to enable offline 
collection of data in 
areas of low internet 
connectivity, although 
interoperability driven by 
a lack of common data 
standards could inhibit 
efforts to aggregate and 
make use of the data.  
± The qualitative data 
could be collected 
through a smartphone 
app or voice recording 
software, although 
access to virtual private 
clouds to securely 
maintain and store the 
data may be a barrier.

8. Is there access  
to sufficient funding 
to set up the data 
trust, and options to 
ensure its continued 
sustainability? 
± Options for funding 
include philanthropic 
funders interested in 
community initiatives 
and/or data 
stewardship, and  
a data trust could 
experiment with 
different revenue 
models if it needed  
to sustain itself. 
-  We struggled to identify 
potential funding sources 
for a data trust, 
especially given that 
funding for data 
initiatives in agriculture  
in India is limited in 
general. 
± Philanthropic funding 
could be a route for 
establishing a data trust 
in this context, although 
it’s unclear whether 
there would be ways for 
it to become self-
sustaining. 
 
We came to the conclusion that applying the London Cyclist Data Trust would be the most feasible – largely 
on  the  basis  of  there  being  a  clear  incentive  for  the  community  of  cyclists  to  engage,  high  levels  of  digital  
capacity in the community, an ecosystem of credible organisations interested in supporting its development, 
and clear uses for the data it would seek to bring together.

5. A Roadmap for Operationalising a Climate Data Trust 
This roadmap is based on our design of the London Cycling Data Trust, but could be used to take forward a 
similar  data  trust  in  other  locations
202
.  It  is  not  exhaustive,  but  we  hope  it  serves  as  a  useful  reference  for  
practitioners seeking to implement a climate data trust. 
It is intended to be undertaken by a person or organisation who can credibly drive the development of the 
data trust with the given community (for example, in the context of the London Data Trust this could be the 
London Cycling Campaign), with sufficient funding. 
While the steps are highly interrelated, we set them out across five streams: 
 
Figure 8: Five streams to operationalise a data trust 
Community: 
•   Conduct extensive engagement and user research with the cyclist community to develop  
a detailed understanding of their expectations and needs from the data trust. 
•   Evaluate and adjust for the variation in capacity and levels of engagement within the citizen group 
(for instance – how do the concerns and interests differ by gender, ethnicity or location?). 
•   Engage with prospective data users to understand the potential use cases and the data needed  
to undertake them, as well as the technological means of access they require. 
•   Consider how value and impact will be communicated back to the community as a result  
of the data collection and use (for instance, communicating when cycle lanes have been  
built or improved). 
•   Develop mechanisms for ongoing participation and decision making with the cyclist group 
regarding the overall nature and direction of the data trust.

https://datatrusts.uk/blogs/creating-a-  pathway-to-successful-real-world-data-trusts. 

Enabling Data Sharing for Social Benefit Through Data Trusts: Data Trusts in Climate 
51 
 
Capacity: 
•   Identify and recruit for (or engage delivery partners with) the different skills required to set up and 
run the data trust, such as those with specialist knowledge and experience in compliance, 
operations, finance, technology, design, data stewardship and community engagement. 
•   Identify and recruit trustees, considering the diversity and balance of perspectives and interests to 
be represented to ensure responsible data stewardship.  
 
Legal and governance: 
•   Further evaluate the potential legal forms the data trust could take, such as a legal trust  
or company limited by guarantee. Consider whether an existing organisation could host/take  
on the role of the data trust. 
•   Consider how the fiduciary responsibilities of the trustees can be made contextual and explicit,  
and sufficient in safeguarding the interests of the cyclists. 
•   Undertake appropriate privacy impact assessments, as well as consider the ethical implications  
of the data trust’s activities (for example, using tools like the ODI Data Ethics Canvas
203
  
or Consequence Scanning
204
). 
•   Design a detailed set of terms for how the data trust will make different types of decisions  
(for example, granular decisions about which third parties can access the data it stewards,  
as well as strategic decisions about the revenue models it might need to adopt). 
•   Address the question of whether and how the delegation of data rights is possible (for example,  
in the context of the London Data Trust, if UK GDPR permits cyclists to delegate rights  
to the data trust).  
•   Develop legal agreements to use to constrain third parties’ use of the data, and means  
of enforcement and redress.  
•   Register/incorporate the chosen legal form (for example, by registering the company limited  
by guarantee with Companies House and completing statutory documentation).

Technology: 
•   Develop, test and refine prototypes of the data trust’s interface (in the case of the London  
Data Trust, building on the initial wireframes for the Positive Cycling app). 
•   Build back-end systems to securely ingress, host and combine data, if required.  
•   Build appropriate mechanisms to enable third parties, as deemed appropriate by trustees,  
to access the data (for example, using Trusted Research Environments or deploying Privacy 
Enhancing Technologies to restrict access). Consider means of auditing and enforcement to 
ensure data use are in line with the preferences of the community and as agreed by trustees. 
•   Explore different technological functions the data trust could itself take on, such as undertaking 
analysis or developing data visualisations. 
 
Scale and sustainability: 
•   Identify (and if required, implement) approaches to generating revenue, such as charging  
some users for access to data. 
•   Undertake a campaign to make cyclists aware of the data trust and encourage them to get 
involved (for instance, in the case of the London Cycle Data Trust, to launch and advertise  
the Positive Cycle mobile app). 
•   Begin to consider options for scaling the data trusts, such as by increasing its geographical 
coverage or ability to responsibly steward other data types.

6. Conclusion 
In the course of this research, we have identified several themes and reached conclusions about data trusts 
as a form of data stewardship: 
1. On the feasibility and next steps for the three climate domains: 
We’re  optimistic  about  the  potential  for  a  London  Cycle  Data  Trust  and  other,  similar  data  trusts  to  
emerge  to  enable  communities  to  use  data  to  advocate  for,  and  inform  the  design  of,  sustainable  
transport  infrastructure.  Existing  initiatives  such  as  Posmo.Coop  and  the  Bike  Data  Project  show  that  
there  is  interest  and  motivation  among  communities  and  that  there  are  defined  uses  for  data  in  this  
context, as well as momentum behind the idea.  
While  the  feasibility  of  data  trusts  for  small  shareholder  farming  in  India  or  for  indigenous  climate  
migration in Peru is less certain, there are clearly opportunities to improve how data is collected, used 
and shared in these areas and we hope this work serves to highlight them. 
2. On the process of co-designing data trusts: 
We set out to involve diverse groups of stakeholders in the co-design of the three data trusts. We were 
able to include participants with different perspectives and interests, and from different parts of the world. 
We  hope  that  the  combination  of  research  and  design  methods  we’ve  used  will  help  to  move  the  
discussion of data trusts from the theory (with the common placeholder of ‘it depends’) to a more specific 
discussion, anchored in tangible descriptions of how they could look and function in practice. 
However, we're aware of the limitations of this co-design process. Given the timescale of the project,  
we used desk research and expert interviews to select the domains, rather than an open call. We did  
not  pursue  direct  communication  with  London  cyclists  and  displaced  indigenous  communities  in  this  
project, and had limited exposure to smaller shareholder farmers in India. Therefore the three designs 
are  based  on  the  needs  of  these  communities  as  documented  in  literature  or  as  understood   
by stakeholders who work closely with them. We recommend that practitioners exploring data trusts in 
these  domains  –  and in  general,  researching  or  designing  data  trusts  –  consider  more  participatory  
approaches over a longer period. 
3. On the general feasibility of data trusts: 
Data  trusts  differ  from  other  approaches  to  bottom-up  data  stewardship  by  having  a)  independent  
trustees with b) explicit, contextual fiduciary obligations. We feel the significant discourse around possible 
legal instruments to apply these functions can distract from other important conditions necessary for data 
trusts  to  emerge.  As  our  feasibility  criteria  describe,  a  clear  incentive  for  a  community  to  mobilise,  
capacity for them to do so and appropriate leadership are vital.  
We’re conscious that the concept of data trusts can sometimes become detached from existing bottom-
up  data  stewardship  initiatives,  such  as  those  we  list  in  Section  2.  Their  existence  shows  that  
communities can be empowered around their data without the need for trustees with this particular type 
of duty. Therefore these functions are not only difficult to fulfil, but the need for them also remains to be 
proven. To do so, we perhaps not only require a real-world data trust to provide a comparison, but also 
for  that  data  trust  and  a  similar  initiative  to  ‘go  wrong’  to  then  be  able  to  analyse  the  comparative  
outcomes (and validate that having trustees with fiduciary obligations provides increased protections).

54 
 
This  may  be  a  long  way  off,  potentially  enabling  data  trusts  to  exist  as  a  rich  theoretical  debate  that  
detracts from the pragmatic and impactful work of real-world initiatives.     
4. On other approaches to responsible data stewardship for AI: 
Experimentation  around  data  trusts  and  other  forms  of  bottom-up  data  stewardship  is  important.  
However, data can be stewarded responsibly without requiring this level of individual control, which will 
not work for everyone. In general, as with this research, we are still exploring the contexts where these 
approaches to data are viable and useful. 
Even where they are, such as in the case of the London Cycle Data Trust, data trusts are likely to grow 
slowly,  and  the  collective  dataset  the  cycling  community  creates  may  not  ever  meet  AI  practitioners'  
needs for data at scale. For policymakers and other actors interested in data stewardship as a means of 
supporting  the  development  and  application  of  AI,  we  recommend  considering  other  approaches  
alongside  data  trusts.  For  example:  platforms  that  enable  people  to  donate  data  to  create  new  data  
assets  at  scale  (see  Mozilla’s  Common  Voice
205
);  hubs  that  provide  infrastructure  that  enable  
organisations  to  come  together  to  share  data  with  researchers  securely  (see  INSIGHT  Health  Data  
Research Hub
206
); or organisations publishing data that can be used to train AI models (see Waymo’s 
autonomous vehicles sensor data
207
). 
5. On the role for GPAI and other policymakers: 
We  appreciate  GPAI’s  commitment  to  exploring  new  forms  of  data  stewardship.  Based  on  our  
experiences with this research, we recommend that the GPAI Data Governance Working Group: 
•   undertakes work to imagine (and assess the feasibility of) other new forms of data stewardship,  
to inspire data governance practitioners and demonstrate the array of options open to them.  
•   documents initiatives that already steward data responsibly for AI development and application,  
to amplify best practices and bridge the gap between forward-looking research and the real world. 
•   provides access to long-term funding and other resources, to enable practitioners to attempt to 
implement data trusts (such as the London Cycle Data Trust) and other forms of data stewardship. 
Other policymakers helping to advance the understanding and practice of responsible data governance 
may also consider these proposed next steps.

Methodology 
Selecting Climate Domains to Focus on 
In  October  2021,  we  initiated  this  research  which  aimed  to  assess  the  feasibility  of  data  trusts  for  climate  
action.  We  undertook  a  review  of  climate  literature  and  conducted    interviews  with  experts  to  deepen  our  
understanding of the field and generate a longlist of climate challenges to start from. 
The  literature  review  examined  scientific  and  grey  literature.  The  goal  of  the  review  was  to  gain  a  broad  
understanding  of  the  key  issues  in  climate  change,  and  how  data  and  AI  were  being  deployed  to  address  
them.  We  undertook  17  interviews  with  experts  in  this  phase  to  supplement  our  review,  with  interviewees  
selected for their expertise in the areas of data stewardship, climate, data science and analysis, and artificial 
intelligence.  The  research  team  created  topic  guides  to  steer  the  interviews,  and  each  interview  lasted  
between 45 minutes and one hour. 
Following this initial process, we generated the following, non-exhaustive longlist of climate challenges: city 
mobility; energy use; agriculture; community resilience; climate  migration; water use; wildlife conservation; 
and air quality. 
Rather than focusing on one challenge or trying to design one general-purpose climate data trust to tackle all 
challenges,  we  chose  to  narrow  down  to  three  domains.  Using  domains  as  case  studies  was  intended  to  
increase the likelihood of a data trust ultimately being built (that is, to ‘spread our bets’), as well as broaden 
the range of things we would learn about data trusts as an approach to data stewardship. We developed a set 
of four criteria to aid the selection of three domains: 
1. Can data play a critical role in tackling the challenges faced in this domain?  
2. Can data from this domain be used to develop or deploy artificial intelligence? 
3. Are there opportunities in this domain for bottom-up approaches that empower individuals to play 
a role in stewarding data?  
4. Would focusing on this domain help us to explore privacy (and other rights)  
enhancing technologies?  
We  applied  these  criteria  using  RAG (Red-Amber-Green)  ratings,  using  the  information  generated  through  
our co-design process to summarise favourable (Green), neutral (Amber) and unfavourable (Red) values. We 
used the RAG ratings to inform the following decisions: 
To combine the city mobility, water use, energy use and air quality domains under a new  
domain of ‘city sustainability’. This change was made after recognising overlaps between several  
of the associated data types and systems, and the potential to focus the application of a data  
trust within a particular city or urban environment, which came through as a common theme  
in our expert interviews.

56 
 
To narrow the agriculture domain to ‘small shareholder farming’. This choice was made after feedback from 
several stakeholders that the agriculture domain was too broad and that ‘big agriculture’ (encompassing 
large commercial farms owned by corporations ) would offer  
limited opportunities to explore bottom-up data stewardship. 
To select the climate migration domain. Our research suggested that data trusts could represent a powerful 
tool for climate migrants that would ensure the data collected about them was protected and used in their 
interests, which unfortunately isn’t always the case currently.  
We also sought to explore these domains through different geographic and jurisdictional lenses, to assess the 
feasibility of data trusts in diverse socio-economic and legal contexts. The following choices of locations also 
took into account practical considerations, such as the networks developed and prior research conducted by 
the ODI and Aapti Institute: 
Within the city sustainability domain, London was chosen as the ODI has a deep understanding of and 
connections with the data ecosystem. Additionally, prior research conducted by Aapti Institute showed that 
trusts' institutional and legal origins in England and Wales make them the most suitable for instantiating data 
trusts through trust law.
208
  
Within the small shareholder farming domain, India was chosen due to Aapti Institute’s prior experience in 
evaluating the impact of data governance policies on the agriculture sector in  
India
209
. This choice was also aided by India's legal system having a well documented and robust 
jurisprudence of various legal structures – such as trusts, societies, and companies – which could be 
leveraged to set up a data trust. 
Within the climate migration domain, Peru was chosen because of its geographical location, climate and 
environment, which make it extremely susceptible to climate migration. Furthermore, while both the UK and 
India have common law systems, Peru provided us with the opportunity to explore legal structures for data 
trusts in a civil law jurisdiction. 
At  the  end  of  October  2021,  GPAI’s  Data  Governance  Working  Group  confirmed  the  domains  and  their  
geographical   locations:   city   sustainability   (London);   small   shareholder   farming   (India);   and   climate    
migration (Peru).

Co-designing Data Trusts 
Between November 2021 and February 2022, we used co-design methods to understand and articulate what 
a data trust for each of the three domains could look like. The purpose of using a co-design methodology was 
to discover unique and varied perspectives, in recognition of the need to explore and develop participatory 
data  stewardship  initiatives  in  a  collaborative  way.  As  part  of  the  process,  we  drew  from  frameworks  for  
developing data trusts provided by Aapti Institute and Data Trusts Initiative.
210
 
We convened three sets of co-design participants, one for each domain. This included expert interviewees 
from our previous phase; respondents to our open call for participation
211
; and people and organisations we 
had encountered in our research or who had been referred to us.  
We sought to balance domain expertise – those with an understanding of that climate area, such as its causes, 
challenges,  main  actors  and  current  blockers  to data  collection,  use  or  sharing  –  with  expertise  in  data  
stewardship – those  with  knowledge  of  data  trusts  and  other  approaches  to  bottom-up  data  stewardship;  
hands-on experience in building technological systems to store data or using data to generate insights; or an 
interest  in  the  use  of  different  legal  frameworks  to  underpin  data  stewardship.  The  full  list  of  co-design 
participants for each domain can be found in the Acknowledgements appendix. 
To facilitate the discussion and input of our co-design participants, we set up a series of design templates on 
Miro,  a  digital  whiteboard  software.  This  structure  was  used  in  both  of  the  co-design  workshops  and  
participants were also able to contribute to the whiteboard independently. We used a variety of templates and 
design techniques within the Miro boards, including stakeholder mapping, logic modelling and data ecosystem 
mapping. The Miro boards – for city sustainability
212
, small shareholder farming
213
 and climate migration
214
 – 
remain open for further contribution. 
We undertook three main methods of co-design during this process: 
Workshops. Workshops were held online at the end of January 2022 – one for each domain –  
and ran for two hours with an average of 12 stakeholders participating. These workshops used  
the Miro boards and curated design frameworks. The agenda for the workshops was tailored to each 
domain but broadly covered activities to improve stakeholders’ understanding; identify the potential 
problems that a data trust could address; and design how it could function. These workshops also 
highlighted potential issues and barriers to the development of such a data trust. We also used  
Aapti’s Stewardship Mapper
215
 and Stewardship Navigator
216
, and guidance and other materials  
from the Data Trusts Initiative, to brief, provide context and set some parameters for our participants.

1:1 design sessions. Following the co-design workshops, we followed up with workshop attendees  
to undertake individual discussions and co-design sessions using Miro. These sessions were recorded  
and analysed using thematic coding. 
Independent work. The team also undertook independent research and design work. We engaged  
a member of the ODI’s technology team to explore the high-level data architectures for data trusts;  
and a member of Aapti Institute’s team with legal expertise, who considered the appropriate legal  
forms for each of the developing designs. 
As a bottom-up form of data stewardship, data trusts should interact with the individuals from the community 
whose  data  they  are  to  steward.  This  interactive  component  of  data  trusts  is  often  overlooked  in  favour  of  
discussion of their potential legal, technological or governance aspects. We sought to design what the user 
journeys and interfaces could look like for the data trusts, so worked with specialist user interface designers. 
For the city sustainability domain we developed speculative designs for a smartphone app that would interact 
with cyclists; whereas for small shareholder farming and climate migration we developed storyboards showing 
how communities could engage with a data trust. 
This process produced designs for a hypothetical data trust in each domain. Ultimately, each is the product of 
different design choices, inspired by our interactions with participants and our research. 
Developing and Applying the Feasibility Criteria 
We had originally set out to first undertake the co-design of the data trusts, and then develop and apply criteria 
to  assess  their  feasibility.  In  practice,  this  was  a  more  iterative  process  whereby  we  learned  about  the  
elements of feasibility as we engaged with the domains and their co-design participants. For example, the 
need for a strong financial, reciprocal or altruistic incentive for a community to come together around a data 
trust became apparent as we learned about the reasons for individuals taking part in parallel city sustainability 
initiatives like Posmo Coop. 
We therefore developed the feasibility criteria through the co-design process, and in February 2022, made 
conclusions about each domain’s feasibility described in Section 4.4 . We applied the criteria using RAG (Red-
Amber-Green)  ratings,  using  the  information  generated  through  our  co-design  process  to  summarise  
favourable  (Green),  neutral  (Amber)  and  unfavourable  (Red)  values.  Our  assessment  of  each  domain’s  
feasibility was then confirmed by GPAI at a red-teaming session
217
. This methodology could be adopted by 
similar projects wishing to explore the application of data trusts in a given context; in other, longer projects, 
each criteria could be the subject of extensive study.

Technology, and organised in collaboration with the University of Birmingham. Supported by a donation from 
the  Patrick  J  McGovern  Foundation,  the  Data  Trusts  Initiative  funds  research  and  engagement  activities   
at  the  interface  of  technology,  policy  and  the  law,  and  seeks  to  shift  discussions  about  data  trusts  from   
principle to practice.  
The Gl   obal Partnership on Artificial Intelligence (GPAI) is a multi-stakeholder initiative which aims to bridge 
the gap between theory and practice on AI by supporting cutting-edge research and applied activities on AI-
related priorities. Built around a shared commitment to the OECD Recommendation on Artificial Intelligence, 
GPAI  brings  together  engaged  minds  and  expertise  from  science,  industry,  civil  society,  governments,  
international organisations and academia to foster international cooperation.
