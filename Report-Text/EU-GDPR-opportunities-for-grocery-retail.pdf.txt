A note on language: we don’t ‘own’ data 
Personal data might reflect more than just one person or 
organisation. This is why we do not refer to ‘people’s personal 
data’ but instead use ‘personal data about them’.  
Multiple people can have rights over, and responsibilities for, 
data. A simple shopping list can be used to guess things about 
multiple members of a household, for example. Multiple people 
and organisations might have intellectual property rights due to 
their contributions to the data. By avoiding possessive pronouns 
we hope to encourage understanding of the wider network of 
relationships involved in data collection and use.

Redefining the data landscape for retail
The arrival of General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) 
 
to the EU in May 2018 has the potential to shift the balance  
of power between retailers and their customers. It brings  
both challenges and opportunities to organisations that  
wish to compete and win in the new era of data-driven retail. 
With many retailers viewing the incoming legislation simply  
as a compliance issue, there has been surprisingly little 
dialogue around the positives these changes could bring to 
the retail industry. The chance to deepen relationships with 
consumers, through an open, honest and equitable approach 
to how data is used and shared, could be the catalyst for 
innovation in the industry – driving growth for business and 
improving the daily lives of consumers.
To fully understand how retailers, brands and consumers 
might respond to this new data landscape, we have 
supported the ODI to undertake independent, wide-ranging 
industry research to explore how the incoming changes are 
being viewed. Understanding how behaviours might change 
in the post-GDPR world – and what that really means for 
retailers and brands – is key to ensuring the industry remains 
at the forefront of data-driven development.
A brave new world of data-driven retail is emerging – one in 
which retailers will create new relationships and experiences 
with customers, and new ways to achieve business growth. 
With the arrival of legislation such as GDPR, the time to seize 
these opportunities is now.

The UK retail sector

Open Data Institute 2017 / Whitepaper The EU General Data Protection Regulation: opportunities for grocery retail 7
New laws requiring more openness and transparency will change 
how organisations collect and use personal data, and give shoppers 
more control over how data about them is used. The European Union 
General Data Protection Regulation presents a significant opportunity 
for the UK grocery retail sector. By proactively informing shoppers 
about their data rights and how data-driven services benefit them, 
organisations can build trust and strengthen loyalty, which will create 
greater buy-in from shoppers for data-enabled innovation.
 Executive  summary
Every shopping trip generates 
data that can be used by 
retailers. This can be about 
people’s shopping habits, 
preferred brands or interest  
in promotions.
 
By analysing data alone or together with third parties, retailers 
inform the entire shopping experience, from how to lay out 
stores and what products to stock, to what promotions to run 
and what offers to give customers. Among others, price-
matching schemes and new delivery services are increasingly 
being developed using this data. These services can offer 
benefits to shoppers, helping people save time and money.
However, the UK retail sector must be vigilant in responding 
to changes in the data landscape. Our research found that 
while shoppers trust retailers with data more than technology 
companies, they were still uncomfortable with how retailers 
shared personal data.
In response to this discomfort, the UK is implementing the 
General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) to give citizens 
more rights and control over personal data. This creates 
compliance needs but also new ways of engaging shoppers 
around data. 
Our research tested some business models and found 
interest from significant numbers of shoppers. However, our 
interviews with industry showed obstacles to seizing this 
opportunity, including cultural and commercial barriers that 
stop businesses innovating and sharing data in ways that 
shoppers want.
Recommendations for retailers and the 
grocery retail sector
 
Build trust by communicating with shoppers:
 Run a data literacy campaign for consumers, to build 
awareness of data use within retail
   Focus on building informed consent and helping shoppers 
understand the benefits created by data sharing
 
Create a foundation for data-enabled innovation: 
 Open up common reference data, such as products 
 
and retail locations
 Develop open standards to facilitate data exchange 
 Create open APIs to reduce cost and friction when 
shoppers request to access and share data
 
Create a strategic programme for the UK grocery  
retail sector:
   Form a cross-sector strategic working group on retail 
 
data to enable a collaborative response to challenges 
raised by GDPR 
 Create and implement principles around data governance 
and usage for grocery retail

CROSS-SECTOR 
WORKING GROUP

Open Data Institute 2017 / Whitepaper The EU General Data Protection Regulation: opportunities for grocery retail 8
Every shopping trip  
generates data that can  
be used by retailers. 
 
This data can be about people’s shopping habits, their 
preferred brands or their interest in promotions. It is ‘personal 
data’ because it can be linked to an identifiable individual, 
often through a loyalty card programme. Retailers also collect 
and use information about products, supply chains and 
stores. This data flows between multiple organisations in 
 
the sector.
What data does the sector collect? 
Data is collected from four primary streams, three of which 
may contain personal data:
[1]
 Data actively provided by shoppers, such as their 
contact information, when they register an online account 
or sign up for a loyalty card.
 Data collected from shoppers’ activities online and 
in-store, such as what they buy and what card is used.  
For shoppers with loyalty cards like Nectar or Tesco 
Clubcard, this information is tied to the card’s unique 
identifier in the retailer’s system. 
 Data inferred or predicted about shoppers’ lifestyles, 
households and food needs. This may include publicly 
available statistics and data collected by third-party 
aggregators about overall market trends, or statistical 
models that use past behaviour to predict future behaviour. 
 Reference data that supermarkets collect about their 
resources and outputs, such as store size, location and 
revenue, product information like pack size, price or 
nutritional content, and information concerning their 
 
supply chains and environmental impact. 
How does the sector use data? 
Once personal data is collected, it is analysed by retailers  
or specialist third parties. Data analysis helps retailers  
inform the entire shopping experience, from how to lay out  
the store and what products to stock to what promotions  
to run and what offers to give customers. Data is usually  
used at an anonymised and aggregated level, except for 
targeting communications where customers receive 
personalised offers.
Third parties such as payment networks perform vital 
functions in the transaction process and also collect and 
 
use data. Providers like Visa receive data about transaction 
values and merchant names, which enables them to provide 
better merchant services. Other third parties are the data 
analytics providers and aggregators – notably dunnhumby, 
IRI and Nielsen – who may receive loyalty-card or till-
transaction data, which is turned into aggregated customer, 
retailer or market insight. These companies help retailers 
make sense of large quantities of data in order to respond  
to customer needs and market trends. 
Fast Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) often have very  
little customer data, since they do not usually sell direct to 
consumers. Companies such as Unilever and Procter & 
Gamble will often buy insights built from aggregated data  
to better understand their shoppers’ behaviour and profiles, 
and use this data to drive marketing or product development.
How is data creating value for the sector? 
The use of personal data is creating value for shoppers, 
retailers and shareholders in the sector. 
For shoppers, data is traditionally used to shape the entire 
shopping trip. Increasingly, new services such as price-
matching schemes or new payment or delivery services are 
developed, tested and measured using shopping data. 
 
These services can offer benefits to shoppers, helping people 
save time and money.
Using data well and creating a better experience for shoppers 
results in increased visits. This drives sales and market share, 
delivering value for shareholders.

2 Quantitative survey of 1970 people conducted by Britain Thinks  
for the ODI, August 2017
3   The European Commission’s proposed ePrivacy law will also affect data 
collection and use. The content of this law, how it interacts with GDPR,  
and when, how, or if it will be implemented in the UK is not yet clear 
With organisations increasingly 
relying on data collection  
and use to drive value in UK  
grocery retail, the sector must 
be vigilant in responding to 
changes in the data landscape. 
 
How shoppers feel about the collection  
and use of personal data
Shoppers’ comfort around data practices varies.  
Our research (explained in the Methodology section) found 
roughly one-third valued data-enabled services and 23%  
felt uncomfortable with current data practices across 
sectors. This discomfort is linked to feeling ‘out of control’ 
and uninformed of how data about them is used and shared. 
Shoppers feel uncomfortable about sharing personal 
data with third parties 
Among those surveyed, 62% felt uncomfortable with third-
party organisations having access to personal data about 
them, and nearly all of the 23% of shoppers uncomfortable 
with current data practices were also uncomfortable sharing 
data with third parties. Many shoppers felt unable to control 
which organisations could use data about them and for  
what. 43% were concerned that third-party organisations 
may compromise their privacy. 
 ‘It’s all about choice. I didn’t choose for them 
to have access to my data.’ 
— Early adopter, 36–60, Manchester 
Shoppers felt happier sharing data with identified third parties 
when they were actively choosing to share this data.  
Shoppers trust grocery retail about as much as 
government, but considerably more than technology 
companies 
Food retailers are about as trusted as government when  
it comes to collecting data.
[

] 
Roughly one-third are 
comfortable, one-third uncomfortable and one-third are 
neutral. However, retailers are significantly more trusted than 
social media and technology companies. Only 13% of 
shoppers are comfortable, with 60% actively uncomfortable. 
Shoppers’ trust varies on the type of data collected
Shoppers’ comfort levels varied depending on the type of 
data collected. Almost three quarters felt comfortable with 
supermarkets holding data on their grocery shopping habits, 
while over half felt comfortable with food retailers holding 
data often considered sensitive, such as marital status and 
ethnicity. However, only 15% of shoppers were comfortable 
with retailers holding their internet browser history.
Among those who felt generally uncomfortable with current 
data practices, that fell to 4%.
The new European Union General Data Protection Regulation 
(GDPR) law reflects – and intends to address – the wider 
feeling of concern around current data practices, in retail  
and other sectors.
 
 ‘ GDPR is an opportunity to start having 
conversations with customers to build trust.’
— Head of Data Governance, major retailer 
How new laws can empower shoppers 
New laws are being applied across the European Union that 
will change the way retailers collect, protect and use data 
about shoppers, by giving people more control over data 
about them.
[
3
]
GDPR will apply in all current EU countries, including the  
UK, from May 2018. It strengthens the rights of individuals to 
access data that is held about them, move data from one 
organisation to another, and delete data about them. The UK 
is bringing in a new Data Protection Bill, released in draft in 
September 2017, which will implement GDPR rights. The law 
will impact how the grocery retail sector collects, uses and 
holds data to provide services. The race to ensure compliance 
by 2018 has brought the issue of personal data up the list of 
priorities for many supermarkets and third parties.

GDPR expands the definition of personal data to include IP 
addresses. The Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO), 
responsible for monitoring and enforcing compliance with 
data-protection laws in the UK, states that the expansion 
‘reflect[s] changes in technology and the way organisations 
collect information about people’.
[

]
 
The potential regulatory fines under GDPR are huge, with 
businesses liable for up to 4% of their total annual global 
turnover or (if higher) €20 million. However, as the ICO says: 
‘thinking that GDPR is about crippling financial punishment 
misses the point [...] it’s about putting the consumer and 
citizen first’.
[
5
]
  
How will GDPR affect the sector? 
GDPR specifies that data controllers – namely organisations 
who control the ‘purposes and means’ of processing 
personal data – are primarily responsible for ensuring 
compliance with data protection laws. Supermarket retailers 
are generally data controllers, but other organisations 
handling data about shoppers, such as data aggregators, 
could also be considered controllers.
GDPR introduces new accountability requirements that will 
affect how controllers handle and process data about 
shoppers. Data controllers must implement the principles of 
data protection by design and by default into their processes, 
including minimising the data they collect, ensuring good 
governance regarding personal data processing and 
providing evidence of compliance. In situations deemed 
high-risk, data controllers must carry out Data Protection 
Impact Assessments (DPIAs).
 
 ‘ It is all about strengthening trust and updating 
the law to the 21st century.’ 
 — Garreth Cameron, Policy and Engagement  
Group Manager, ICO 
Data controllers may use third-party processors to help 
process personal data, including organisations who provide 
data storage or analytics services, such as Amazon Web 
Services, Experian, dunnhumby and Nielsen. For the first 
time, processors will have direct data-protection

RightDescription
Did it exist 
already?
What are its key changes  
and elements?
The right to be 
informed
Organisations must provide 
individuals with ‘fair processing 
information’ about the use of 
personal data about them, primarily 
through privacy notices.
Ye sThe information provided must be 
concise, transparent and written in 
clear and plain language.
The right of access 
(subject access right)
Grants individuals access to data 
that an organisation holds about 
them.
Ye sA £10 charge has been removed: 
information must be provided free 
of charge for the first copy, unless 
the request is ‘manifestly 
unfounded’ or repetitive. The data 
must be provided without undue 
delay, generally within one month 
after receiving the request for data. 
The right to data 
portability
Allows an individual to obtain a 
copy of personal data for reuse 
across other services.
NoThis is a new right under GDPR. 
It will only apply in specific 
situations where data was 
processed automatically, and 
the justification for processing 
the data was that the individual 
had consented to that use, such 
as loyalty-card data.

responsibilities and liabilities.
GDPR creates new rights and strengthens others that already 
exist under the Data Protection Act.
[
6
]
The views of relevant regulators, like the ICO will be important 
in working out how to apply the new law. 
Shoppers welcome these changes 
Despite initially not knowing much about data protection  
laws, when given information about GDPR, many shoppers 
supported its principles. 
   ‘It gives you more control over your data.’ 
 — Mainstream consumer, from a rural area 
Many of the shoppers we surveyed felt that GDPR would 
address their concerns by forcing companies to make 
information about how data is collected, used and shared 
easier to understand. Changes that would give individuals 
more power to control data about them were well-received, 
with 45% saying they were likely to use their right to data 
access, and 25% their right to data portability. 
How changes could present challenges  
for the sector 
Discomfort among shoppers with current data practices  
and the introduction of GDPR may present challenges for  
the sector. 
People exercising their data rights will incur  
costs to retailers
With 45% of shoppers stating that they would like to make 
use of their new right to access data under GDPR, the sector 
must equip itself to handle these requests efficiently and 
effectively.
Consumer campaigns and businesses that provide services 
built on these new data rights may create even more demand 
from shoppers for access to data about them. Retailers will 
have to bear both the costs of servicing these requests and 
the reputational impact if they fail to do so quickly and well. 
 
Lack of data literacy fuels distrust in the sector
Our research showed that shoppers who understood less 
about how data is used were more uncomfortable with how 
organisations might use it. A lack of knowledge about third 
parties and a lack of understanding about what they do with 
information both worried 17% of shoppers. Retailers who are 
unable to clearly articulate how they use personal data risk 
losing shoppers to a competitor perceived to be more 
trustworthy. There is also a risk that the sector as a whole will 
gain a bad reputation for handling data, resulting in shoppers 
withdrawing consent from retailers to use it. 
Scepticism delaying innovation in the sector
Low shopper awareness around data rights has led some 
organisations to be sceptical about the opportunities that 
GDPR presents for innovation. 
During interviews with the ODI, some industry leaders 
expressed skepticism, seeing greater opportunities for 
innovation in sectors such as telecoms and insurance.
This represents a general feeling across sectors, with only 9% 
of professionals expecting GDPR to impact profitability.
[
7
]
 
Many in grocery retail were still focused on compliance and 
had yet to turn their attention to the possibilities for innovation. 
Although one supermarket told the ODI they were exploring 
opportunities for creating standards to port data, generally 
organisations were focused on refining their internal data 
processes to avoid fines. 
 ‘[ The retail sector] all monitor prices on a real-time 
basis. The biggest advantage [for shoppers] will  
be arbitrage – can you buy the same for less 
elsewhere?’
— Data Lead, major retailer 
This scepticism may be self-fulfilling, with those organisations 
missing out on potential opportunities and delaying 
innovation, while companies who have better data capabilities 
– and are open to building new services for the 45% 
 
of shoppers who want to use these new rights – grab the 
advantage. 
Organisations struggling to modernise and  
innovate using data 
The opportunities of GDPR may be missed by organisations 
who lack resources or decide not to invest in data, in favour  
of other priorities. 
Without action, the disparity between ‘bricks and mortar’ 
organisations and those using data and technology to drive 
commercial operations is likely to increase. Organisations risk 
ignoring opportunities for data-enabled products and 
services and losing competitive advantage, as large, agile 
technology companies move to fill that space. Online retailers 
Without strengthening data 
infrastructure and building 
innovative new services, 
organisations risk loss  
of revenue, market share  
and brand reputation

The UK grocery retail sector 
must now consider how to 
confront these challenges  
in order to create a future that 
benefits shoppers,shareholders 
and the wider sector. 
Our research found that shoppers would like to be informed 
of how data about them is collected and used in order  
to give meaningful consent, feel in control of what is done  
with data about them and benefit from sharing that data.  
By addressing shoppers’ concerns and desires for future 
services, the sector can use GDPR as an opportunity to drive 
innovation and value for shoppers and shareholders.  
Building trust with shoppers 
Inform shoppers of how data is collected and used
Our research found that shoppers would like to be more 
informed of how personal data is collected and used in 
grocery retail.
[

]
 GDPR can prompt the sector to evaluate 
whether they are currently meeting shoppers’ needs and 
address those feeling uninformed or disempowered. 
45% of shoppers who were uncomfortable with current data 
practices felt that a service informing them about what data 
companies held about them would be beneficial; this rose to 
57% among shoppers who already felt comfortable. In focus 
groups, shoppers felt more comfortable sharing data when 
they understood a third party’s identity and purpose for using 
personal data.
 
 ‘We want to see confident consumers who 
understand their rights and apply them intelligently, 
and businesses that are open, transparent and fair’
 — Garreth Cameron, Policy and Engagement  
Group Manager, ICO 
A number of retailers the ODI spoke with considered trust to 
be a fundamental part of their brand and business model.  
For these retailers, and for the sector in general, being trusted 
with data is likely to become an essential consideration in the 
New laws and 
opportunities for 
the sector
such as Amazon are using technology and individual shopper 
preferences to provide innovative services, such as  
the Amazon Dash button and Amazon Go shops.  
Without strengthening data infrastructure and building 
innovative new services, organisations risk loss of  
revenue, market share and brand reputation. 
Cultural and commercial barriers exist to opening  
and sharing data 
With the average grocer making 2% profit, thin margins  
mean the sector leans towards a closed and competitive 
culture.

 In this environment, organisations may fear that  
data sharing and collaborating on common problems  
will mean losing competitive advantage and market share.
The ODI saw tendencies towards a closed culture when 
discussing GDPR with the UK grocery retail sector. Many 
industry leaders are focused on ensuring accountability and 
security in the face of large fines. GDPR is seen as a set  
of risks to mitigate, rather than opportunities to collaborate. 
 ‘We are overcoming tensions in changing our  
culture to one of innovation by implementing 
principles and training across the organisation.’
 — Guy Johnson, Head of Corporate BI strategy, 
 
Marks and Spencer 
Without working together, the sector will not be able to 
answer increasingly important questions about common 
issues such as data governance, ethics and infrastructure. 
There will also be benefit for all in collaborating to create 
common product reference data, which does not require 
personal data. When it comes to shopper data, the reality 
is that shoppers will be able to choose who they share data 
with, regardless of any reluctance from the sector to do so. 
While we need to balance investing in sharing data with the 
perceived commercial losses from sharing, not exploring 
these trade-offs will mean that data remains locked inside 
individual organisations, and its full value will not be realised. 
  ‘Those who treat GDPR as just ticking the box 
will have missed an opportunity.’

near future. By giving shoppers more information, the sector 
can ease discomfort and enable shoppers to make more 
informed choices, which may influence both where and how 
consumers choose to shop, and how the sector uses data.
A sector that is open about its data practices will encourage 
data sharing, and build trust that personal data is handled 
ethically and beneficially for shoppers. Organisations such  
as the Co-op have been exploring how this might be achieved 
in future. 
Give shoppers greater control over data about them
Shoppers want to feel in control of how data about them is 
used. Organisations should investigate models that meet this 
need in order to stand out in the market.
Personal Information Management Services (PIMS) present 
one way of increasing individual control. PIMS services like 
mydex, digi.me and Bits About Me aim to increase control  
by storing data in one central locker and mediating access  
by third parties.
[
10
]
 Alternatively, Powr of You provide shoppers 
with a share of the profits made from selling aggregated and 
anonymised data about their browsing and purchase activity. 
There are passionate debates about the monetisation of data 
in this way.
[
11
]
 
 ‘We are the part-time custodian of data about  
our customers.’ 
— Data Lead, major retailer 
Organisations should also experiment with open APIs that 
allow shoppers to securely access and port data about them 
directly to other organisations, rather than maintaining a 
separate locker. This is likely to prove more convenient for 
shoppers and provide an alternative to mediating power 
through a third party. Projects by If provide a possible 
application of this in their prototype portable shopping list.
[
12
]
 
Provide shoppers with services that benefit them 
We found shoppers were comfortable sharing data where 
they see clear benefits and value, particularly around helping 
them save money or increasing control over personal data. 
Those we surveyed who were comfortable with current data 
practices in general were more likely to see innovations as 
beneficial, with 42% feeling comfortable sharing data if 
 
it would help them save money, and 26% if they received  
a product or service in return for this data. 
Scenarios for the future of data in  
grocery retail
During focus groups with shoppers, we described potential 
products and services that depended on access to data 
about them. The two scenarios described here were the  
most popular, with roughly half of the shoppers feeling that 
these services would be beneficial to them.
[

Helping shoppers save money 
 Product: service that prices your shopping list up from 
different supermarkets 
Roger is a student who cannot afford to spend much money 
on food shopping and needs to save where possible.  
By sharing his previous transactions with Tesco to this 
service, it determines his standard ‘shopping list’ and brand 
preferences to price up his list amongst participating retailers. 
He can also indicate where he would like to spend more to 
ensure quality. Using this information, organisations can offer 
him coupons and incentives for frequently purchased goods, 
helping Roger make decisions to save money.
52% of shoppers viewed this as beneficial and 47% were 
comfortable with this service.

Case study: Being trusted
 
with data: the Co-op
 
The Co-op is taking active steps to build trust around 
personal data with shoppers, based on three principles:
[
13
]
 
 Transparency: understanding what processes, habits 
and tools should be adopted to meet shoppers’ needs 
around transparency
 Integrity: exploring how to implement data standards 
and regulatory requirements in a way that is consistent 
with the wider data governance community
 Meaningful consent: starting conversations  
with shoppers about data consent through surveys  
and events 
By engaging customers to understand their needs, the 
supermarket discovered that 70% of respondents were 
happy to share data if it benefited their community.
[
14
]
  
More widely, the sector can help extend the benefits of 
data sharing by encouraging shoppers to contribute data 
to public good causes, such as food waste reduction,  
and by volunteering aggregated data to bodies such as  
the Office of National Statistics to inform the census. 
 ‘Maximising trust helps empower our members.’
— Catherine Brien, Data Science Director, the Co-op

Open Data Institute 2017 / Whitepaper The EU General Data Protection Regulation: opportunities for grocery retail 16
Explore opportunities to innovate with data governance 
and standards
Meeting the increased demand for data access and data 
portability with current processes is likely to be costly. 
Satisfying that demand efficiently requires open Application 
Programming Interfaces (APIs) to enable shoppers to access 
the data held about them.
[
16
] 
 
Case study: Using APIs to 
improve communication, 
collaboration and competition 
in Amazon 
APIs are powerful tools for increasing internal 
communication around data, building data literacy and 
encouraging partnerships across teams. By introducing 
APIs in the early 2000s, Amazon was able to become 
service-oriented and experienced massive growth. 
This move meant all teams within Amazon had to  
interact technically using APIs, with no other internal 
communication or back-door technical processes.  
While intended for internal use, Amazon encouraged  
these interfaces to be designed so they could eventually 
be exposed externally.
The move encouraged partnership across the company,  
as teams had to understand each other’s needs in order  
to build useful APIs. Opening these APIs up to external 
developers led to a greater understanding of the needs  
of both the market and end-users, enabling the company  
to make better strategic decisions about new products.
To maximise the benefit of APIs, organisations will need  
to work together to develop standards that encourage 
innovation and address shoppers’ needs.
Open standards for APIs and other things can create  
and change markets. They are both a great leveller  
and a platform to foster innovation and competition.  
There is historical precedent to indicate the impact of  
open standards: standard railway gauges and shipping 
containers brought about historical change in industry,  
and open standards underpin the internet, web and  
many of the services built on top of them. The best 
standards are developed openly, developed by 
organisations who are working together and delivering 
services that use them.
Understanding what data retailers have about you 
 Product: Dashboard that shows your personal data 
Mary wants to know what data retailers have about her. She 
usually shops at Tesco but doesn’t know what data Tesco has 
collected about her. She gave her name and birthday to the 
retailer, but is not aware of other data. With the dashboard, 
she can access her shopping history, analyse her shopping 
habits and decide to edit, delete or transfer data to improve 
the services of another organisation she uses.
50% of shoppers viewed this as beneficial and 45% were 
comfortable with this service.
Opportunities to innovate will benefit 
shoppers and shareholders
Nearly half of the shoppers we surveyed planned to use  
their right to data access, and a quarter their right to data 
portability, so the UK grocery retail sector must be prepared 
to respond efficiently and effectively to comply, but also go 
further in providing trusted services that shoppers value. 
 ‘I’m excited about data portability because it will 
give people an opportunity to take control of how 
data about them is used’
— Sarah Gold, Founder, Projects by If
 
 
Innovating to provide new and improved offerings
GDPR gives the UK grocery retail sector the opportunity to 
explore how to provide new and improved services that meet 
shoppers’ needs. 
One organisation exploring the opportunities that personal 
data presents is Tesco, through the Tesco Labs initiative.  
By running Hackathons and working with third parties like  
If This Then That – which helps users do more with their apps 
and devices – the supermarket is innovating with data to 
provide new and improved products. Others in the sector 
should explore how to invest in similar initiatives to find 
potential products and services that could be built around 
access and portability rights. 
 ‘It’s not good enough to feel ‘fairly confident’ that  
the data held is being used in the interests of  
the customer. It’s a requirement that new levels  
of scrutiny are applied here, and the customer’s 
perspective is the be-all and end-all guide to 
whether you are getting it right.’

Case study: Collaboration  
in the banking sector: 
implementing open data  
and open APIs 
The UK government has mandated the nine major retail 
banks to implement both open data and open APIs for 
customer data, in order to encourage competition and 
make it easier for new providers to create innovative 
services.
[18] 
Both open data about products and branch 
locations and open APIs for customer data were needed to 
drive the desired change. It is not possible for innovators  
to make most use of customer data without the reference 
data that makes it understandable and useable.
The Open Banking Implementation Entity is implementing  
this mandate by developing the necessary data and API 
standards with a range of stakeholders in the sector.
[19]
  
Over time, this will develop into an ongoing open process  
that continually improves accessibility to retail bank data 
for the benefit of consumers and industry. 
Organisations across the UK grocery retail sector would 
benefit from more data-literate shoppers who understood 
the benefits of sharing data and felt comfortable sharing 
data in exchange for services they value. The sector is in 
 
a position to collaborate to raise public awareness around 
data, drawing from initiatives such as the Safer Internet 
Day or Lloyd’s Digital Champions.
[
20
]
 Increasing data 
literacy and trust around the sector’s activities is likely to 
make shoppers more comfortable with how data about 
them is used for benefits they receive. 
Collaborating to solve problems:  
a view from other sectors
As organisations respond to new laws and trends in the 
data landscape, they will experience common challenges 
– such as building trust with shoppers, improving data 
literacy and strengthening data infrastructure. Investing in 
common initiatives, such as a sector-wide data working 
group, could help the sector respond to these trends  
in a stronger, more cost-effective and collaborative way. 
A data working group could address and encourage the 
sharing of non-personal data, such as product reference  
data or the location of physical stores. Sharing this would  
help build a culture of open innovation by getting retail sector 
organisations to work together to publish data, and by 
connecting them with external organisations that could use 
the data to build valuable new products and services.  
In other sectors, we have seen existing businesses both 
surprised and inspired by what external organisations do  
with data previously held behind closed doors: the release  
of open laser mapping data from the Department for 
Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) was used by 
growers in the wine industry to identify places to grow new 
and better quality grapes.

The following recommendations guide the first steps  
toward maximising opportunities from GDPR. 
Build trust by communicating with shoppers 
Run a data literacy campaign for shoppers, to build 
awareness of data use within retail 
The sector should collaborate to run a data literacy campaign 
to educate shoppers about data use in retail. Data literacy  
will help shoppers to give informed consent when sharing 
personal data and build trust. 
Focus on building informed consent and helping 
shoppers understand the benefits created by  
data sharing
The sector should proactively engage shoppers to build 
understanding around how they want to exercise their rights 
under the new laws, particularly in giving consent. Retailers 
should ensure they communicate the benefits that shoppers 
would receive by continuing to share their data, such as 
personalised services. Organisations that engage with 
shoppers will be able to understand their needs, direct 
resources to ideas with most potential, and set themselves 
apart in the market.
 
Create a foundation for data-enabled 
innovation 
Open up common reference data, such as products  
and retail locations
The sector uses large amounts of reference data – for 
example, the information on a product’s label (product 
reference data) or a store’s location, that are not openly 
licensed. This prevents its use by third parties and stifles 
innovation in the sector. Publishing this information openly  
will help third parties find opportunities to provide a more 
streamlined service for organisations and shoppers. 
Develop open standards to facilitate data exchange 
Open standards will be necessary for shoppers to exercise 
their new rights and for the sector to benefit from sharing 
non-personal data. The sector should build upon the work  
of organisations like standards body GS1 UK in creating 
standards for product data, and explore how implementing 
open standards in other parts of the sector could help  
build a culture of open innovation. 
Create open APIs to reduce cost and friction when 
shoppers request to access and share data 
The sector should help shoppers to exercise control over  
data about them through providing open APIs. Enabling 
shoppers to efficiently and securely access data and transfer 
it between organisations will increase the flow of data 
between all parts of the sector, unlocking innovation and 
delivering better services, as well as enabling the sector  
to comply with new laws. 
Create a strategic programme for the UK 
grocery retail sector 
Form a cross-sector strategic working group on retail 
data to enable a collaborative response to challenges 
raised by GDPR 
The sector should form a working group to address GDPR 
and broader sector trends in an open and collaborative way. 
This will help stakeholders to implement the requirements 
 
of the new law, such as creating common standards to permit 
data portability.
Many in the sector have already expressed support for 
working collaboratively to address the logistical issues  
arising from GDPR. Given the other products many retailers 
offer, such as furniture and electronics, some organisations 
were also willing to work with organisations beyond the 
grocery retail space to implement similar standards and 
principles. It is likely that other sector working groups will 
emerge in response to similar pressures. Any working group 
or other collaboration should draw lessons from the success 
of Open Banking and Open Active,
[
21
]
 similar initiatives in the 
banking and sports sectors. 
Create and implement principles around data 
governance and usage for grocery retail
Some shoppers feel uninformed and uncomfortable  
with how the sector uses data about them. Overcoming  
these concerns and building trust will require the sector  
to collaborate to implement common principles around  
data collection and use, using tools like the ODI’s Data  
Ethics Canvas.
[
22
]
These changes will enable the sector to respond to new  
laws and thrive in the new data landscape, providing value  
for shoppers, stakeholders and the wider UK population.

Recommendations

Open Data Institute 2017 / Whitepaper The EU General Data Protection Regulation: opportunities for grocery retail 20
This report was supported by three strands of research, 
funded by dunnhumby and supported by consultancy  
Britain Thinks.
The ODI conducted desk research to assess the current  
data landscape and the implications of GPDR for the sector, 
consulting legislation, supermarket and third-party websites, 
and previous consumer research. A GDPR expert was 
consulted to ensure the accuracy of information, although  
this should not be taken as legal advice.
Interviews were conducted with supermarkets, third parties, 
trade bodies and startups in the sector to gain an industry 
perspective. Each interview lasted half an hour, discussing 
current data practices and the expected effects of GDPR on 
their service and product offerings and communications. 
Britain Thinks was commissioned to conduct consumer 
research with shoppers to understand how shoppers viewed 
personal data and its use in the grocery retail sector.  
The research consisted of a qualitative phase followed by  
a quantitative survey across the general population.
In the qualitative phase, four two-hour focus groups were  
held with shoppers, split between Watford and Manchester. 
Focus groups were structured by age and attitude to 
technology use, split into early adopters and mainstream 
consumers. Six in-depth interviews were conducted with 
special interest groups, including older people and those  
who had experienced a data breach or fraud, to explore the 
views of potentially vulnerable consumers.
The quantitative phase consisted of a 10-minute online survey 
involving 1,970 shoppers. This was weighted to be nationally 
representative of the UK adult population aged over 18, with 
participants screened to ensure they were regular shoppers. 
Questions were designed using insights from the qualitative 
phase, such as using language and terminology that were 
intuitive to shoppers.
Methodology

Open Data Institute 2017 / Whitepaper The EU General Data Protection Regulation: opportunities for grocery retail 21
Application Programme Interface (API)
A proven technology that can help provide access to open 
data (such as a list of products that a bank provides)  
and secure shared access to private data (such as a list  
of the transactions in an individual’s bank statements).  
Data accessed via an open API may be closed, shared  
or open. Open APIs, for the applications described herein,  
need to be supported by robust security, legal and 
governance frameworks. 
Data aggregator 
An organisation that brings together large amounts of data, 
including information about products, stores and channels  
to provide a high-level view of the grocery retail sector. 
Data analytics provider  
An organisation that provides analytical services to help other 
organisations (generally supermarkets) extract more value 
from their products and brands.
 
Data controller 
An organisation that controls how and why personal data  
is processed. They are responsible for ensuring compliance 
with data protection laws, such as GDPR. 
Data infrastructure 
Data infrastructure consists of data assets, the organisations 
that operate and maintain them and guides describing how  
to use and manage the data. It includes technology, 
processes and organisations. Trustworthy data infrastructure 
is sustainably funded and has oversight that provides 
direction to maximise data use and value by meeting the 
needs of society. 
Data processor 
An organisation that processes personal data on behalf  
of data controllers. 
Early adopter 
A person who is among the first of their friends and family  
to try out new products, services and technology.  
General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) 
EU regulation on the handling of EU citizens’ personal data  
by public and private sector organisations. It is scheduled to 
come into force in the UK on 25 May 2018. 
Mainstream consumer  
A person who is likely to wait for products, services and 
technology to become popular and widely used before using 
it themselves. 
Machine-readable format  
Publishing data as machine readable includes (1) established 
standard vocabularies, (2) enriching the HTML resources  
with metadata, semantics and identifiers, and (3) 
implementing simple, manageable and stable Uniform 
Resource Identifiers (URIs). 
Open data  
Data that anyone can access, use and share. For data to  
be considered ‘open’, it must be accessible (which usually 
means published on the web); available in a machine-
readable format; and licensed for anyone to access, use  
and share, commercially and non-commercially. 
Personal data  
Data from which a person can be identified, including  
data that can be combined with other information to identify  
a person.
