3Open data roadmap for the UK | Open Data Institute 2015
Around  the  world,  governments,  businesses  
and communities are drawing on data and 
digital technologies to help respond to 
challenges that surround us. 
Open  data:  an  essential  part  of  
modern policy-making
Open data has emerged as a core component of 
the  UK’s  commitment  to  open  policy-making.  It  
is key to the digital transformation of government, 
which will only continue to increase in pace with 
the next parliament. 
The  UK  has  already  taken  steps  to  harness  the  
benefits of open data for improved policy-making, 
and social, environmental and economic benefit. 
The Open Data Institute’s open data roadmap sets 
out steps the government can take to continue to 
drive progress. 
What is open data?
Open  data  is  data  that  is  made  available  by  
government,  businesses  and  individuals  for  
anyone to access, use and share. Open data is:
• helping government to make public services 
more efficient;
• driving innovation and economic growth by 
revealing opportunities for businesses and 
startups to build new services;
• offering citizens insights into how central and 
local  government  works,  improving  public  trust  
and boosting political engagement; and
• helping government and communities to keep 
track of local spending and performance.
Not all data is open data
Data can be freely accessible but that does not 
mean  it  is  ‘open  data’.  For  example,  we  can  
access  Twitter  feeds  any  time,  but  we  cannot  
reuse the data without buying a licence with strict 
conditions.  Open  data  is  data  that  is  published  
under a licence with express permission to reuse, 
share and modify. 
Some data will be closed for reasons like privacy, 
commerciality and security. Open data should not 
compromise privacy: in any circumstances where 
personal data is being dealt with, there need to 
be  meaningful  privacy  safeguards  and  ways  for  
people to access their own data.

Making UK public services more efficient
The UK’s aging and increasing population will put new pressures on its healthcare system and 
economy over the next 15 years. Over £200m per year in potential NHS savings have been found 
using open data, which showed where general practitioners throughout the country could be 
prescribing generic drugs instead of branded versions. These savings were revealed in 2012 
by ODI startup Mastodon C, in collaboration with Open Health Care UK and science writer Ben 
Goldacre, by analysing the prescription records of every family doctor in the UK, without releaving 
their patients’ identities.
Preparing UK cities for the next 7 million people
With the UK population expected to increase by 10% over the next 15 years, to around 70.7 
million people,
1
 space in UK cities is at a premium. Cities across the UK have started opening 
up their data for new apps to help plan and scale their infrastructure. For example, University 
College London researcher Oliver O’Brien used data from the London Datastore to map how 
many people enter and exit tube stations, and how this changes over time. His research has 
helped inform tube planning around service delivery and staffing.

Adjusting services to an unpredictable climate
Rising temperatures will mean more extreme weather for the UK. In 2014, floods in the UK 
highlighted the need for better communication in emergency prevention and response. Open 
data is being used around the world to help target responses to natural disasters. In the aftermath 
of  the  2010  Haiti  earthquake,  OpenStreetMap  collated  open  mapping  data,  and  became  the  
authoritative source of information about roads, buildings and camps of displaced people. Open 
data was also at the centre of relief efforts after the 2013 Typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines.

6Open data roadmap for the UK | Open Data Institute 2015
The  UK  is  ranked  number  one  in  the  world  for  
its  leadership  in  open  data  by  the  Open  Data  
Barometer (2013). For more than a decade, UK 
governments of various political parties have built 
on the open data initiatives of their predecessors 
to encourage open data to be released and reused 
across government: from the launch of the Power 
of Information Review by the Blair government in 
2007,  to  the  implementation  of  the  data.gov.uk  
open  data  portal  under  the  Brown  government  
in  2009,  to  David  Cameron’s  letter  to  cabinet  
ministers in 2010, affirming previous progress 
in  open  data  and  setting  out  the  coalition’s  
transparency agenda. 
Among  the  UK’s  many  successes  have  been  
the publication of more than 15,000 government 
datasets  as  open  data;  the  chairing  of  the 
inaugural Open Government Partnership in 2011; 
the introduction of the Open Government Licence; 
the launch of the Open Data Institute; and frequent 
training  opportunities  and  incentives  for  public  
bodies to release more open data.
This means the UK is perfectly 
placed to unlock value
The efforts of the Government Digital Service, the 
Department  for  Business,  Innovation  and  Skills  
and the Cabinet Office have contributed to the 
UK’s  world-class  digital  government  service  
delivery. 
There is still more data that can be released, 
more uses of data that can be demonstrated 
and more that can be done to improve data 
quality and literacy. 
The UK has made great strides in open data so far, 
and must continue to move forward boldly.

7Open data roadmap for the UK | Open Data Institute 2015
New businesses are emerging
with open data
As  more  open  data  is  released,  businesses  are  
using  it  to  grow.  Startups  supported  by  the  
ODI  have  used  open  data  to  build  businesses  
around government procurement, health savings, 
smart cities, energy efficiency, 3D-printing and 
supporting  disabled  communities.  They  have  
attracted clients from both the public and private 
sectors,  and,  between  them,  generated  £2.5m  
since 2012.
The UK’s efforts in open data have fostered new 
kinds  of  innovation  and  new  business  models.  
Now the focus is moving onto sustainability.
A sustainable open data culture
The ODI has been engaging groups from across 
the UK’s open data communities to gather their 
feedback and build on this strong foundation. 
Based on these conversations, the ODI’s roadmap 
for open data in the UK sets out recommendations 
for  how  to  achieve  a  sustainable  open  data  
culture.  The  roadmap  also  builds  on  a  range  of  
policy  documents  that  have  been  released  this  
year,  including:  the  Royal  Statistical  Society’s  
Data Manifesto; Policy Exchange’s Technology 
Manifesto; and the Institute for Government’s 
Programme for Effective Government. 
In  2015,  the  ODI  will  continue  to  explore  the  
prerequisites  for  widespread  impact  from  open  
data, through discussions with UK stakeholders, 
technical briefings and regular blog-posts on the 
ODI website. We will continue to invite feedback 
as  we  move  from  laying  the  foundations  for  a  
sustainable open data culture, to putting it into 
practice. 
Open data roadmap for the UK | Open Data Institute 2015

8Open data roadmap for the UK | Open Data Institute 2015
The next UK Government should:
 1.  Clearly embed open data within a wider data strategy
 2.  Appoint a Chief Data Officer for government to oversee this strategy
 3.  Build data publication into all government digital services
 1.  Support UK trading funds to release more closed datasets as open data
 2.  Use the National Information Infrastructure as a tool for future releases
 3.  Include the release of open data in government procurement contracts
 1.  Commit to data training for government, business and citizens
 2.  Incentivise government to consume open data, not just publish it
 3.  Connect research and development frameworks to open data 

9Open data roadmap for the UK.   Open Data Institute 2014
The central government has stimulated a range 
of activities around open data. Now is the time 
to connect and focus them. 
 1.  Invest in a data framework:
embed open data as part of a
wider data strategy
Some aspects of data policy, like open data, data 
sharing and data science are dealt with by different 
teams  in  the  Cabinet  Office.  Data  protection  
and IP rights in data are coordinated by other 
departments. The responsibility for all aspects of 
data policy should lie in one place within the Cabinet 
Office, and be more clearly aligned with digital 
service delivery. The Information Commissioner’s 
Office should oversee regimes governing both 
access  to  and  reuse  of  public  information,  and  
be supported to continue to improve its services. 
The  data  strategy  should  cover  data  owned  by  
central and local government, other public bodies 
and organisations outside government, wherever 
possible.
 2 .  Give the framework oversight 
and political attention: appoint a 
Chief Data Officer, who, as part 
of their role, will monitor and seek 
the publication of open data
A government data strategy needs strong strategic 
leadership. A Chief Data Officer position created 
within the Cabinet Office should be provided with 
budget and a team to develop, advocate for and 
seek  progress  on  all  aspects  of  the  UK’s  data  
strategy. The Chief Data Officer position would 
report to the Executive Director of Digital in the 
Cabinet Office, explicitly aligning data as part of 
the government’s ‘digital by default’ strategy. The 
Chief Data Officer should be able to compel the 
release  of  data  as  high-quality,  open  data  from  
public bodies, where it is in the public interest to 
do so.
 3 .  Combine policy with delivery:
support the Government Digital 
Service to develop a world-class 
data publishing platform for use 
by the public sector
The  Government  Digital  Service  is  transforming  
online government services, and making it easier 
to find information about government. Similar 
attention  should  be  paid  to  embedding  high-
quality  data  publication  into  all  digital  services  
across  government.  The  GDS  is  best  placed  
to exercise this role. GOV.UK and the Office of 
National  Statistics  website  should  be  invested  
in to enhance high-quality open data publication. 

10Open data roadmap for the UK | Open Data Institute 2015
The UK Government has published a lot of open 
data, but it still holds important datasets that 
are  ‘closed’  –  that  is,  not  openly  licensed  for  
reuse. These datasets could have significant 
social, environmental and economic benefits 
if released as high-quality open data.
 
 1 .  Open up: invest in the release
of important datasets as open data
The  standard  for  UK  public  sector  data  is  open  
by  default.  Geospatial  data,  address  data,  
meteorological  data  and  land  valuations  data  
all  hold  immense  potential  if  released  as  high-
quality  open  data.  Trading  funds  including  
Ordnance Survey, the Met Office, Land Registry 
and Companies House need to be empowered to 
continue to release more open data. In Denmark, 
in 2002, the government made its national address 
file free; since then it has calculated a 30 to 1 ratio 
of direct financial benefits to cost.

 2 .  Think big: use the National 
Information Infrastructure to plan 
for the future
 
The  National  Information  Infrastructure  is  a  
potentially  powerful  strategic  asset  to  prioritise  
and incentivise the release of important datasets.  
It needs thoughtful design and investment so that 
it is more than a static list of datasets: it needs to 
change and evolve as other infrastructures do. So 
far, the NII has largely highlighted important but 
closed datasets, without a means of opening them 
up, or a plan for identifying future data assets. The 
new Chief Data Officer should be able to release 
important datasets identified through the NII as 
open data, taking account of what public bodies 
and the wider community want and need.
 3 .  Set best-practice for the 
future: mandate that government 
procurement contracts require 
the release of open data
The UK has committed to being “open by default” 
under the G8 Open Data Charter. Embedding 
open data into procurement contracts will ensure 
that data produced in future, as part of the delivery 
of goods and services for government, is opened 
up. The government should also proactively look 
for tenders that will generate significant amounts 
of data. The ODI has published a guide, Procuring 
open data in the public sector, which outlines how 
open data can be embedded into the procurement 
of public services. 

11Open data roadmap for the UK | Open Data Institute 2015
Across the UK, businesses, researchers, citizens 
and  public  bodies  already  rely  on  open  data  
to  deliver  products  and  services  and  help  
lower  costs,  often  without  realising.  With  a  
clear UK data strategy, strong implementation 
and  access  to  high-value,  good-quality  
datasets, the number of businesses, research 
projects, innovative services and new ways of 
interpreting open data will continue to flourish.
 
 1.  Commit to data training and 
skills development for government, 
business and citizens
In October 2013, the government published its  
strategy  for  increasing  UK  data  capability,  with  
strong emphasis on data skills development. The 
nation needs more data scientists and statisticians, 
equipped with basic skills that can be applied in 
all fields of data analysis. Civil servants should be 
trained in basic data literacy skills, including open 
data. Open data training encourages collaboration 
across different kinds of data, and will ultimately 
foster the data scientists of tomorrow. 
 2 .  Incentivise government to 
consume open data, not just
publish itr 
Training  the  next  generation  of  data  scientists  
and statisticians will be of little benefit if their 
skills  are  not  put  to  good  use.  Government  
departments need to be encouraged to use open 
data themselves, published by both government 
and  business,  and  to  request  more  open  data  
from  businesses  to  advance  policy  goals.  The  
government should introduce a rewards scheme 
for innovative uses of the open data it releases.
 3 .  Connect research and 
development frameworks to open 
data
The Royal Statistical Society highlights increased 
investment in R&D as an essential element of its 
data manifesto, to strengthen data and statistics 
for better policy-making, greater democracy and 
increased  prosperity,  and  the  ODI  agrees.  The  
funding framework for R&D can also be explicitly 
aligned with open data. Where R&D is supported 
by public funds, the data that is created should 
be made available to other researchers, as open 
data  wherever  possible.  Existing  and  future 
investments in data science and R&D, including 
big data initiatives, should form a coordinated and 
complementary research landscape.
