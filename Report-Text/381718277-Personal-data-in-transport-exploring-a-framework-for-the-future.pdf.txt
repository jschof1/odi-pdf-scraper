This report has been researched and produced by the Open Data Institute, and 
published in June 2018. Its lead author was Libby Young, with contributions from 
Gillian Whitworth, Jared Robert Keller, Jamie Fawcett, Miranda Marcus, Jessica 
Weereratne, Caley Dewhurst, Anna Scott, Peter Wells and Jeni Tennison. 
 
The purpose of the report is to help transport companies make better decisions 
about how they use personal data in their business models for the future. Our 
focus is journey data, a form of ​personal data the sector has always needed, now 
accessible in new ways and at new scales. 
 
The report coincides with the implementation of the EU’s General Data Protection 
Regulation (GDPR). It is one of the most comprehensive pieces of regulation yet to 
deal with personal data, and is changing the way businesses across sectors 
collect and use data.  
 
The GDPR is just one part of a growing trend towards people exercising more 
control over data about them, so we take a long term view on this as well as other 
trends – the increasing collection and use of journey data in transport, and the 
benefits this can create for businesses who foster and earn trust by engaging with 
us as they use data about us ethically and equitably. 
 
We hope businesses find the research and learning shared here helpful in 
exploring how to ​address and lead change around these trends, and as they work 
to find ways to make travel more accessible, affordable and sustainable for all.

A note on language: 
We don’t ‘own’ data  
 
At the ODI, we believe that data does not belong to any one person, not 
least because data about us is often also about other people. Our DNA, for 
example, reveals information about our parents and family. Utility bills 
reveal who we live with. Health records contain information about medical 
professionals. This is why we do not refer to ‘my or your data’ but instead 
use ‘data about me, you, us or them’.  
 
Many people can have rights to – and responsibilities for – data. For 
instance, many people and organisations may have intellectual property 
rights due to their contributions to the data. In transport, people often take 
journeys with family or friends, so ticket or location data can be connected 
to or used to identify more than one person. In connected vehicles such as 
cars, drivers and their passengers may be connected with other traffic 
participants. 
 
By avoiding possessive pronouns we hope to encourage understanding of 
the wider network of relationships involved in data collection and use. Put 
simply, neither individuals or organisations should think of themselves as 
owning data. Instead they should think of themselves as holding or 
stewarding data with the goals of both protecting the rights of people 
impacted by the data and ensuring that people who have the right to 
access and use it can get the data when they need it to make a decision.

Executive summary 
Using journey data to meet a universal need  
Transport is a universal need: almost everyone travels regularly, be it walking, 
taking a bus, using a car or going by train. These journeys often generate data that 
can reveal things about us – where we work, where our loved ones live, what we 
like to do. This journey data is personal data.  
 
The role of journey data in transport is changing. It is being collected in real time 
and used on new scales, creating insights into individual and aggregated mobility. 
Businesses and public services can use this data to make operational and policy 
decisions to improve transport services, user experience or infrastructure. 
Innovative new mobility services are also emerging 
 
New ways of operating transport, such as bikesharing and ridesharing, and new 
ways of accessing transport, like journey planners and smart ticketing, are 
changing the sector. These on-demand, personalised services can help people 
save time and money, be more (or less) active, own fewer or no means of 
transport, lower their carbon footprint, or travel in other ways that meet their 
individual or societal needs. This also opens up ways to make transport systems 
more user-centred for more people and for the full length of their desired journeys. 
In the future, travellers could complete trips door-to-door using a single planner 
and ticket and access varied public and private transport as their journey requires. 
 
 
Through our interviews with industry, workshops and research we found that 
journey data can be used and shared to benefit people, organisations and 
our transport systems more broadly in three ways:  
 
●to increase accessibility and personalisation for people 
●to improve operational efficiency and innovation for organisations 
●to tackle systemic transport issues for the benefit of everyone 
 
We also uncovered areas that must be explored to help realise this potential 
equitably, using data about us ethically, and in ways that support our systems. 
For instance, just as open data from public transport and other sources supports 
new mobility services, these new services now hold journey datasets that can 
support better decision-making about transport infrastructure and operations. 
Many companies are thinking about ways to make aggregated and de-identified 
journey data more open for this purpose, and some of them are testing ways to do 
so. Further exploration is encouraged. 
 
Our research also showed that sharing journey and other transport data more 
widely requires us to address technical barriers including inconsistent open 
standards, data silos and poor interoperability of data. Breaking down these 
barriers will require collaboration and investment across the sector. 
 
Most importantly, we found that journey data is transforming relationships 
between companies and customers, drastically increasing the importance of trust, 
and raising critical questions of ethics, equity and engagement which cannot go 
unanswered. ​The impact of these trends will only increase as people grow more 
aware of these issues and as they gain more rights over data about them.  
 
These shifts create both opportunities and challenges for businesses. ​Based on 
these and our other findings, we recommend transport organisations: 
 
Open Data Institute 2018 Personal data in transport: exploring a framework for the future4 

i) Develop a strategic and ethical approach to data ​by looking beyond 
compliance with regulation to develop governance policies and processes, 
investing in training and resources, and engaging with sector initiatives.  
 
ii) Lay the foundations for and engage in data-enabled innovation​ by 
supporting open standards and APIs, practising open innovation, and 
exploring new ways to partner with public services. 
 
iii) Foster trusted relationships with customers​ by communicating with them 
clearly, finding ways to build more informed consent into the user 
experience and explaining the benefits created by data sharing. 
 
iv) Explore sharing more journey data safely and securely in three ways: 
1. As open data​ – with careful and appropriate aggregation and 
anonymisation, and accompanied by privacy impact assessments  
2. In secure environments​ – in particular with accredited researchers, 
who should openly publish their results  
3. With people the data is about​ – through open APIs and in ways that  
enable innovation.  
 
There is much at stake for us all in the future of data and sharing data in transport. 
For economies, the Transport Systems Catapult says data-enabled innovations in 
transport may be worth ​£900bn​ by 2025, and conversely, not sharing transport 
data may cost a country like the UK ​£15bn.  
1
 
For individuals, sharing journey and other data to increase personalisation of and 
access to transport can improve our quality of life. Conversely, if personal data is 
used in ways that erode trust it can create data wastelands (where data is not 
collected or used), limiting the potential for transport systems to benefit everyone.  
 
A future in transport where data is shared and used in ways that combine 
openness and innovation with ethics and trust has powerful potential to benefit 
our societies and economies. 
 
 
 
Data is infrastructure, like transport 
 
Infrastructure powers our societies. It provides the fundamental services and 
systems that enable our economies to function, allow us to communicate, 
and improve and support our lives. 
 
When we think of infrastructure we first think of roads, bridges, water 
supplies and electrical grids. But infrastructure also takes less tangible forms, 
such as ideas, basic research and the internet.  
 
Data is becoming as important as our physical infrastructure – it underpins 
every sector of our economies and impacts every aspect of society. Roads 
help us navigate to a place; data helps us navigate to a decision.  
 
Data infrastructure consists of data assets, the organisations that operate 
and maintain them, and the guides describing how to use and manage the 
data. Trustworthy data infrastructure is sustainably funded and is directed to 
maximise data use and value, meeting society’s needs. 
 
Data infrastructure that is as open as possible creates the most value. Like 
other types of infrastructure it is invisible (when it works). Making it as open

Open Data Institute 2018 Personal data in transport: exploring a framework for the future5 

as possible, while respecting privacy, helps to support a huge variety of uses 
and ecosystems.  
 
Governments, businesses and communities plan essential physical 
infrastructure strategically – including our highways, electricity lines, water 
courses and broadband connections – and we should treat data 
infrastructure in the same way.  
 
Why is journey data personal data? 
Our journeys from location to location through time can be used to infer where we 
work and shop, what we earn and what we do in our free time. These are all things 
about us. Data collected when we make journeys is revealing more about us than 
ever, such as when and where we travel with friends, family or colleagues. For 
2
these reasons, journey data is personal data.  
 
Historically, public and private transport providers collected journey data as 
‘counts’, i.e. the number of people on a train, bus tickets sold or cars using a road. 
These counts were usually not tied to individuals, except when people took part in 
customer surveys. The data helped transport organisations make decisions about 
things like timetables or the location of bus stops.  
 
In the last few years, GPS-enabled devices, smartphones and NFC-enabled smart 
tickets and payment cards have made journey data easier and cheaper to collect. 
Parts of the sector have moved on from ‘counts’ to data collected using these 
technologies, at much larger scales and in real time, across modes of transport. 
These richer journey datasets can help decision-makers improve transport 
planning, personalise services and tackle systemic issues. They have increased 
innovation by established operators and allowed new mobility services to emerge. 
 
Our increasing use of these technologies to plan journeys and access transport is 
allowing banks and smartphone makers to collect journey data. Banks can do this 
when providing payment services for transport. And smartphone makers can 
collect data each time we enable our location services during a journey, or when 
we access mobility services on our phones. Telecom providers have historically 
3
collected customer location data, generally by triangulating mobile phone signals, 
but this data is not considered reliable enough to use as journey data supporting 
decision-making in transport.  
 
All this journey data can be pseudonymised with identifiers like random numbers, 
allowing journeys by one individual to be linked without using direct identifiers like 
names. However, even when data is pseudonymised, there is still a risk of 
re-identification when it is linked to other datasets. One ​study​ found that four data 
points on time and location can identify 95% of people in a dataset. Others have 
4
mapped a ​cyclist’s journeys​ with TfL data, or identified ​trips made by taxi drivers 
5
in New York.

Consumers and regulators are becoming more engaged with the issues around 
this and personal data more broadly. How organisations develop their personal

 ​This report focuses on transport customers, but we note that employees of transport 
companies, like bus drivers and station guards, are also affected by most of these issues.

data strategies could increasingly become a differentiator for transport 
organisations. We will look at some of the opportunities and risks this can create 
for businesses later in this report.  
 
 
 
 
Defining terms 
 
Legal and human definitions of personal 
data  
 
In debates about personal data there is often an undeclared tension 
between its legal definition and its human definition.  
 
Data protection regulations like the GDPR ​define personal data​ as specific 
bits of information about ‘an identifiable person’, such as name or location. 
7
People often feel differently, thinking of personal data more broadly, as any 
information which reveals something about them, such as where they work, 
what they like and who their loved ones are. 
 
In this report, we use the human definition because, while we will always 
need strong regulation, it is ultimately people who choose whether or not to 
trust a business with personal data about them.

Transport needs data 
Access to journey data is transforming the sector 
The role of data in transport is changing, as the sector shifts from data-poor to 
data-rich. In particular, journey data, a form of personal data the sector has always 
needed but has historically found hard to get, is now accessible in new ways and 
at new scales. Companies are collecting more of this data, more frequently, and in 
real time – as technology makes this more feasible and viable – and using it to 
innovate. Customers expect more personalisation and communication, and are 
sharing more real time data in order to get it.  
 
Our research and interviews with industry show transport companies are 
collecting data in a variety of ways. While cash-only taxis and buses collect little or 
no journey data, public transport operators such as trains and new private 
operators such as bikesharing and ridesharing companies can connect customer 
account details with real time data collected via smartphones, smart cards and 
other devices to gather journey data for single modes of transport. End-to-end 
mobility services like journey planners and smart ticketing services can collect 
journey data (and intended journey data, in the case of journey planners) across 
many journeys and modes of transport, creating multimodal or overarching views 
of transport in real time. Public transport providers who operate multiple modes of 
transport, such as Transport for London (TfL) can also create these powerful 
overviews. 
 
This real time journey data can be used and shared to benefit businesses, people 
and public services, potentially in ways that meet the needs of all three groups. 
This highlights that transport is an ecosystem of organisations, individuals and 
infrastructure depending on each other to achieve their goals. Our interviews, 
workshops and research called attention to three key areas of potential benefit:  
 
Increasing accessibility and personalisation for passengers  
– people can benefit from more personalised or affordable services as 
organisations use journey data to better understand and serve their needs. 
 
 
For example, services like Waze can crowdsource and share car journey data to 
help drivers choose their route based on live traffic patterns. TfL can use journey 
data in a personalised way, to warn passengers of relevant disruptions affecting 
their route and at times that allow them to adjust their journeys. Services like 
Moovit or Digital Matatus can help people use public transport in cities with less 
formal or discoverable networks (see Digital Matatus case study). 
 
Improving operational efficiency and innovation for organisations  
– ​private and public organisations can benefit by using journey data to 
make better decisions about how to use resources to develop or improve 
services. 
 
For example, TfL can ​use journey data​ collected through its Oyster cards to 
improve and plan its transport interchanges in London. Rideshare services can 
8
use journey planners – enabled by open data and journey data – to find and 
connect with customers. Bikeshare services can use journey data to help locate 
their bikes where customers want them, in turn leading to innovation in 
complementary services like ​Stage Intelligence​ which can help mobility services 
like bikesharing make these operational decisions.

Tackling systemic transport issues for the benefit of everyone  
– public services and governments ​can use data​ to better meet the travel 
needs of underserved communities, and address issues like the ‘last mile’, 
congestion and pollution. It can also help make previously expensive 
10
services more affordable for businesses to provide.  
 
 
For example, Stratford-upon-Avon startup Enable ID is collaborating with UK train 
operators to use personal data to explore intelligent accessibility for people with 
disabilities (see TOC Ability case study). Private companies are working with local 
authorities to develop smart bus services in rural areas currently underserved by 
public transport (see Smart Buses in the UK case study). Finnish startup MaaS 
Global is using multimodal transport and journey data to help tackle the last mile 
problem in Helsinki and the West Midlands (see Transport in Finland case study).  
 
 
Defining terms 
Transport, mobility, MaaS: explaining the 
differences 
 
In this report, the term ​transport​ is used to describe the whole ​ecosystem 
of moving people or goods from place to place. Transport is made up of 
11
physical infrastructure, as well as the organisations and individuals who own 
or operate the different modes of transport, such as trains, buses, bikes 
and cars.  
 
On the other hand, ​mobility​ refers to an individual’s journey from location to 
location through the transport system, either using one mode of transport, 
such as walking, or multiple modes of transport, such as a car + train + bus 
trip to a destination (also referred to as ​multimodal​ travel). 
 
The term mobility is often used in the context of ​intelligent mobility​, which 
is using ​‘emerging technologies to enable the smarter, greener and more 
efficient movement of people and goods’.​ More user-focused or newer 
12
transport companies often call themselves ​mobility services​.  
 
Some tie these concepts together as ‘​mobility as a service​’, or ​MaaS​. 
MaaS is an evolving concept which aims to combine the benefits of 
multimodal journey planners and smart ticketing to help people more easily 
and efficiently plan and pay for multimodal journeys. MaaS could change 
the way people consume public and private transport, enabling more 
multimodal journeys, reducing the need for private car ownership and 
improving ​end-to-end mobility​. 
 
End-to-end mobility relates to the ‘​last mile​’ problem, one of the systemic 
transport challenge we reference in this report. The last mile describes the 
movement of people to a final destination such as a home or place of work 
(in reverse order, this is also a first mile problem). This challenge highlights 
how hard it is to deliver physical transport infrastructure that meets the 
needs of all travellers, each with individual destinations.

Companies are thinking about sharing data  
Our interviews with transport companies showed a keen awareness of these 
trends in the collection and use of data, as well as an appreciation of the 
opportunities these trends create to develop services, earn the trust of customers 
to support data sharing, as well as support transport ecosystems overall. 
 
“ 
“We want to be able to share aggregated data 
to help innovation.”  
–​ ​Chris Perry, MaaS Global 
Some stakeholders want to put the data they collect to wider use, and early data 
sharing pilots are generating compelling results. For example, ​Waze’s data 
partnership with TfL​ has reduced delays on London’s most congested route, the 
Blackwall Tunnel, by using journey data to suggest drivers at risk of running out of 
fuel reroute to a nearby petrol station.  
13
 
“ 
“Urban mobility is a universal asset.”  
– Ed Parsons, Google 
There is also recognition from the sector that it needs to find safe and secure ways 
to make journey data it collects more open in ways that protect individual privacy 
and support transport ecosystems. Many businesses think better collaboration 
between organisations and clearer communication with people can help do this. 
 
“ 
“We need to work out how to share in a way 
that supports the wider system.”  
– Chris Perry, MaaS Global 
A growing number of businesses believe services that meet the needs of both 
individuals and communities can foster and earn the trust of users, especially 
when they tell users about these wider benefits. They observe that users share 
journey data more when they know it has a communal benefit, because they value 
the benefits that the journey data of others has given them.

“ 
 
“Once you enable the GPS to share 
anonymised data, you are getting better 
information from us, and you are also 
contributing this information to other people in 
your community”  
– Roy Bick, Moovit 
 
Some mobility services explicitly communicate this message to customers, 
sometimes as part of the user experience.  
 
“ 
“People are more open when it is for the 
greater good and if it is feeding back into their 
own travel experience.”  
– Max Stewart, Caution Your Blast 
 
 
Open standards in transport 
 
Open standards are an important part of our local, national and global data 
infrastructure. They help us to use, share and publish data in consistent and 
14
easy-to-access ways, and can help to change markets. Data-enabled 
innovation in transport depends on open standards. In order to work, most 
mobility services need to link journey data with real time transport data. Even 
companies like Waze and Moovit, who crowdsource data, need it. 
 
Transport has long been a leader in open data, supporting the creation of 
new mobility services around the world. For example, the ​General Transit 
Feed Specification​ (GTFS) is an open standard for public transport schedules 
originally started by Google and Portland, Oregon’s transit agency, TriMet. 
15
The ​Service Interface for Real Time Information​ (SIRI) is an open protocol to 
exchange real time information about public transport services and vehicles 
16
(GTFS also has a real time extension). More recently, the ​General Bikeshare 
Feed Specification​ (GBFS) developed by the North American Bike Share 
Association shares real time data for docked bikeshare services.

SharedStreets​ is an open data standard for describing streets, and has been 
developed specifically to support transport systems.  
18
Despite all this, open standards in transport are not yet universal. The UK is a 
case in point. For timetables, ​TransXChange​ is not used by National Rail, 
GTFS is not used by TfL. For stations, the UK has no open address register 
19
to support ​NaPTAN. Fare data is very fragmented (for instance, the Rail 
20
Delivery Group estimates there are currently ​55 million different train fares). 
21
For ticketing, some find the ​ITSO​ open standard hard to implement.  
22
 
Friction in interoperability can increase costs for data users and limit 
innovation, for instance by making it harder for new entrants to develop 
complementary services to support existing transport. In particular, poor 
interoperability limits innovation around MaaS. 
Consumers and policy makers are also thinking 
about sharing data  
Companies’ attitudes to sharing in transport align with the findings of a recent ​ODI 
survey​ of UK consumer attitudes to sharing personal data. The survey of over 
23
2000 consumers found that if a consumer trusts and knows an organisation, they 
are more likely to share personal data about them with that organisation. 94% of 
respondents said trust was important in deciding whether to share personal data. 
64% said they would share personal data with an organisation they know, 
compared to just 36% for an organisation they do not. 
 
The survey also showed consumers are prepared to make trade-offs to share data 
about them if it benefits them and society. While 15% said they would share data 
to get insights about themselves, even more (26%) would share personal data to 
help decide which public services to fund. 37% would share some data to help 
academic research, while the most popular ‘data trade-off’ in the survey was 
similarly for the greater good: nearly 50% said they would share personal data if it 
helped develop new medicines and treatments. We use ‘greater good’ in this 
report to refer to these types of trade offs, when an individual puts a community’s 
needs ahead of their own, or sees the two as connected, even inseparable. 
 
37% of people would share data about them  
to advance academic research 
 
Recent policy ​conversations​ about transport in the UK have focused on how to 
share data more. The 2017 ​Bus Services Act​ requires private bus operators to 
make fare, timetable and route data open, to give people access to more 
information. The Transport Systems Catapult, working with the ODI and Deloitte, 
identified​ ways for government to incentivise data sharing to support new mobility 
services. And a government ​inquiry​ is exploring ways to support MaaS.

Transport in Finland 
Connecting personal data with open data infrastructure for 
mobility-as-a-service 
 
Finland’s groundbreaking ​Act on Transport Services​, effective July 2018, 
requires every transport group, public or private, to share an open API. This 
25
legislation​ aims to support a shift to transport as ‘mobility-as-a-service’, 
meeting the travel needs of all Finnish citizens through single ticket, 
end-to-end, multimodal journeys. 
 
The Act builds on the success of ​Helsinki Region Infoshare​ (HRI), launched in 
2011. HRI shares hundreds of open ​datasets​ to support academic research,

business innovation and public engagement. It also uses ​meet-ups​, 
hackathons and social media to drive these efforts. HRI has created many 
benefits​. For instance, the Helsinki Regional Transport Authority journey 
planner open ​API​ has enabled many ​mobility services​ like:  
 
WHIM​ – MaaS Global’s application to help people in Helsinki plan 
and complete journeys easily and affordably without owning a car. 
The service is also in beta in ​Birmingham​ in the UK in a collaboration 
with Transport for West Midlands, National Express and Gett.  
27
 
TrafficSense​ – Aalto University’s research project collecting data on 
users’ regular journeys and linking it with real time and multimodal 
data on speeds, congestion and other data in order to give users 
more personalised suggestions when planning travel routes. 
28
 
Blindsquare​ – a GPS application helping visually impaired people 
travel independently. The voice-enabled app collects a user’s 
location and other personal data in order to personalise and share 
data such as street intersections, cafés and favourite locations. 
29
 
Alongside these initiatives, the government also supports ​MyData​, an alliance 
exploring ways to give people more control over data about them while 
helping businesses use this data to develop services built on trust.  
30
 
This emerging national framework for transport data infrastructure – 
integrating public and private services, supporting equity and ethics – could 
suggest a blueprint for other countries, especially those exploring MaaS.

Fostering trust in transport 
Trust is a high stakes issue when using personal 
data 
Trust is a high stakes issue for transport companies who rely on their ability to 
collect and use data about people, in particular journey data. While companies in 
many sectors can collect location data during a person’s journey – from banks 
and smartphone makers to telecom providers and social media – it is transport 
companies whose relationships with customers are most defined by journey data, 
and whose business models are most closely aligned with it. ​These stakes will 
likely grow higher ​as journey data is collected and used more, as more people 
think about how and why they share data, and as we ​gain more rights over data 
about us. 
 
In any sector using personal data, trust is strongest when people think, and feel, 
that an organisation uses data about them in ways that meet both their needs for 
a service and their expectations in relation to privacy and receiving a fair share of 
the benefits for data about them. People become more willing to share data about 
them and less likely to move to competitors. ​But when this trust goes, for instance 
because data is used in a misleading way, we risk a backlash taking us into a 
‘data wasteland’. In such cases, people may restrict their privacy settings, adding 
bias into what might have otherwise been useful datasets. They may also 
withdraw consent by changing service provider, by ceasing to use all providers of 
a service, or stopping sharing personal data altogether, even for the greater good. 
For transport – a universal asset which can benefit greatly from people’s 
willingness to share journey data – such a loss of trust could be detrimental to 
both transport providers and passengers.  
 
Current levels of trust in how location data is being used across a range of sectors 
should give us all pause for thought. One global consumer ​study​ by HERE 
showed only one in five people feel they have full control over data about their 
location, while 44% have shared it unintentionally and 76% feel stressed or 
vulnerable doing so. On the other hand, using journey data about a person to 
31
provide a service for them at the right time and in the right place can create trust. 
For example, interviewees reported that transport services who tell people about 
disruptions affecting their journey can help them adjust routes in real time and 
build trust in the service as a result. 
 
“ 
“(If I) manage that disruption... that makes you 
view me as a trusted partner.”  
– Stuart Walker, Arriva 
Our interviews with industry showed an interesting range of views about the role 
of trust​. Those who think of it as an abundant value to foster and grow take a 
‘show and tell’ approach, aiming to communicate and demonstrate to users the 
individual and communal benefits of sharing journey data. Others see trust more 
in terms of scarcity, as a fixed asset to preserve, and commit to not sharing any 
personal data (potentially without asking if and how users might be willing to share 
it). A third group, increasingly a minority, and now forced to change by tighter data

regulation, do not proactively communicate about data at all, but may still share or 
sell it, according to their terms and conditions. 
How tighter data protection regulation impacts 
transport businesses 
As organisations have adopted new technologies to collect and use data in new 
ways and at new scales, regulators have increasingly focused on ​how personal 
data is collected, stored and used, and how people can have more control over it. 
The most recent culmination of this trend is the GDPR, a European Union 
regulation. It applies to any company processing data about EU citizens, even 
companies based outside the EU. The GDPR creates some new rights around 
data, but mostly builds on existing rights in existing data protection regulations. 
32
 
 
Right Description Did it exist 
already? 
What are its key changes 
and elements? 
The right to 
be informed 
Organisations must give people 
‘fair processing information’ on 
the use of data about them, 
primarily through privacy notices 
Yes The information must be 
concise, transparent and 
written in clear and plain 
language 
The right of 
access  
Gives people access to  
data an organisation holds  
about them 
Yes Information must be available 
free of charge for the first 
copy, unless the request is 
‘manifestly unfounded’, and 
provided without undue delay, 
generally within one month of 
its receipt 
The right to 
data 
portability  
Lets a person obtain a copy of 
data about them to share with 
other services.  
No This is a new right under the 
GDPR. It applies in specific 
situations where data was 
processed automatically, and 
the justification for processing 
it was that the individual had 
consented to that use, such as 
loyalty card data. 
 
 
Under the GDPR, companies must also apply the principles of data protection by 
design and by default, minimising the data they collect, ensuring good governance 
of personal data processing and demonstrating compliance. In situations deemed 
high-risk, they must also carry out Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIAs). 
‘It is all about strengthening trust and updating the law to the 21st century.’  
(Garreth Cameron, The Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO)) 
 
Fines for non-compliance under the GDPR could be substantial, with businesses 
potentially liable for up to 4% of annual global turnover, or ​€20 million ​(whichever 
is higher)​. But fines are not the focus of the regulation: ​‘Thinking that GDPR is 
about crippling financial punishment misses the point... it’s about putting the 
consumer and citizen first.’ (​Elizabeth Denham, UK Information Commissioner). 
 
Most transport companies welcome the GDPR, as guidelines and benchmarks that are  
necessary to manage long-term trends in the collection and use of personal data. 
‘​There have to be actual laws that providers are accountable to in order for  
transport to remain sustainable’, says Eanna Lalor of Urbo.  
 
Many also see it as an opportunity.

“ 
 
“GDPR helps you think about the customer 
experience in more detail.”  
– Stuart Walker, Arriva 
The GDPR’s introduction of the right to ​data portability​ may also increase 
innovation​ and competition, as people can use their right to ‘port’ data about them 
to support the development of new services striving to meet their needs. For 
33
instance, a transport startup working to fill a gap in a specific location could 
prompt people in that location to share historic journey data about them by 
changing permission settings in a journey planner service they use.  
  
Some businesses may try to minimise the risk of liabilities created by the GDPR by 
collecting and using personal data less. In a sector increasingly reliant on real time 
data from networks and users, this could reduce customer insight, create skewed 
datasets and erode the quality of a company’s services over time. Trying to 
minimise a legal risk could create a greater, more strategic business risk. 
Beyond regulation – ethics, equity, engagement 
The more an organisation needs personal data, the more it needs to change how it 
manages risk. The complex issues raised by the commercial use of personal data 
need to be assessed and managed proactively and consistently across a 
company’s business model, user experience and communication. Risks which 
might have been considered reputational, ancillary, or both in the past become 
strategic and operational, changing how a company makes decisions. To manage 
this, organisations need decision-making frameworks that support innovation and 
are guided by three core principles of ​ethics, equity and engagement.  
 
1. Organisations and people must use data ethically  
To earn trust it is vital that organisations and people do not collect, use or 
share data about people in unfair, discriminatory or misleading ways.  
 
2. Organisations must support equitable access to, and benefits from, 
data  
This promotes fair competition, informed markets, and empowers people 
as citizens, creators and consumers.  
 
3. Organisations must engage with people to make data work for all 
To help meet the needs of all communities, organisations must 
communicate clearly and work collaboratively with them. 
 
1. Using data ethically 
Trust and ethics are inseparable – to earn trust, organisations must act ethically. A 
decision can be lawful but still be unethical. Ethics is knowing the difference 
between what you have a right to do and what is right to do (a line sometimes 
attributed to US Supreme Court Justice Potter Stewart). The ethical issues raised 
by the use of personal data are complex, and as a result some businesses are 
exploring the rapidly emerging discipline of data ethics. These businesses see the 
GDPR as a stepping stone to this.

innovation?’, ​https://theodi.org/article/will-gdpr-and-data-portability-support-innovation 
Open Data Institute 2018 Personal data in transport: exploring a framework for the future16 

“ 
 
“We really see GDPR as being the baseline and 
very much the minimum that has to be done... 
We want to take it a step further not just with 
ticking the boxes but by using our data in an 
ethical manner.”  
–​ ​Eanna Lalor, Urbo 
 
In transport, the potential ethical issues raised by the use of personal data are 
many and highly complex. In particular, more discussion is urgently needed about 
what users expect from new mobility services, and the appropriate ways to use 
and share data about them. 
 
For instance, one ​study​ of rideshare services analysed cancellation rates and wait 
times to suggest some drivers were discriminating against passengers based on 
the perceived race or gender of the user profiles provided by rideshare services. 
34
The study also noted some female passengers were taken on longer trips. ​Should 
a driver using their own car to offer trips via a rideshare service be given 
information about race and gender before being given the option to cancel a trip? 
And if drivers’ cancellations of a certain group make customer demand from that 
group appear lower than it is, would this bias future innovation using rideshare 
services’ journey datasets? For instance, would it encourage investment in 
services for groups less discriminated against, because their customer demand 
appears proportionally greater than it is? (This is as much a question of equity as 
ethics, a reminder of how closely the two principles can relate). 
 
There are also urgent ethical questions around the potential for data to be used in 
misleading ways. Commentators like the ​Data Society​ have asked how the use of 
crowdsourced traffic data can impact drivers in potentially misleading ways, for 
instance if services recommend under-tested routes to gain more data about road 
conditions. This issue was taken to tragic extremes when a person’s death in 
35
Niteroi, Brazil was ​attributed to misdirection​ caused by street names. How can 
36
services accessed while people are focused on activities such as driving ensure 
they are not misleading? ​Even if a driver is not being misled, is it right to be given 
the option to use an under-tested route in exchange for a free service?  
 
2. Supporting equitable access to and benefits from data 
Transport is a global need and a universal asset, so it is critical that data is used in 
ways that meet the transport needs of everyone. 
Some groups of people and modes of transport are now intensively monitored and 
measured, and data about them can be used to strengthen the case for investment 
in infrastructure, subsidies or innovation. On the other hand, because of the ways 
journey data is collected, there are groups we have little or no data about who are 
increasingly at risk of being excluded from such decision-making processes. These

‘data wastelands’ can in turn mean businesses miss opportunities to develop new 
services or enter new markets. 
 
Groups of people most at risk of being overlooked include those who: 
 
●cannot access transport (for example wheelchair users, or people in rural 
areas without transport) 
●pay in cash for transport (including those who use cash-only taxis or buses) 
●do not use monitored transport (for example walkers and runners who don’t 
use fitness trackers and are outside connected city centres) 
●are ​digitally​ and/or ​financially​ excluded (for example the very young or old) 
●choose not to share data about themselves 
 
This raises important questions about how data can harm, as well as help. For 
instance, how will a lack of data on walkers and runners relative to other more 
resource-intensive modes of transport impact the development of our transport and 
cities over time? Will transport be skewed to deliver more resource-intensive modes 
of transport because there is more data about users of those services? Will it be 
harder to make a case for low carbon services and support ​active mobility​? 
 
Potholes offer another opportunity to think about the problem of data wastelands. 
New mobility services for cyclists such as ​See.sense​ lights and ​Blubel​ navigators 
collect data on potholes from users and share it with local authorities, either for free 
or paid for as a service. Will this make local authorities prioritise the needs of 
37
those cyclists who can afford this equipment and share pothole data over other 
people who use roads? Or will it help local authorities redirect the time and 
resources saved through this new service into collecting other data to help make 
better decisions about pothole repairs overall? 
 
The example of people who choose not to share data about them raises policy 
issues around personal choice which need to be explored. As new mobility services 
integrate more with public transport, should there be options for people who do not 
want data about them to be stored or used? (Some smart ticketing services offer 
unregistered or anonymous versions which offer fewer benefits than cards which 
are personalised to one user). ​It could even be a question of free will. Can you still 
use transport without choosing to share data at all? If the answer is no, it is not a 
genuine choice, so simply asking for ​consent​ could be considered misleading. 
38
 
Societal debates and democratic decisions help determine the choices that citizens 
and consumers can make or, to put it another way, the sets of individual user needs 
that will be met. If societies determine that they want consumers to have access to 
a range of transport services that can be used without sharing personal data but 
market forces do not lead to the emergence of these services then it may take 
government intervention to make it happen.

Rural mobility: ​an overlooked opportunity? 
 
In rural communities, a person’s independence is closely linked to their ​access 
to transport​, but to date new mobility services have done little to meet these 
critical travel needs. This lack of rural mobility services relative to cities is 
39
effectively creating journey data wastelands in many areas. Left unchanged, 
this risks limiting innovation in rural transport even further. 
 
To date, new mobility services have focused most on cities, which offer more 
of the infrastructure these services need to work, and are big, ​growing 
markets. This makes sense for a startup, but once a service is established it is 
important it extends outside urban areas where possible. This supports equity 
in transport and helps businesses access markets to meet the needs of the 
growing number of commuters who cross both rural and urban areas. 
 
Journey data could play a critical role in improving rural transport. Historically, 
one of the obstacles to developing rural transport was the cost of running it – 
operations in less densely populated areas need to cover more miles for fewer 
people. Journey data can help organisations understand demand more, 
making services more feasible and viable.  
 
Some organisations are exploring opportunities like this. For instance, in the 
UK, ​Arriva​ operates smart buses in Kent. ​Ride​’s smart bus service in Essex 
and Suffolk is a FutureGov partnership with local authorities (see Smart Buses 
in the UK case study). Community led groups like ​Western Dales Buses​ also 
play a valuable role in meeting the needs of some local communities, but most 
do not collect journey data. 
 
Public sector initiatives may also help reduce rural data wastelands. For 
example, a ​government investment​ to introduce smart ticketing across 
England and Wales will give train operators the ability to collect more journey 
data. This could be used to support better investment and planning in rail 
40
infrastructure and services. With appropriate anonymisation and consent, it 
could be linked with other data to help understand the overarching travel 
needs of people in rural areas beyond trains alone.  
 
While some journey planners only cover cities, Google Maps can collect 
journey data in rural areas, and offers suggested routes across large distances, 
including some public transport. Could such rural journey data be aggregated 
to develop overarching multimodal views of rural travel needs?  
 
MaaS services could also play a valuable role in meeting rural travel needs. For 
example, ​Navigogo​ is working with 16-25 year olds to design and test a new 
service in Dundee and North East Fife, Scotland. This collaborative initiative 
41
aims to give young people personalised travel data across multiple modes of 
transport, such as walking, buses, trains, taxis, car clubs and bike schemes, 
and offer concessions and discounts in a single payment process.

3. Engaging to make data work for all 
 
Organisations who encourage people to share data about them must earn trust by 
making good on their word. They should do this by ensuring their commercial and 
communications strategies for how they collect and use personal data match up. 
Companies who let gaps grow between the two, or who are opaque about the 
benefits of personal data to the business itself, can create strategic risks around 
trust that business models using personal data cannot afford.  
 
People currently feel poorly informed about how personal data is being used. A 
DotEveryone ​survey​ of people in the UK found that 70% recognise that a service 
they share personal data with can use it to target advertising, but only 56% know 
that the data can be sold to other companies. ​And​ while 94% of people said it is 
important to be able to choose how much data they share with companies and 
know how that data is used, half of them do not know how to do this.  
42
For location data specifically, the findings are even more troubling. The global 
survey​ by HERE mentioned earlier in this report found that 80% of consumers are 
not clear about why location data about them is needed most of the time, what it 
is used for, where it is stored, and which third parties have access to it.  
To address these issues and risks, businesses are encouraged to think more 
holistically about engagement, exploring ways to explain their business models, 
how data about people is collected, used and stored, and the benefits and 
trade-offs involved in clear and relevant ways. People can understand the 
fundamentals of how a system works when given the relevant information 
(systems thinker Donella Meadows used the example of a ​bathtub​ to show this). 
43
This sort of communication can help users make informed choices, either as 
individuals, or with the support of third parties like ​data representatives.

TOC Ability 
Using personal data to improve equality in transport in the UK 
 
The spending power of households with people with disabilities in the UK is 
£250 billion​, but businesses often miss opportunities to deliver services for 
this group. 9% of adults have difficulty with mobility, but represent only 5% 
45
of train users, put off by ​poor accessibility​ at stations and during journeys. 
46
 
To address this market failure, Stratford-upon-Avon intelligent mobility 
startup ​Enable ID​ is piloting ​TOC Ability. The startup is using a collaborative 
47
and iterative process to design and test the service. It involves a panel of 
people with disabilities, Transport for London, Arriva, Loughborough 
University (providing customer experience expertise), the University of 
Surrey’s cyber security experts, and other groups. 
 
Tests will run at sites including Wembley Central and Harrow & Wealdstone 
(London Underground), Willesden Junction and Carpenders Park (London 
Overground), and other stations outside London. 
 
In particular, the pilot will test the feasibility of a data hub which delivers 
better rail services to passengers with accessibility needs by sharing real time 
data about them with Train Operating Companies (TOCs), journey planners, 
bus and taxi firms, and even non-transport services like food retailers and 
chemists.  
 
To provide these services viably, the hub will help TOCs track and balance 
the profitability of providing these services alongside the related costs of 
running them. To support trust in the service, the hub will include a consent 
management system to give users control over data about them, including 
how it is used and shared. 
 
How could an approach such as the one being used by TOC Ability be 
applied to test ways to increase accessibility and improve user experience for 
other groups with specific travel needs?

How transport uses data  
 
This section looks at some major land transport for people, outlining how they 
collect and use data, particularly journey data. We do not aim to give a 
comprehensive global view covering all types of transport – instead we hope to 
give an overview of some key stakeholders in interconnected transport systems.  
 
We have been struck by two observations while doing this. Firstly, categories in 
this innovative sector are not clear cut. For this report, we look at modes of 
transport (often thought of as operations) and new ways of accessing transport 
(often called services), but the two constantly overlap. For example, buses are a 
mode of transport that may also use digital services to give people new ways to 
access their operations. A bikeshare service is a new way of accessing transport 
that runs physical operations to enable that new form of access. A journey planner 
is a new service for sharing data about multiple modes of transport that can also 
use that data to develop physical operations in different modes of transport. 
 
Our second observation is that new mobility services tend to collect and use 
journey data far more than established public transport operations. If this trend 
continues it could create imbalances in our transport systems, perhaps even 
oligopolies or monopolies, in the form of journey data for specific locations. There 
are private companies and public services already exploring ways, often 
collaboratively, to address these imbalances and make data more open, and these 
efforts must continue to ensure transport systems serve the needs of everyone. 
 
 
Trains 
 
Historically, intercity rail operators collected little personal data, focusing instead 
on the technologies and data required to validate payments and prevent ticket 
fraud. However, as new mobility services and other sectors show the benefits of 
personal data, train operators are exploring ways to collect and use it. 
 
In a growing numbers of places, such as Europe, North America and India, train 
operators are collecting personal data by asking people to create accounts before 
buying tickets online; third party retailers such as Trainline and GoEuro can do the 
same. An increasing number of train operators are also moving to mobile tickets 
and smart ticketing. Many train operators can also collect personal data through 
wifi logins offered onboard (wifi providers can collect it too). All this data can be 
used to improve core operations, customer service and complementary services.  
 
Many train operators still don’t know when specific people board specific trains, 
because cash payments and paper tickets transferable between people or trains 
remain common. This is changing as countries like Finland, Holland, Germany, 
France and the UK use more mobile tickets and smart tickets. Ticket barriers or 
onboard staff can scan these tickets to collect real time journey data linked to 
individuals. Even in these situations, it can still be hard to complete journey data, 
as tickets are not always scanned at the end of journeys, and passengers may get 
off at a station not reflected in their original ticket purchase. 
 
The UK government’s investment in rail smart ticketing across England and Wales 
mentioned earlier in this report will give train operators the ability to collect more 
accurate journey data and may encourage them to think more about how they use 
it and other personal data. Operators could find ways to increase engagement 
with customers and address service gaps, for instance by combining appropriately 
anonymised journey data with other data to understand overcrowding beyond 
simple counts. Done ethically, this could help reduce overcrowding and pressure 
on infrastructure by helping train operators understand what trade-offs individuals 
might make to adjust when they travel to help the system and themselves. 
 
Open Data Institute 2018 Personal data in transport: exploring a framework for the future22 

 
Buses  
 
Buses, like trains, have historically collected little data and are working to change 
this. Bus services and their oversight are generally more fragmented than trains, 
particularly outside major cities. This fragmentation can make it harder for individual 
organisations to collect data at the scales needed to deliver benefits, and reduce 
investment in data as a result. Access to more open data infrastructure, perhaps 
including safely and securely shared journey data, could help address this issue.  
 
The UK’s highly fragmented and ​shrinking bus network​ is a case in point. There is 
48
currently no consistent way for private sector operators of buses to share 
timetables and fare data with public sector operators of bus lanes and bus stops. 
This makes it hard for people to get the data they need, potentially making them 
less likely to trust and use buses. Bus operators’ smart cards, which can collect 
customer data, are still relatively new and equally ​fragmented​, and it is unclear how 
much they are used. Even when they are used, accurate journey data can still be 
difficult to collect, as passengers may only scan or tap a smart ticket when they 
board a bus, not when they get off. As a result of all this, there is little innovation 
using data, limiting the public and private sectors’ ability to understand and serve 
people’s needs.  
 
More open transport data and engagement with local communities is not a magic 
solution but it could help overcome these obstacles and there are signs of positive 
change in these directions – the ​Bus Services Act​ requires UK bus operators to 
provide open data by 2020, and some companies are now testing ‘smart buses’.

sharing small private spaces with drivers and passengers they don’t know if it 
helps them make necessary journeys like work commutes or getting home 
late at night. Now established operators, new entrants and local councils are 
developing similar services for bigger groups in cities like Manchester, 
London and Bristol, and in rural areas like Kent, Suffolk and Essex.  
 
Often called smart buses or shared transport, these minibuses and minivans 
offer routes with pre-determined or on-demand pick-up points and 
destinations. In particular, these flexible, adaptable vehicles could help meet 
rural travel needs, improving equity in transport. 
 
The UK’s first smart bus pilot was launched by public transport operator 
Arriva in Sittingbourne, Kent. ​ArrivaClick​ collects users’ journey plans via a 
smartphone application and then maps a ‘corner-to-corner’ minibus route 
guaranteeing seats for people, including wheelchair users. The year-long pilot 
reported ​promising​ results: 12% of local residents downloaded the

http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-42749973 
Open Data Institute 2018 Personal data in transport: exploring a framework for the future23 

application, and 52% of users switched from private car transport as a result.
 
49
 
In Essex and Suffolk, ​Ride​’s on-demand bus service was started by 
FutureGov in partnership with Essex and Suffolk County Councils and the 
support of Transport Systems Catapult. In urban areas, Paris public transport 
provider RATP’s international arm, RATP Dev, developed ​Slide Bristol​ to 
deliver shared ride-to-work services in Bristol. San Francisco mobility startup 
Chariot​, bought by Ford in 2016, is running a TfL-approved pilot with fixed 
pick-up points in parts of south London. 
50
 
Citymapper is an example of a journey planner using personal data to expand 
into transport operations. It began as a London journey planner using TfL 
open data, and Google and Apple maps and platforms. It combined this data 
with users’ journey data to build an algorithm called ‘​Simcity​’. Simcity 
analysed demand for routes, mapped it over existing public transport routes 
to identify gaps, and forecast how new routes might change how people 
travelled. A ​smart bus pilot​ tested these insights and collected customer 
feedback. A late-night ​Smart Ride​ service launched as a result, and 
Citymapper shares ​open data​ on it. Now TfL, Google and Apple display 
51
Citymapper’s service in their applications, as well as vice versa.  
 
Some people argue that bus networks must remain fundamentally public to 
ensure infrastructure is built for all, including people less able to pay or 
persuade. Others say that the private sector should play a role developing 
business models to fill public service gaps. 
 
Cars 
 
Since the 1990s, most cars have automatically collected location, speed, emissions 
and other data via event data recorders and diagnostics systems installed directly in 
cars. This data could usually only be retrieved via physical access to the car. It was 
used by car makers to measure and improve safety and performance in car models, 
and by mechanics to find and fix issues in specific cars. Car owners can now also 
connect devices such as smartphones or telematics ‘black boxes’ to their cars. 
These devices can collect and share journey data and other data with third parties 
who use it to provide services such as navigation, insurance and entertainment.  
 
As a result, cars collect large amounts of data – ​25Gb of data an hour​, likely to grow 
to ​4 terabytes​ with self-driving cars. This includes a lot of ​personal data​ linked to 
52
many people and interested parties. (Connected cars help demonstrate why ​no 
53
one owns data). In future, autonomous cars could even collect personal data that 
54
is ​emotional​ and physical, like heart rate, facial expression and voice analysis.  
As cars become more autonomous, people will be able to rent them as they need 
them for specific journeys between places, improving end-to-end mobility. This

rental model will mean cars are more likely to be owned by governments or 
businesses than people. It will become more important that people know how data 
about them is collected and used, and that they trust the organisations that do this.  
 
Making data from cars as open as possible could help solve many shared 
problems. Perhaps most compellingly, it could help reduce road deaths. ​94%​ of car 
crashes are due to human error. Data from cars in accidents could be anonymised 
55
and shared to help researchers and public authorities analyse and, where possible, 
fix factors causing them. This data could also be linked with other open data on 
road accidents, such as ​UK​ road safety data or ​New York​ motor vehicle collision 
data. It could also help car makers develop safer software for automated cars 
56
more quickly.  
 
Accidents could also be reduced by sharing data including journey data between 
cars or with transport infrastructure. The EU’s ​C-Roads​ project and the Nevada 
Center for Advanced Mobility’s ​partnership​ with Nexar are testing ways to create 
these vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) networks. They 
57
could also use this data to reduce traffic and improve real time road management, 
as well as help make roads more suitable for self-driving cars.  
 
When an accident occurs, telematics insurers can already use a customer’s location 
data to get help there ​quickly​. Telematics insurers collect data from boxes installed 
in customers’ cars or via their smartphones and use the data to personalise 
insurance premiums. This can make insurance more affordable for drivers in higher 
risk groups, such as young drivers, if they are better-than-average. Businesses can 
also use this data to identify insurance fraud. Many telematics algorithms are not 
transparent in how they track and measure driving patterns, and should explain to 
customers how data about them is being used and the benefits it can create. More 
clarity is also needed on how the data they collect can be ​shared.  
58
 
There are many other ways cars sharing data could help solve problems. ​Flourish​ is 
exploring ways both connected and autonomous vehicles might help address the 
mobility needs of ​older people​ in the UK. Connected cars could share anonymised 
59
location data to help maintain open mapping data which benefits all drivers, or help 
make open address registers more accurate by sharing missing data with them. 
 
Given the amount of personal data cars can collect, and the number of 
organisations who can use it, it is critical privacy is considered and protected at all 
times. Major car makers like Volvo, Ford, Nissan and BMW have signed up to the 
Privacy Principles for Vehicle Technologies and Services. One name not 
60
mentioned is Tesla, who some ​commentators​ have criticised for how it shares data 
about people. As cars use more data themselves, ​car hacking​ will also become a 
61
growing risk and increase organisations’ focus on the security of all data.

Ridesharing 
 
While most traditional taxis remain data-poor, ridesharing services are built on data. 
Companies like Uber and Lyft collect journey data, user ratings, contact and bank 
details for both passengers and drivers, to connect them on-demand and manage 
payments between them. These mobility services can also link this data with other 
data to understand customers more and develop adjacent services, such as ​food 
deliveries. They may also sell this data to third parties.  
63
 
These popular services have met travel needs and created jobs in cities around the 
world. They have helped people meet their last mile travel needs, and made things 
easier for people who can’t access a car or public transport, or whose travel needs 
cannot be met by public transport. All this benefits people who can afford to pay for 
such services, but it does not assist people who cannot. It is critical that the impact 
of these new services does not reduce equal access to transport over time. 
 
These fast-growing mobility services have also highlighted the need to make 
decisions about data which foster and earn trust at all times. Some commentators 
are concerned about how rideshare services store the large amounts of personal 
data they collect, and Uber is working to rebuild trust after concealing ​data hacks 
last year. Other commentators are concerned about the ​demands​ these services 
64
put on transport infrastructure, and debate their ​net effect​ on economies overall. 
6566
 
As a result, there is growing ​pressure​ for rideshare businesses to engage with us 
more, and make their journey data more open – ​San Francisco​ even compelled it. 
67
Now, ​Uber Movement​ shares ​aggregated, anonymised data​ for Paris, Sydney and 
other cities to help policy makers understand and meet urban mobility needs. 
68
Several ridesharing services have also signed Zipcar co-founder Robin Chase’s 
Shared Mobility Principles for Livable Cities​, supporting collaboration and open data 
to develop transport in the interests of all. Concepts such as ​data observatories 
69
may be one way to start turning these commitments into action and provide insights 
that help local areas make more informed decisions. 
70
 
If rideshare services continue to grow, the imperative to share insights such as 
usage data will grow with it. The speed of adoption of these new services, 
combined with ongoing poor data collection in some public transport, could create 
journey data monopolies, for instance in cities where fragmented bus services not 
collecting data compete with a single ridesharing service. This asymmetry between 
public and private operators could limit the ability of public services to invest and 
innovate over time, and be exacerbated as public transport data continues to 
become more open. For example, the Bus Services Act in the UK mandates smart 
buses with a bus operating license to provide open data by 2020, whereas 
rideshare services which can effectively compete with them but operate under a 
private hire license are not required to do the same.

Bikesharing 
 
Bikesharing has great potential to support the travel needs of urban populations 
and has been ​embraced by people in cities around the world. In the UK alone, 20 
71
bikeshare operators have launched in 10 years. These services let people who can 
cycle travel more flexibly and actively while reducing congestion and pollution.  
 
Docked and dockless services like ​Urbo​, ​obike​ and ​ofo use applications and bank 
72
cards to collect account and bank details as well as some journey data. Operators 
collect GPS data directly from bikes to locate and move them to match customer 
demand. Some also collect journey data from users, via a smartphone or connected 
device linking them to the bike, sharing that data with the user, and sometimes 
selling it to third parties.  
 
Some bikeshare services are exploring ways of sharing data that help urban 
planners make better planning and investment decisions. For instance, Urbo aims 
to work with local authorities whenever they enter a new city. Services increasingly 
share usage data with local authorities, and it is now often a condition for dockless 
services seeking local authority consent.  
 
“ 
 
“We always open a line of dialogue with the 
government and local council... it’s very much 
a collaborative relationship”  
–​ ​Eanna Lalor, Urbo 
Some bikeshare services are working to increase accessibility for excluded groups. 
For example, ​Germany’s Nextbike service can be accessed via an RFID card 
bought in shops, to give access to people with no smartphone or bank card. 
Hourbike offers electric bikes in some locations, to give access to those less able to 
cycle.  
 
Open standards and industry bodies are helping these services share more data 
and in ethical and equitable ways. The ​General Bikeshare Feed Specification, 
started in the US, is a new operator-led standard for sharing real time data on bike 
availability from different services. It increases accessibility to bikeshare services by 
helping journey planners include them in their applications, and improves urban 
planners’ decision-making by giving them aggregated mobility patterns.  
 
Industry groups are also emerging to help these new services engage with key 
stakeholders in the public and private sectors, including large employers and 
community groups. For example, ​Bikeplus​, the representative body for bikeshare 
services in the UK, analyses and shares data and works to ensure social and 
environmental benefits are maximised and evenly spread.  
73
 
 
Journey planners  
 
Journey planners are growing in popularity around the world, transforming how we 
access and analyse transport ecosystems. Applications like Google Maps, Moovit 
and Citymapper, typically accessed via smartphones, combine transport data from 
many modes of transport with maps to help people choose and monitor trips from 
and to precise locations. This makes them ‘end-to-end’ and ‘multimodal’ services.

Users can give these applications permission to collect journey data, anonymously 
or linked with other data about them. As well as helping to plan journeys, it can help 
users track other things, such as distances travelled, calories burned or money 
saved. It can also help improve the accuracy of the application’s data for all users, 
and help the application itself develop other services, such as data analytics for 
public and private mobility providers, or new transport operations. 
 
Moovit crowdsources data from users to ​plot public transport stations and routes in 
cities with little or no open transport data. This helps people in those cities access 
and engage with public transport more easily, and those cities can ​license​ ​this 
information to improve their data infrastructure. Citymapper encourages cities to 
74
partner with it to develop open data, and also uses the journey data it collects to 
identify and fill gaps in transport services (see Smart Buses in the UK case study). 
 
The benefit of open data infrastructure to these companies has influenced how they 
communicate. They strive to explain the different ways and value of sharing data to 
users, building communities and making the ‘greater good’ part of their service and 
ethos. This can increase people’s engagement as they are motivated to help 
improve a system for the benefit of others as well as themselves. Companies with 
this type of engagement and business models that back it up foster and earn trust. 
 
Journey planners have real time network views of how people move through 
transport ecosystems. These overarching views could be of great value to public 
services that often provided the open transport data which helped these private 
services start. For instance, Moovit’s ​public transit index​ shares anonymised and 
aggregated data on how people experience public transport in cities around the 
world, from wait times, to number of changes in a single journey and the average 
length of a commute.  
75
 
Further exploration of such sharing is encouraged, particularly where it could help 
public transport fill service gaps that private companies have identified but can’t or 
won’t fill themselves. If MaaS develops to position journey planners as centralised 
gateways into our transport ecosystems, it will also be important their displays 
continue to enable innovation by supporting awareness of and enabling access to 
new mobility services as they emerge, using open APIs.  
 
 
 
Case studies for the future 
 
Digital Matatus 
Collecting journey data for open data infrastructure in informal transport 
systems 
 
Nairobi’s ​Digital Matatus​ was the first group to develop open data 
infrastructure for the ​informal transport systems​ common in cities across 
Africa, Asia and Latin America. The University of Nairobi’s ​C4D Lab​, MIT’s 
76
Civic Data Design Lab​ and Boston design agency Groupshot collaborated to 
map the city’s network of ​matatus​, privately-owned minibuses used by most 
Nairobi residents.  
77
 
To do this, university students collected journey data using mobile phones 
and GPS technology. They identified routes and stops, as well as fares, all of 
which can vary journey to journey. To standardise and open the data, they

Open Data Institute 2018 Personal data in transport: exploring a framework for the future28 

asked Google to help them modify the GTFS open standard, built for formal 
transport systems with fixed routes and stops, to fit informal transport 
systems with a lot of variable data.  
 
The group used the data to publish route maps in both digital and paper form. 
Because the data was standardised using GTFS, Google and OpenStreetMap 
could also include the routes in their maps. Making the routes visible and 
accessible helped passengers save time by finding routes to meet their travel 
needs easily. It also changed travel experiences, for instance helping women 
feel ​safer​ at night.  
78
 
Making the data open and easy to use allowed others to create further 
benefits. Matatu drivers could see underserved areas and try new routes. 
Third-party developers used the data to create new applications such as 
ma3route​, which crowdsources location and other data to provide updates on 
traffic and driving conditions. New mobility services like this also expanded 
79
the city’s transport ecosystem to include its technology community. The data 
can also support transport planning to help combat the estimated $1 billion 
Nairobi losses a year to ​wasted gridlock hours. 
80
 
Similar initiatives are also running in ​Manila​, ​Accra​, ​Dhaka​ and ​Mexico City. 
81
Linking resources and skills across cities, ​Digital Transport 4 Africa​ is a 
collaborative initiative using open data to improve urban transport throughout 
Africa. Could learnings from these initiatives also be applied to cities with 
82
more formal public transport where frequent journeys via new mobility 
services may be evolving into informal transport systems? 
 
 
Smart ticketing  
 
Ticketing is a core function of any transport system and has changed significantly in 
recent years. Many public transport operators have moved from paper to magnetic 
tickets, then barcodes, and now mobile ticketing, smart cards and contactless 
payments. These new technologies have simplified travel for people and allowed 
transport operators to collect journey data and use it to make better planning and 
investment decisions, as well as lower the cost of their ticketing solutions.  
 
Smart cards​ using RFID and NFC technology let passengers in cities such as Hong 
Kong, Sydney, Stockholm and London access services across multiple modes of 
transport with a single card. In London, people can use contactless bank cards. 
83
Other cities, such as Oslo and Helsinki, focus on mobile ticketing and smartphones. 
 
While many rural communities do not yet have access to smart ticketing, some 
countries have moved to a national ticketing platform that can be used in urban and 
rural area and for all modes of public transport. This solution is seen, for example, in

The Netherlands via OV-Chipkaart and in Denmark via Rejsekort. These systems are 
spreading the benefits of smart ticketing more equitably and could provide rich 
journey datasets to help policy makers make better planning and investment 
decisions at a national level. Some systems, such as OV-Chipkaart, let users 
choose between an ​anonymous​ version of the card, which does not store personal 
data, and a ​personal​ version which does, and offers benefits as a result.  
84
 
Smart cards dedicated to specific groups of people can also help public services 
ensure their travel needs are met. In the UK, ​West Yorkshire​ used journey data 
collected on Senior Pass smart cards to see how people over 60 use buses there. 
85
 
Smart ticketing also means smartphone makers and banks are now part of our 
transport infrastructure. Smartphones have helped new mobility services to emerge 
and enabled the collection and sharing of real time data. Smartphone makers can 
already collect large amounts of location data from users, storing or using it in 
different ways. If bank cards become a common form of ticketing, they can also 
build large journey datasets and link it with other data. It is paramount that 
organisations with such large amounts of personal data use it ethically and 
equitably at all times, and in ways users can understand.

Open Data Institute 2018 Personal data in transport: exploring a framework for the future30 

A framework for the future 
Data-enabled transport must combine innovation with ethics in 
open ways that build trust 
The future value of transport to our societies and economies is much more than 
financial. Quantifying the potential of data-enabled transport can yield some striking 
results: as noted earlier, intelligent mobility may be worth ​£900bn​ by 2025; not 
sharing transport data may cost an economy like the UK ​£15bn​. But it is how 
transport can change our lives and how we feel, its qualitative value, and 
businesses’ reliance on access to data about us to make this possible, that makes 
the need for an approach to data in transport that combines openness and 
innovation with ethics and trust so urgent and great.  
 
As shown earlier, personal data like journey data can help transport organisations 
be more efficient by understanding and meeting travel needs in more targeted 
ways. This can change our ​quality of life​ – better transport can help us live longer, 
sleep more, even divorce less. It can also affect how we feel – when transport 
86
gives us a greater sense of control it can increase our feelings of ​independence​ or 
happiness.  
87
 
Businesses can build sustainable models delivering these services by being more 
open, as well as fostering and earning the trust of people who share data about 
them. As services like journey planners and bikesharing show, businesses can in 
turn make the data infrastructure they build more open to support the public 
transport infrastructure and interoperability they need to continue to operate and 
innovate. This can help make transport better for everyone and gain people’s trust 
while also raising awareness of a business’s services with potential customers. 
 
This sharing in all directions and the innovation and trust it can foster is core to how 
transport works. Public and private transport services operate interdependently as a 
person’s single journey will often involve several modes of transport. New mobility 
services innovate using data made openly accessible by public services which have 
a special mandate to serve the public good. New businesses like ridesharing and 
bikesharing find innovative ways to share resources, and can help public services 
and accredited researchers better understand people’s travel needs. In areas with 
less public transport, private transport services can even help create foundations for 
data infrastructure which leads to new physical infrastructure (see the Digital 
Matatus case study). In transport, a more open approach can create value for all. 
 
Contrast this with the HERE ​survey​ noted earlier which found that while nearly 70% 
of us will share location data if we feel in control, only 20% currently feel that way, 
and 80% of us feel nervous or vulnerable. A loss of trust is bad for any business, 
but for consumer-facing groups using personal data, the risk can be far more than 
reputational and the cost material. For example, research suggests ​5%​ of Facebook 
users deleted their account in just the first few weeks of the Cambridge Analytica 
crisis. As new services become more commoditised, and as data about people 
88
becomes more portable, these risks and costs for businesses using personal data

Open Data Institute 2018 Personal data in transport: exploring a framework for the future31 

are likely to go up, not down.  
Some may assume that the compelling nature of their service makes a loss of trust 
affordable in the short term, others that the cost of a loss of trust is low anyway 
because customers get hooked to convenience. Even if both of these assumptions 
are true when tested, shareholders with long-term investment targets and ESG 
(environmental, social and governance) mandates are unlikely to tolerate them. And 
if customers and shareholders do nothing, regulators will intervene on their behalf.  
 
Similarly, as personal data becomes part of business models, commercial 
imperatives and social responsibilities are harder to separate. An ‘us versus them’ 
approach can ​erode trust​ when exposed. And for a universal need such as 
89
transport, how personal data is used and shared affects employees and investors 
just as it does customers. A large-scale loss of trust can create ​losses for all​, 
through increased ​risk-aversion​, ​social instability​ and even ​violence. 
90
 
For these reasons, we urge transport businesses who use personal data to become 
more open and build trust now. Doing so will both reduce business risks and 
increase growth opportunities. 
Recommendations 
 
1. Use existing open transport data to get a competitive edge 
 
This additional insight at low cost can ​support internal decision-making, improve 
your operations and​ help your organisation engage with and lead sector change. 
 
Actions could include: 
 
●using third-party sources of data in your internal processes 
●combining your data with other data from public services, other 
businesses or community groups 
●engaging with existing external groups enabling open data for transport. 
 
Businesses hoping to gain a competitive edge in this way can ​explore​ open 
transport data provided by governments, public transport operators and open 
data groups, or on platforms like ​GitHub​. Examples of existing sector initiatives 
91
at the national level include the UK’s ​Transport Systems Catapult​ and Belgium’s 
Intelligent Transport Systems​. Broader alliances include ​Digital Transport 4 Africa 
and ​Open Transport Net.  
92
 
 
2. Turn your transport data into infrastructure that can benefit all 
 
This can let other organisations integrate your transport services with theirs, help  
people access your services more easily, and inform decision-making for public 
transport infrastructure. It can also help your teams collaborate more internally.

For instance: 
 
●Adopt existing open standards and create open APIs that help your 
services integrate into journey planners and public planning processes 
●Find other groups with a common or adjacent need that can be addressed 
using data and partner with them to build new data infrastructure 
●Identify data you manage anyway that could be shared or made open 
safely and at low cost to benefit customers or public services 
 
See how ​TransportAPI​ and ​Navitia.io​ use open APIs in transport, how ​Thomson 
93
Reuters​ has built open infrastructure for and with its customers, and an idea for 
94
how location data could be shared with local authorities to ​improve air quality.

CRITICAL QUESTIONS 
What does ‘as open as possible’ mean for journey data? 
 
Making data as open as possible can create benefits for all, and as open 
as possible means different things when dealing with different data. For 
personal data, a balance must be struck between the benefits of providing 
access to data – and individuals’ rights to privacy and being protected 
from harm. It means this data can only be shared in very safe ways and, if 
the person it is about has not consented, not at all. Only in very rare cases 
– such as politicians’ expenses – should identifiable personal data be 
open for everyone to access and use.  
 
Developing ways to share journey data safely and securely and in 
ways that foster trust with people will be hard, but we encourage 
transport organisations to explore doing it in three ways:  
 
1. As open data​ – with careful and appropriate aggregation and 
anonymisation, and accompanied by privacy impact assessments  
 
2. In secure environments​ – in particular with accredited researchers, 
who should openly publish their results  
 
3. With people the data is about​ – through open APIs, in ways that  
enable innovation  
 
There are several examples of ways this can be done in transport and  
other sectors. For instance, Transport for London makes network 
statistics  
such as Oyster card journey data ​open​ to support innovation, while Uber  
96
Movement makes anonymised and aggregated journey data ​open​ to help  
urban planning. ​Open banking​ in the UK is using open APIs to give  
97
customers more control over data about them, and Projects by IF have  
98
explored other ​prototypes​ for open APIs using personal data.

3. Use impetus from the GDPR to drive data literacy and ethics 
  
This can differentiate your business from others and build customer loyalty. It can 
also help your teams make more informed decisions, and help your organisation 
stay ahead of further potential regulation on the use of personal data. 
 
Consider: 
 
●going beyond technical and regulatory requirements to develop 
governance guidelines and processes for the collection and use of 
personal data which give people more control over data about them 
●providing training and resources to support different levels of data literacy 
across your technology, strategy, operations, marketing and other teams 
●generating debate and discussion, internally and externally, about the use 
of personal data and exploring different ways to use and store it 
 
The ​Data Ethics Canvas​ developed by the ODI can help identify, debate and 
address issues around how data is used by your organisation. ​Co-op​ is using 
100
the GDPR to drive a broader debate on the use of personal data. ​Caution Your 
101
Blast​ and ​Birmingham City Council​ have piloted a journey planner that stores 
personal data differently. 
102
 
 
CRITICAL QUESTIONS 
What’s next in the regulation of personal data? 
 
The GDPR is one of the most comprehensive pieces of regulation yet to 
deal with personal data and will likely lead to more regulation in future, 
both from the EU and individual countries. Just as technology can evolve 
quickly and policy discussions around the use of personal data can move 
fast, so organisations have a better chance of informing and being 
prepared for further regulatory change if they engage in public debate.  
 
Potential focuses of future regulation may be ​group privacy​ and actions 
103
(while the GDPR allows group actions, national laws like the UK’s Data 
Protection Bill ​do not​), inspection measures and ​conditions around when 
(if at all) people can sell data about them. Authorities like the UK’s ICO are 
also likely to make new recommendations about how personal data can be 
used in light of issues around Facebook and Cambridge Analytica. ​In 
future​, businesses may also be able to use data protection sandboxes to 
develop new services in a way regulators can assess as they emerge. 
104
 
 
4. Engage openly with people on how data is collected and used 
 
This can let your organisation show customers how you consider and care for their 
privacy needs, for instance explaining how personal data is safeguarded as well as 
when and why it is shared. This can build trust and address privacy concerns so

people continue to share data about them, and strengthen customer relationships 
more broadly.  
 
Ways to engage more openly include: 
 
●designing a user experience for your service so people know when and 
how sharing data about them creates benefits so they can make more 
informed decisions about whether or not to use the service 
●enabling more granular control over types of personal data and sharing 
●engaging with customers through surveys, focus groups and other 
feedback forums to understand what data-sharing different groups are 
comfortable with, for example urban commuters in cities with multiple 
mobility services, or remote rural communities with few transport services 
●embedding a user experience for any ​automated decision-making​ using 
personal data, in order to explain why a decision was taken. This both 
105
complies with the GDPR and builds trust with users (self-driving vehicles 
are an obvious focus here) 
●clearly telling users which, if any, third parties their personal data is shared 
with, what is shared, and how it is used. For example, a mobility service 
may need to share personal data with a bank to take payment 
●if both collecting personal data and selling it to third parties, making every 
effort to explain the trade-offs and risks to both the individuals the data is 
about and the third parties buying a product based on it. Over time this 
may even suggest a new kind of caveat emptor that is closer to ​caveat 
venditor​, ‘seller beware’, for business models that offer a free service in 
exchange for personal data, and use that personal data to sell another 
service to third parties. This type of shift in responsibility becomes more 
important the greater the asymmetry of power between buyer and seller in 
both types of transaction. 
●publishing more detailed assessments on the use of personal data in an 
accessible way, whether they are mandatory ​privacy impact or 
106
legitimate interests assessments, or voluntary ones such as the data 
107
ethics canvas mentioned earlier. 
 
See how journey planners like ​Moovit​ and ​Citymapper​ engage with users on how 
they use data. Consider the ODI’s ​openness principles for organisations handling 
personal data. Explore Projects By IF’s open source catalogue of ​design 
108
patterns for consent and sharing data. 
109
 
 
5. Use open innovation to be more efficient and equitable 
 
Opening up your data for research and development can help address your  
organisation’s specific challenges more efficiently, as well as systemic challenges  
in a wider context. It can also widen your networks and access to new ideas. The  
engagement and accessibility around open innovation, and its potential to support  
transport systems more broadly, can also support your implementation of other  
recommendations made here, by increasing your ability to capture the benefits of  
open data and building more trust with people.

●working with open data startups  
●giving academics access to their data  
●exploring new ways to collaborate with public services around data 
●getting involved with sector innovation programmes using open data 
●using data portability to help customers share data to support innovation 
 
For examples in transport, see how data accelerator ​Data Pitch​ is working with 
Deutsche Bahn ​and ​explore TfL’s ​innovation portal. Explore how GTFS began 
110111
with collaboration between public and private organisations in the US (see Open 
Standards in Transport), and expanded by partnering with academics in Kenya 
(see the Digital Matatus case study). In other sectors, see ​how ​Arup​ works with 
open data startups, how ​OpenActive.io​’s sector innovation programme is 
112
developing new ways to help people get active, and how the ​Open Up 
113
Challenge​ is using data portability in UK banking to support innovation. 
114
 
 
CRITICAL QUESTIONS 
How can re-identification risks be mitigated? 
 
Our research showed that a number of transport organisations want to share  
anonymised and aggregated journey datasets to support our transport systems  
and enable innovation, but they are very concerned about ​re-identification risks.  
115
The technical complexity of these risks was highlighted again recently when  
anonymised and aggregated open data shared by Strava was subsequently  
shown to raise concerns about ​national security.  
116
 
A lot more work needs to be done around de-identification processes and  
re-identification risks, and there are initiatives organisations can join now 
to help do this. For example, the ​UK Anonymisation Network​ has set out an  
anonymisation decision-making framework which can be adopted alongside  
117
techniques from the ICO’s ​Anonymisation Code of Practice. In the US, the  
118
Future of Privacy Forum has developed an ​assessment​ model for preserving  
privacy in open data and suggested strategies to mitigate re-identification risks. 
119
 
More must be done to reduce these risks to preserve trust in services using  
journey data and to enable open data that can make transport better for all. 
 
 
6. A collaborative approach to transport data could benefit the sector 
 
Sharing insights and resources across the sector can maximise the benefits of 
transport data for our economies and societies, ​reduce costs and risks for individual 
companies, and build public trust. 
Transport businesses can pilot working together around shared technical problems 
such as re-identification risks, around more complex and ultimately philosophical

issues like informed consent, or campaigns raising public awareness of and trust in 
the collection and use of data. 
 
These organisations can also collaborate locally, nationally or even globally, for 
instance joining initiatives mentioned earlier like the UK’s Transport Systems 
Catapult. Organisations can also collaborate within a single mode of transport or 
type of mobility service, like Bikeplus in the UK, or as a multimodal group such as 
the ​MaaS Alliance. These different groups can then share knowledge or 
120
coordinate around broader shared problems relevant to them all as they emerge.  
 
Such collaborative groups can also more effectively engage other stakeholders, like:  
 
●public bodies responsible for transport policy, infrastructure and regulation  
●civic society, consumer rights and other groups representing passengers  
●newer stakeholders in transport like smartphone makers and banks 
●open data and personal data experts 
 
Sector-wide groups can also drive change programmes by creating a forum to:  
 
●develop, advocate and measure transport-wide data strategies 
●give guidance on best practices in transport data governance 
●r​esearch the role of and impact of journey data and other data in transport 
●standardise open data protocols for transport and provide tools for their use  
●facilitate data training via face-to-face workshops, eLearning and webinars 
●run competitions and accelerators for data-enabled innovation in transport

Appendix: Methodology 
 
For this research, we commissioned the TravelSpirit Foundation to produce an 
overview of the relevant literature related to the use of journey data within the 
transport ecosystem. In addition to submitting regular reports of their findings, 
TravelSpirit planned and conducted a workshop for ODI staff in order to help us 
identify the modes of transportation worth focusing on and the types of themes 
worth exploring.  
 
We then conducted a landscape review which involved extensive research of the 
current use of journey data by organisations involved in the transport ecosystem. 
We identified a list of startups and large firms using journey data to improve 
services for customers, which we analysed and categorised according to the way 
that journey data was deployed within each organisation. A number of businesses 
were then selected for targeted, in-depth interviews. 
 
We conducted 11 interviews with participants from a range of backgrounds, 
striving for a balance between people from startups, SMEs, public sector 
organisations, research institutions and academia. Our interviewees were mainly 
from companies based in the UK (7), though we also interviewed one person each 
from Ireland, Singapore, Israel and Finland.
