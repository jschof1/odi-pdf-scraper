Foreword 
 
The Health & Safety Executive has a mission to lower the human cost of injury and ill health on 
construction sites. Enabling data sharing in a secure and resilient way to help businesses make better 
decisions is an important part of UK Government Policy. Industry is undergoing a technical 
revolution as information systems become more capable and far reaching. It is important therefore 
that HSE supports research to bring these factors together.  This Report explores the potential that 
sharing design risk data can have in reducing the levels of risk and uncertainty encountered on the 
construction site. The Sharing Data Saving Lives project has explored some key practical issues 
around how data can be shared, and what are the blockers and enablers, incentives and 
disincentives that prevent this happening. The potential size of the financial gains are explored, and 
a logic model presented to show how these gains can be realised. 
HSE values the opportunity to work with specialist research partners such as Atkins, the Open Data 
Institute and Metis Digital. This report opens up the issues around data sharing in the construction 
industry, and will provide a great basis for future initiatives in this area.

1. Key Messages 
 
1. Enterprises understand there are potential benefits in principle to share health & safety data 
but are unwilling or slow to do so in practice because of security, privacy and commercial 
concerns. Some examples already exist in the industry where information is shared in limited 
circumstances, but these are typically small scale and not designed to exploit 
standardisation and aggregation using digital technology. 
 
2. There are economic benefits which can accrue through sharing design risk data and 
improving design risk management as a result. The last major improvements to Health & 
Safety were seen between 2004/5 and 2009/10, if data sharing can replicate these 
improvements, this is equivalent to up to a 30% saving (of £198 million p.a.) in injury costs in 
construction. 
 
3. Design risk data is not typically produced by the industry in a format which is easy to share, 
even if organisations could overcome the barriers of security, privacy or commercial 
concerns. This project has demonstrated a way of sharing a limited amount of generic free 
text and coded data on health & safety risk, which is less subject to concerns about 
commercial or personal interest.  
 
4. Design risk data sharing has been demonstrated in this project to have benefits which can be 
realised in the short term through standardisation of terms and concepts core to design risk 
management in Construction. Public Sector Clients which operate across a number of 
regions with multiple programmes of projects are well placed to benefit. 
 
5. No one construction industry body by itself is likely to gain the trust of the industry to share 
data effectively. This is due in part to the fragmented way the industry represents itself 
through sector specific organisations. Although the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) 
uniquely has a common interest in all sectors, this research clearly shows that the majority 
of organisations do not see the HSE being the data steward in aggregating Health & Safety 
data across organisations due to their responsibility as a regulator.  
 
6. In order to build trust over the next few years the Discovering Safety Programme 
(www.discoveringsafety.com) is put forward as a vehicle to develop further design risk data 
sharing practice through its Construction Risk Library Project, which is independently funded 
and acts at arm’s length from the Regulator. In the longer term the development of a Data 
Institution or other suitable vehicle should be planned, in order to build on emerging 
practise where this can be shown to be effective.

7. The question of sustainability deserves particular emphasis and consideration because 
although the benefits of design risk data-sharing to the industry as a whole are likely to be 
substantial, there is a split between where the costs of collection, management and sharing 
are incurred and where its benefits are realised.

2. Executive Summary 
 
There is a human cost associated with accidents and ill health. Harm to workers or others affected 
by construction work activity can be prevented by reducing the levels of risk and uncertainty 
encountered on the construction site. This reduction can be achieved by sharing health & safety 
(H&S) data from the earliest design stage of a project and adopting more effective risk treatments at 
every stage of design and planning.  
In economic terms the cost of errors and rework in construction is estimated to be £5bn per year
1
 in 
the UK (5% of project costs, varying between 0-80%), with £1bn being attributed to incidents which 
result in injury or harm to persons affected by construction work. UK Government Policy identifies 
the need to reduce this figure, and also recognises value of sharing and making available, systematic 
and transparent data
2,3
. 
This project aimed to determine how significant an opportunity there is to benefit from sharing 
health & safety data in the construction industry and examined the practicalities of doing so. This 
project has been made possible by a grant of £198,831 from the £3.7 million Regulators' Pioneer 
Fund launched by The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS). 
The fund enables UK regulators and local authorities to help create a UK regulatory environment 
that unleashes innovation and makes the UK the best place to start and grow a business. 
The project team consisted of the Health and Safety Executive (HSE), Atkins, the Open Data Institute 
(ODI) and Metis Digital. The team had expertise in construction delivery, H&S in the context of 
construction, data strategies, sharing data and H&S risk data management in construction projects. 
Through an extensive programme of interviews with experts and examination of relevant studies, a 
logic model was created which described the problem of sharing risk data from the design stage of a 
project, the changes and outputs needed to affect a solution, and the resulting benefits to society, 
employers and individuals.  
Stakeholders agreed that sharing risk information and adopting best practice in risk treatment is 
likely to reduce the impact severity and frequency of incidents in construction. Productivity and 
corporate memory is also likely to be improved by the availability of a database of clearly defined 
risks and treatments. This may have particular value in relation to preventing rare catastrophic 
events. However, the balance of costs and benefits in relation to data sharing is unclear, because the 
evidence in the form of published data is lacking. However, the logic model does show a strong 
causal link between effective sharing of risk data and benefit in reducing costs. 
The main benefit of sharing risk data is reducing the number and impact of incidents. However, 
there are two further key benefits in the logic model which accrue from data sharing which are also 
evidenced in this report. These are benefits to an organisation which are described in this report as 
“moral glow”, arising from good H&S risk management and a robust institutional memory reducing 
training costs. This is associated with a skilled workforce, and assured levels of competence. The

second benefit is described as “reduced business friction” and is associated with construction 
businesses who operate with less margin of uncertainty and provide greater customer confidence in 
construction outcomes. Such businesses attract competitive insurance offers. 
The logic model could not develop a fully defined solution because of the short timescale for the 
project and a lack of data on relevant costs. A fully quantified assessment of costs and benefits was 
therefore not possible. However, significant research was completed to develop an expert reviewed 
idea of the nature and distribution of the benefits that might be achieved if design risk data sharing 
could be optimised. Some of the benefits relate to costs which have never been quantified, including 
loss of productivity and goodwill. The impact of data sharing was estimated in relation to historical 
savings that were made over the six-year period between 2004/5 and 2009/10.  This period showed 
a significant reduction in the costs associated with injury. 
If data sharing can be significant enough to replicate this improvement in reducing injury cost 
between 2004/05 and 2009/10, this may be equivalent to up to another 30% saving (of £198 million) 
in injury costs in construction. This would reduce the total economic costs in construction associated 
with workplace injuries and ill health down to approximately £1 billion (2018 prices). These figures 
underestimate the potential benefits, because they take no account of the costs of non-injury 
incidents, damage, and waste that are associated with uncertainties in design and planning 
information, and the need for rework. 
Alongside research into the benefits that may accrue through data sharing, the project also 
investigated the practicalities of data sharing. The project was limited to a six-month period, so it 
was difficult to do much more than gain a snapshot in time of how projects are working with design 
risk data, rather than being able to study the use of design risk data through the lifecycle of a 
project.  
Consultation with the industry took place through workshops, a structured survey, interviews and an 
online demonstrator. An initial workshop was held with 44 stakeholders attending, representing 
mainly large organisations, design consultancies, architects, infrastructure clients and contractors. 
There was a clear appetite from the attendees to engage with this project, both in terms of being 
part of the community going forward and sending information to their project teams. Stakeholders 
agreed that there are potential benefits to be had from sharing design risk and safety data within the 
construction industry. 
However, even in this first workshop, the positive desire for data sharing and progressive 
collaboration around design data was moderated by concerns around practical issues. These 
included security, privacy, ownership and governance in respect to data. The main ‘wants’ from 
attendees were around the desire for simplification, consistency and efficiency around recording and 
sharing design risk data. The main ‘needs’ were related to the necessity of good communication, 
both internally and externally between collaborators and competitors, as well as with the HSE. 
The project then followed up the first workshop with a survey in order to dig deeper into a more 
detailed range of issues around sharing data, and to try to obtain some structured feedback on key 
questions.  Responses to the survey revealed a high level of comfort and confidence held by 
participants in both their own, and their organisation’s, ability to manage design risk data effectively.  
Aggregation of design risk data was scored more highly as a valuable outcome than standardisation 
of data. On both topics, participants rated the value of doing so higher than the possibility of

executing it. Respondents recognised the importance of matching risk treatments to a risk and 
considered that fully automatic systems to do this would be less effective than semi-automatic 
systems. To explain this point, a fully automatic system would serve up an optimal risk treatment for 
the risk scenario, whereas a semi-automatic would serve up a number of treatment options for the 
user to choose between, or relevant guidance to formulate their own treatments. The survey asked 
how shared information should be overseen and where responsibility should sit for the overarching 
governance of this data. The survey recorded 32 responses from Stakeholders which listed an 
Independent third party highest at 45%, Industry self-regulates at 38%, and the Government 
Regulator at 17%.  
The survey was followed up by selected interviews with representative experts from the industry. As 
a result of these interviews, an octagon of issues was identified which collectively described how the 
culture and behaviours around data sharing at the design stage needs to change. Most of these 
issues can be both enablers for benefit, or blockers to prevent sharing, depending on their presence 
or influence. 
 
The project found that the key issues preventing sharing 
are not simple. They span across the domains of people 
management, skills and training, trust and human factors to 
the commercial and legal aspects around liability and 
regulation through to the professional practice areas of 
digital tools, data quality and standardisation. 
The project used a framework of design risk data founded 
on the PAS 1192-6:2018 “Specification for collaborative 
sharing and use of structured health and safety information 
using BIM (Building Information Modelling)”, to develop an 
online demonstrator.  This framework is also used by the 
Discovering Safety programme’s (DSP) Construction Risk 
Library project. The Discovering Safety programme is a global H&S improvement programme being 
run by the HSE and funded by the Lloyd’s Register Foundation. One of the key use-cases in this 
programme is the Construction Risk Library project which looks at using H&S risk data better through 
improving data-related processes.  
The DSP Construction Risk Library framework uses six data points to describe a risk scenario, and 
then seeks to match the risk scenario with an appropriate risk treatment. In the project 
demonstrator a simple form was used to determine how users input to this framework compares 
with current industry practice. The demonstrator showed effective identification, assessment, 
ownership and treatment of risk. The intention of putting the demonstrator online was to hold up a 
benchmark against which users could compare their own design risk recording method. The 
demonstrator provided opportunity for users to comment against each data point and entry box on 
the online tool.  
A key finding from the demonstrator was that the risk entries on the tool, which categorised the risk, 
and provided essential context to the risk, were the least easy for users to transfer entries into from 
existing records. Reasons for this include: the format of description of labelling of risks varies very 
widely; the language of hazard and risk is used interchangeably; and risks are often described in very

general terms. To further complicate the picture, the context, or direct circumstances in which risk 
may eventuate is rarely described. These factors made it very difficult for users to take advantage of 
any easy transfer of risk information into the demonstrator. 
Working with the project online demonstrator provided the opportunity to test and simulate ways of 
overcoming the 3 key challenges around industry organisation and relationships, standardisation, 
and liability. 
Through the project three types of relationships were highlighted as having particular relevance. 
1)   Between competitors – On the side of sharing data between competitors was a strong moral 
sense of this being the right thing to do, and of openness and transparency being a fine ideal. 
However, in practice this was swamped by commercial and legal concerns, often fuelled by an over 
cautious approach to legal and contractual obligations. 
2)   Regulator to Industry, Industry to Regulator – The project foresaw issues with a reluctance 
to share directly with the Regulator. A project partner, the Open Data Institute, was therefore 
selected to act as a trusted intermediary. However, in practice this made little difference.  
3)   Partnership working - The project did note successes working with those organisations that 
had close relationships with the project. Data sharing was facilitated by a more relational rather than 
transactional style of working. 
A key enabler which emerged as part of a solution to meet the barriers identified is the 
standardisation of data.  Part of a root issue is industry variation in practice, value and priority of 
design risk data management. Where standardised methodologies do exist, they are often 
associated with manual methods of recording risks. The use of 3D models, digital information 
management, and the use of Information standards such as ISO 19650, do offer great opportunities 
for progress in standardisation, and data sharing, but the practice of using them as core design risk 
management tools is not widespread or well developed. One possible incentive proposed was a 
standard audit format, approved by the Regulator, to benchmark industry practice against. A 
standard audit procedure could be developed based on pre-construction audits already being 
carried out by leading proponents in the industry, or developed from first principles. 
To reduce concerns around liability for sharing data, the two strategies cited were the 
encouragement of a standardised data model, perhaps based on the Discovering Safety Construction 
Risk Library model. The second strategy involved using only generalised and anonymised coded data, 
or generic text.  The use of technology to automate anonymisation and generalisation is a potential 
option, but the application of such tools is at a very early stage in the industry.  The issue of security 
of data and combatting cyber threats is also addressed to a large extent by sharing only a select 
amount of generalised and anonymised data.

3. Introduction 
 
The premise of this project is to encourage a better approach to reducing health and safety (H&S) 
risks by sharing data. Data are facts or details from which information is derived. Individual pieces of 
data are rarely useful alone. To be valuable each must be put into the correct context and shared 
with those that need it. Not doing this can come with a cost. The economic impact to the UK from 
construction errors and rework is estimated to be £5bn (5% of project costs)
4
. Incidents account for 
£1bn
5
. These costs are met by individuals, their families, employers and society. They could be 
reduced by accurate, early identification and treatment of health and safety risks at their source – 
i.e. when decisions are being made at the planning and design stage of projects 
6,7,8
. These decisions 
can also be subject to optimism bias
9
 resulting in a failure to prepare for, and mitigate against, 
infrequent but catastrophic health and safety events
10
. 
 
The importance of sharing construction data to reduce such risks is already recognised.  There is a 
consensus that the wide adoption of construction health and safety risk data sharing will improve 
self-regulation and reduce the significant financial (and human) impact of incidents. One programme 
looking to tackle H&S improvements is the Discovering Safety Programme (DSP), a global H&S 
improvement programme being run by the HSE and funded by the Lloyd’s Register Foundation. One 
of the key use-cases in this programme is the Construction Risk Library project which looks at using 
H&S risk data better through improving data-related processes. 
 
The importance of data sharing can be seen in the Discovering Safety programme’s SafetiBase Risk 
Library
11
, the Building Safety Bill
12,13
 and the Golden Thread report from the Buildings Advisory 
Committee. More generally, HMT Green Book notes the value of systematic data collected and made 
transparently available, as does the National Data Strategy.  
 
However, those who are required to invest and participate in data sharing may not be the ones who 
directly realise the benefits. This means the effect of data sharing on different stakeholders needs to 
be understood. This project, therefore, aimed to determine the opportunity and practicalities of 
sharing health and safety data. This project has been made possible by a grant of £198,831 from the

£3.7 million Regulators' Pioneer Fund launched by The Department for Business, Energy and 
Industrial Strategy (BEIS). The fund enables UK regulators and local authorities to help create a UK 
regulatory environment that unleashes innovation and makes the UK the best place to start and 
grow a business. 
The project was split into two core packages:  
1. Understanding the benefits – Here, the intention was to determine a model which would 
connect the action of sharing data to economic value, this would be justified by publicly 
available datasets and interviews. The deliverables included a logic model, a range for 
potential benefits and insights for future improvements on the detail. 
2. A sharing data demonstrator – Whilst determining the benefits, the project aimed to 
receive data from participants to gain industry insights and lessons learnt on data sharing for 
H&S. The deliverables for this were findings on how to share data. 
Both packages come together to discuss the value of sharing data, what is currently happening in the 
sector, and how to move closer towards achieving the sharing of H&S risk data nationally, improving 
self-regulation and reducing the severity and frequency of injuries.

4. Benefits of sharing data 
 
This aspect of the project focussed on developing and testing a working hypothesis for the benefits 
of sharing health and safety risk data. 
 
4.1. Methodology 
There have already been attempts to create sustainable business cases for sharing data across 
organisations and sectors. Examples include the National Underground Asset Register (NUAR) and 
National Digital Twin programme. An initial project hypothesis regarding the benefits of sharing of 
H&S risk data was developed using learning from these and expert input from the Discovering Safety 
Programme. Three broad benefits identified from the hypotheses to test were: 
 Fewer and less costly incidents and accidents in construction. 
 A positive “moral glow” associated with best practice H&S risk management giving rise to 
increased workforce productivity and client (societal) confidence in construction 
outcomes
14
. 
 Decreased “business friction” costs associated with lack of precision in risk and mitigation, 
paid in the form of higher insurance premiums and contingency costs. 
Interviews were conducted with 25 stakeholders from industry, academia and the public sector 
between Dec 2021 and March 2022. Interviewees were chosen based on their expertise, covering a 
wide range of areas. To generate a wider pool of interviewees, initial interviewees were asked if they 
had experts in their networks who we would benefit from interviewing. 
The interview format included a project introduction with a focus on the initial hypotheses. 
Interviewees were asked of their opinion on: 
 The validity of the initial hypothesis (above). 
 Existing and planned work on the benefits and beneficiaries of sharing data in general, and 
design risk and build environment data, in particular. 
 Insight and evidence of the impact on employers, society and individuals from sharing 
(design risk) data. 
Economic benefits are easier to quantify when there is a clear understanding of what intervention is 
being proposed. Therefore, a lack of interventions in sharing H&S risk data limits the project’s ability 
to forecast economic benefits with confidence.  Furthermore, given the scale of uptake and change, 
this is likely to be incremental rather than transformative. An estimate of the economic benefits 
from safer design based on data sharing was undertaken through analysis of existing literature 
including Health and Safety Executive (HSE) books, reports and other publications in the public 
domain.

4.2. Logic Model 
When trying to quantify the economic benefits, logic models are needed to align the problem being 
faced to a solution, this in turn creates outputs and impacts.  
Through engaging leaders with experience in the H&S risk data sharing space, Figure 2 was produced 
as the logic model for this study. This shows how the problem of economic costs from workplace 
related accidents could be addressed by curated accessible data on H&S risks. This model 
incorporates and develops further the framework in the HSE book by Gordon and Risley

4.2.1. Qualitative assessment of impact 
 
Reduced incident cost 
Stakeholders interviewed agreed that sharing risk information and best practice mitigation is likely 
to reduce the impact, frequency and severity of incidents in construction, and the costs incurred 
associated with them. At a project level, accessible best practice information can improve 
productivity at the design stage and outcomes during construction.  Furthermore, a national dataset 
detailing risks and treatments will create an evidence base to increase the speed of industry 
learning, including that relating to infrequent and catastrophic events. This evidence base can be 
used to document the potentially significant costs and impacts of H&S incidents which are not 
regularly quantified or mitigated. Stakeholders agree that the balance of costs and benefits to share 
data and subsequently reduce risks are either unclear or not considered sufficiently attractive. This is 
primarily because this activity has not been investigated to date, as well as H&S being seen as a 
means to meet regulatory demands than for something to innovate or improve on. 
Stakeholders also agree that some costs associated with H&S incidents are partially unaccounted for 
in the logic model, including employer’s: internal investigation; support of external investigation; the 
risk of business failure; and the human cost to individuals of coping with a colleague’s misfortune. 
 
Positive moral glow 
There is broad agreement amongst stakeholders interviewed on the positive impact (“moral glow”) 
from good H&S risk management for employers. Stakeholders referred to a robust institutional 
memory reducing training costs and incident frequency. 
Further, a societal moral glow was suggested with the creation of differentiated national 
competence in H&S design risk management and a skilled workforce capable of offering competitive 
services internationally. 
Less Business friction in the mitigation of risks and uncertainty 
The costs of H&S incidents and waste are linked, with 37% accidents occurring during rework
16
. Such 
costs are typically met by “contingency” budgets which act as a margin of uncertainty in delivery, 
undermining societal confidence in construction outcomes. 
There is limited evidence of increased “business friction” for enterprises which have poor H&S 
design risk practices. Stakeholders agree that “poor performers” may have reduced access to 
opportunities
17
 and find it harder to obtain competitive insurance offers. However, interviewees 
supporting the Building Safety Bill have found that the insurance market does not currently support 
an exact correlation between risk identification and insurance costs. Insurers instead focus on what 
processes have been defined and adhered to and claim history. However, due to the pandemic 
issues and market defining losses, insurers are reducing appetite and capacity. In addition, where 
they are underwriting, they are requesting more project-based information

improved and consistent process of sharing data across projects and organisations, insurance 
companies gain more assurance and certainty, delivering value back to the industry.  
 
4.2.2. Quantitative assessment of Impact 
In the absence of a fully defined data sharing solution, it is not possible to speculate on the total 
impact of sharing data on the various stakeholders.  An economic analysis on the result of reduced 
frequency and severity of accidents is included below. 
Some insight into the impact of positive moral glow and negative business friction is available using 
the techniques and analysis from Reputation Dividend which endeavours to calculate the proportion 
of market capitalisation attributable to listed company reputation. Reputation Dividend suggest that 
good H&S risk management has an impact on the market and stakeholder perception of quality of 
management, quality of products and in Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) performance.  
This difficult to measure effect contributes to market capitalisation with the reputation contribution 
turning from a contributor to a detractor as businesses fail, shown in the Carillion chart (below):

4.2.3. Proposed solution 
It should be noted that the groups who will need to invest to create a data sharing solution 
(designers and data stewards) are not those who will necessarily benefit from the solution 
(contractors, clients and society). 
There are many significant barriers to the implementation of any data sharing solution, outlined 
below:

Securing of benefit The investors in data and data 
stewardship do not realise the benefits 
The demonstrator project 
supports cost identification 
and the benefits mapping work 
has helped to identify potential 
beneficiaries 
 
In addition, any solution should complement the implementation of the National Data Strategy and 
Building Safety Bill. 
 
4.3. Economic Benefit 
After defining the impact from interventions through better risk data and management, the scoping 
of potential economic benefit can be determined. To tackle this, the Project used supporting data 
from the HSE’s publicly available records outlined later in 4.3.2. It should be noted that this focuses 
on the economics of incidents occurring and not how the better planning of projects through better 
H&S practices delivers programmatic value. 
Many of the benefits discussed above specifically fall outside the costs measured not only by HSE 
but also those measured by enterprises, individuals and society.  Specifically, HSE notes
20
 the 
unquantifiable costs associated with reduced productivity, as a result of injuries or absenteeism and 
loss of goodwill and reputation of the firm with its workforce, customers and the local community.  
In addition, the formal costs of investigation in available data are only attributed to HSE, any cost to 
the injured person’s employer is not recorded.  Interviewees formed the view that this was at least 
equivalent to HSE costs.

4.3.1. Supporting data 
HSE first produced aggregate estimates of the costs to Great Britain of workplace accidents and 
work-related ill health for 1990/91 in a seminal report by Davies and Teasdale
21
, separately 
identifying costs to the individual, to the employer and to society. These estimates were updated for 
1995/96 by Gordon and Risley
22
, with an interim update for 2001/02
23
. Since the interim update, 
significant changes in methodology have been adopted in the HSE Costs to Britain Model and 
therefore estimates presented thereafter are not directly comparable to what was previously 
prepared on a like-for-like basis. 
Headline changes in the methodology have been outlined in Appendix 5 of a research report
24
 
published in 2011 with regards to the costs to Britain of workplace injuries and work-related ill 
health in 2006/07. We have reviewed all aforementioned books and reports and found that the 
original book by Gordon and Risley with regards to the cost to Britain in 1995/96 provides a sound 
(although known to be incomplete) foundation for establishing a benefit framework due to its 
comprehensive approach and thorough explanations. This helps categorise different types of 
impacts and economic costs associated with workplace injuries and work-related ill health. 
Information in this book was therefore used to inform the development of the logic map and 
economic model following the central government’s guidance on evaluation in the Magenta Book
25
. 
Relevant data published by HSE from 2004/5 to 2018/19 has also been examined, including the 
aforementioned research report on the 2006/07 costs and a separate report
26
 for the 2018/19 costs. 
These reports and dataset give a high-level and more up-to-date articulation of the economic costs 
of workplace injuries and work-related ill health, taking into account the evolution in the 
methodology adopted by the HSE since early 2000’s. 
Due to 2018 being the last undisturbed financial year since the pandemic, global conflicts and their 
resulting economic impacts, use of this data is more representative in lieu of any up-to-date 
information that may be available.

4.3.2. Determining the total savings available 
An illustration of the range of economic costs relevant following the approach documented in the 
HSE book is presented in the figure below, with indication of relevant cost bearers. This illustration 
originated from the aforementioned HSE 2001/02 interim update. 
 
It should be recognised that in 
some cases, a cost to one cost 
bearer (individuals, employers 
or society, as seen in Figure 4) 
is an equal and opposite 
benefit for another bearer. For 
example, sick pay represents a 
cost to the employer but is an 
equal and opposite benefit to 
the individual who receives it, 
so at the societal level the sick 
pay cancels out to zero. These 
are ‘transfer payments’: a cost 
from employers transferred as 
a benefit to individuals. 
Table 2 summarises estimates 
of total costs of workplace 
injuries and work-related ill 
health presented in historic 
reports examined. Figures 
summarised in the table are 
not directly comparable as 
they were based on different 
methodologies and limited by 
the level of details presented 
in the relevant reports.  
Although these figures are not 
a direct replacement to each 
other in different years, this 
table still provides an overview 
of historic estimates.  It may be 
observed that overall, the costs 
associated with workplace 
injuries and work-related ill health as a percentage of the GDP marginally reduce over time, and the 
costs associated with the construction sector are a small fraction of the overall cost, generally in the 
order of £1 to 2billion.

4.3.3. Cost trends and distribution  
More comparable estimates of the same costs are available between 2004/5 and 2018/19 based on 
information from the HSE’s Costs to Britain model. These are presented in the chart below with all 
monetary values in 2018 prices (chart originally presented in HSE’s 2018/19 statistics). 
 
Figure 5 - Cost Trends 
 
It can be observed that the total cost (across all sectors) fell by approximately 17% from £19.3 billion 
to £16.1 billion between 2004/5 and 2009/10. This is mainly driven by a reduction in the number of 
workplace injuries. The overall reduction in the injury costs was found by HSE to be statistically 
significant (from £7.90 billion to £5.57 billion in 2018 prices between 2004/5 and 2009/10). The fall 

22 
Contains sensitive information 
 
visible in ill health costs over the same period was not found to be statistically significant. Since 
2009/10, both injury and ill health costs have remained broadly level. 
There are insufficient details in the time series data by sector to ascertain whether the trends 
observed across all sectors apply to construction alone. The latest estimate on construction related 
economic costs associated with workplace injuries and work-related ill health is from the 2018/19 
estimate, which is based on the average annual number of workplace injuries and work-related 
illnesses for the three years from 2017/18 to 2019/20, as presented in the table below.

Figure 6 illustrates how the total cost of £1.22 billion in the construction industry may distribute 
across different cost bearers based on the distributional pattern observed across all sectors. The 
total cost of £1.22 billion is represented by the cost to society (the rightmost column). This figure 
represents the latest estimate on the relative distribution against which potential economic benefits 
can be claimed for data sharing for safer design in construction.

4.3.4. Headline findings 
The impact of the counterfactual (not sharing data in a consistent and transparent approach across 
the sector) would be missed opportunities in reducing the economic costs associated with workplace 
injuries and work-related ill health in construction. Such savings could be claimed as the economic 
benefits from sharing data (in a consistent and transparent approach across the sector) for safer 
design in construction.  No attempt has been made to estimate the societal benefits of either 
greater certainty in output from reduced accidents and incidents in construction projects or from 
the upskilling of the design and construction communities in health and safety risks and mitigation. 
The lack of details on specific proposed data sharing solutions (given its conceptual status) limits our 
ability to explore quantitatively its economic benefits with confidence and specificity. A glimpse of 
the potential impact may be speculated with reference to what has been achieved historically across 
all sectors. 
The most significant improvement (i.e. savings in costs associated with workplace injuries and work-
related ill health) occurred during a six-year period from 2004/5 to 2009/10, where injury costs 
across all employment sectors were reduced from £7.90 billion to £5.57 billion (2018 prices), 
approximately a 30% reduction. Over the period, the changes in ill-health related costs have not 
been found to be statistically significant. Both cost elements (injury and ill-health related) remained 
level from 2009/10 to 2018/19   
It was inferred from the observations that reduction in ill-health related cost is a lot more difficult to 
achieve as this cost has not changed materially since 2004/5. The 30% reduction in injury costs to 
2009/10 may be attributed to improvement in the safety practice, regulation, training and 
awareness.  We have taken the last period over which a change was statistically significant as the 
potential for improvement across the construction sector.   
 
If data sharing can be significant enough to replicate this improvement in reducing injury cost 
between 2004/05 and 2009/10, this may be equivalent to up to another 30% saving (of £198 million) 
in injury costs in construction. This would reduce the total economic costs in construction associated 
with workplace injuries and ill health down to approximately £1 billion (2018 prices). The amount of 
monetary benefits equivalent to different assumed percentages of savings and the resultant total 
economic costs in the construction sector are illustrated in the table below. Please note these are 
not economic forecasts, but just illustrations of what benefits may be achieved. The figures also 
exclude the potential benefits described in 4.3 above.

The above assumed savings do not cover the full extent of impacts and instead focus on the two 
boxes as highlighted in Figure 7. It should therefore be noted that more annual savings could be 
realised from the £1.22bn as well as from efficiencies on projects/programmes from better planning 
as a by-product of better risk management. In order to identify these impacts and a trend, further 
detailed work would need to be carried out.

5. Sharing data practicalities 
 
This aspect of the project focussed on determining practical steps to sharing H&S risk data. 
 
5.1. Approach 
The potential benefits of sharing and managing risk data can only be realised through effective 
application. This is not straightforward. This element of the project sought to determine practical 
ways to achieve this that would be sustainable in the long-term. 
 
Although looking at the long-term, the approaches used also had to consider the project’s fixed 
funding timeframe (6 months) and the limitations associated with this. These include: 
 Construction projects (and the assets they produce) typically exist over a much longer 
timeframe. Research into the practical impact of sharing data would need to be done over an 
extended period. 
 Participants requested the deletion of shared data at the project’s conclusion. This limits the 
lifespan of its value.  
 The different governance arrangements required between short and long-term projects. 
 The challenge of engaging representative of wider industry interests (commercial, insurance, 
finance etc.) and getting them to participate.  
 
To address these issues the project focussed on the following two approaches:  
 
1. Establishing the practical issues associated with data sharing in the construction industry 
through industry engagement, and; 
2. Developing a demonstrator to test data capture and sharing. 
 
5.2. Methodology 
The initial methodology focused on using a series of workshops with industry representatives. The 
objectives were to obtain their views, ask them to share data and then work with them on the 
insights gained.  
 
An initial online workshop was run on the 22nd of November 2021.  It was focussed on how 
organisations currently share data and what the primary barriers are within the sector. There were 
44 attendees from across the construction industry. They included engineers, architects, regulators, 
asset owners, software vendors and data analysts. After this workshop it was clear that obtaining 
data from these attendees was likely to be slower and more difficult than anticipated. An in-depth 
survey and interview process was therefore included to gain more structured feedback.  
 
The survey focused on gaining key insights relevant to sharing and collecting design risk information. 
It ran between 17 December 2021 until 14 January 2022. Seventy-two organisations and individuals 
were invited to participate. They were identified from the initial workshop attendees and 
stakeholders. Thirty-two responses were received (44% return rate). Most were part of a large 
organisation - 70% having over 1000 employees and 93% having over 100.

Insights from the survey informed the development of the demonstrator. This demonstrator focused 
on the core issue of standardisation. This was selected because: 
 The other key areas were covered in the survey and planned interviews.  
 It was not feasible to address them using the demonstrator within the project’s timeframe. 
 
The demonstrator involved creating an online tool that allowed participants to submit their risk data 
in a standardised format. The format used a simplified set of Risk Classification Terms. It was an 
adapted version of Annex A from Industry Standard PAS 1192-6:2018 (Specification for collaborative 
sharing and use of structured health & safety information using BIM). As part of an industry initiative 
to improve the capture of H&S risk data, SafetiBase was developed. SafetiBase is an offering from 3D 
Repo (a software group) that allows the user to capture their H&S information in line with PAS 1192-
6. 3D Repo worked together with Atkins and other industry partners to further develop the schema 
that they use.  
The demonstrator’s version considers updates from the SafetiBase team (3D Repo and Atkins) and 
the Discovering Safety programme, commonly referred to as the Discovering Safety Risk Library.

Responsibility for building, hosting and operating the demonstrator was placed with the Open Data 
Institute as one of the project partners. This was a project strategy to defuse any concern that data 
shared might be transferred across to the regulator. It was supported by stakeholders and was 
central to project delivery.  
The final workshop was held on Monday 7th February 2022. It began with a summary of findings up 
to that point, including a recap of the first workshop and the insights gained from the survey. This 
was to ensure participants felt part of an iterative cycle of information gathering and dissemination, 
to understand that this project is focussed on sharing data for the benefit of the community itself. 
 
A reasoned description of the demonstrator then preceded some dedicated exercise time. 
Attendees were invited to explore using the tool and to upload example risk entries they had been 
requested to prepare in advance. This process seeded a final group discussion which highlighted 
several points concerning risk data handling in general. 
 
Following the workshop, information about the demonstrator was emailed to those who could not 
attend. It remained live and open for a period of three weeks to allow as many users as possible to 
engage with it. Additional material was also provided to project organisers for use in the form of 
several raw anonymised risk registers.  
 
Interviews were also held with five industry experts between 01– 10 March 2022. These interviews 
focussed on issues relating to design risk and treatment data sharing, the survey outcomes and the 
live demonstrator. The findings are combined with the survey results below to protect the 
anonymity of interviewees.  
 
5.3. Findings 
 
5.3.1. The Initial Workshop 
 
Attendees demonstrated a clear appetite to engage with the project at this workshop. This was both 
in terms of being part of the community going forward and sending information to the project team; 
although this did not translate into practice as the project progressed. They also agreed with the 
principle that sharing design risk and safety data within the construction industry has potential 
benefits.

Discussions about the challenges and solutions followed. Attendees shared their views about 
organisational concerns when it comes to data sharing in practice as well as their experiences of how 
to overcome these challenges. Key themes were: 
 
 Data must be structured and standardised to facilitate its sharing and aggregation. 
 Organisational culture can be a barrier to sharing. This will take time to influence. 
 Organisations differ in terms of size and budget. Smaller players face different challenges to 
bigger firms. They may perceive the benefits differently as well. 
 
Attendees also had an opportunity to communicate what they would want and need in order to feel 
confident in sharing data with the project. The main ‘wants’ were for simple, consistent and efficient 
design risk data recording. The main ‘needs’ centred around good communication - both internally 
and externally, between collaborators and competitors, as well as with the HSE. The main concerns 
expressed regarded security, privacy, ownership, and governance. There was strong agreement 
about the need for confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements before data sharing could 
proceed. 
 
5.3.2. The Survey 
 
Further data from the survey is presented in Appendix A. The key findings from the survey were: 
 
 Producer or Benefactor? Most respondents (78%) considered their organisation to be both a 
producer and a user/benefactor of design risk data. The next largest category (just 9%) 
accounted for those who just produced such information. This shows that a majority of 
participants have something to contribute and benefit from. The scale of this benefit is currently 
unknown. 
 
Figure 8 - Survey responses on the nature of respondents’ organisations 
 
 
 Effectiveness of design risk data use: Most considered their organisation to be relatively 
effective when working with design risk data. All respondents, bar one, rated their organisation 
at least three on a five point scale. The modal response was a rating of four. Respondents gave 
broadly similar ratings when asked to consider their own personal effectiveness with design risk

data was quite similar. These responses indicate a broad level of comfort with current design risk 
data practices.

Figure 10 - Survey responses on personal effectiveness with design risk data 
 
 
 Issues Impacting on Data Sharing: The survey identified several difficulties that may impact on a 
company sharing design risk data. These include: 
 
‒ Over-Complication: Design risk data needs to be as simple as possible and free from 
unnecessary complexities. 
‒ Arbitrary Scoring: Limiting the use of risk scores. These are often subjective and / or 
produced without suitable rigour meaning they have limited value. 
‒ Long descriptions: Risk descriptions should be simple and to the point. Many go into too 
much detail that does not add value. 
‒ Assumptions: Detailing assumptions linked to each risk also takes up space and does not add 
value. 
‒ Duplication: Including the same risk under slightly different scenarios. 

35 
Contains sensitive information 
 
‒ Ownership: Clarity on who owns the risk and is accountable for its mitigation is seen as a 
particularly important. 
 
Survey participants identified that data needs to be simplified and standardised to align it with all 
users and other industries. This includes the need for guidance. Respondents indicated that a 
broader set of tools (which includes an audit format with agreed data fields and formats) would be a 
significant incentive for their organisation to commit to changing how they currently capture and 
share such data. 
 
The survey allowed respondents to list the risk and treatment options that they most supported. 
This was to identify priorities. For risk the favoured options related to ‘Likelihood’ and ‘Severity/ 
Consequence’. For treatments this was ‘Type’, ‘Mitigation’ and ‘Status’. Clarity of ownership was 
another distinct priority. This is to drive tasks to meaningful action. There was strong support for 
aggregating design risk data and less support for standardisation (see Figure 11). There was also 
strong support for semi-automated risk-treatment matching with low support for this being fully 
automated. This indicates respondents recognise the importance of having oversight of the risk 
treatments and that the process of risk-treatment matching has a medium to high level of difficulty. 
 
Figure 11 - Survey responses on the value and possibility of design risk data aggregation and standardisation 
 
 
The survey asked respondents about governance arrangements for data sharing and where 
responsibility should sit. An independent third party was the most popular options (45%) followed 
by industry self-regulation (38%). The least popular option was a government regulator (17%). The 
survey, workshop and interviews all identified a clear hesitation about working with a regulator in 
this area.

5.3.3. Demonstrator 
The creation of a live demonstrator was a key focus of the project. The ambition was to create a 
benchmark tool which would enable industry to input data that could be assessed against a standard 
data capturing format as seen in Table 5. It also provided the opportunity to test ways of overcoming 
three key challenges - industry organisation and relationships, standardisation, and liability.

A 1-to-5 scale was used to rank the difficulty users had when mapping their source document to the 
demonstrator fields - 1 being most easy and 5 being most difficult. The average value for all twelve 
fields was 2.45 with the lowest score being 1 and the highest 4.2. 
 
The average mapping difficulty for each individual demonstrator field is shown in Figure 133. They 
can be judged against this baseline score. Some fields are known to be common throughout the 
community, such as ‘Likelihood’ and ‘Severity / Consequence’. It is therefore unsurprising that they 
had average mapping difficulty scores of 1.88 and 1.86, respectively. It should be noted that despite 
their use appearing to be common, several critical comments were directed towards risk matrices 
formed by using these two fields. The lowest score of 1.43 was for ‘Owner identified’. Again, this is 
unsurprising as it is essentially a binary field. 
 
Conversely the highest score of 3.13 was for the ‘Element type’ field. Many submissions took 
advantage of the ability to select more than one option for multiple choice fields. It shows that 
submitted entries often didn't fall neatly into one particular option. 
 
These findings are interesting. They clearly highlight a preference in the industry around the basic 
health and safety data requirements. However, these fields alone do not allow for greater insight. 
This requires additional fields which allows for more filters, more insights and better connections 
between clusters – creating links that before may not have been known.

Feedback revealed some additional things that participants would have liked to have seen: 
‒ The content of the schema on vehicles, machinery, and also biological issues did not cover 
the extent and granularity that some users wished.  
‒ Expansion of other categories was also desired to cover a range of disparate activities from 
traffic signalling to pumping, 
‒ Further situation categories were requested such as temporary works and water-based 
environments.  
‒ Some users highlighted a desire for more situational issues where the main factors are not 
so related to physical elements.  
‒ Some mention was made of a need to better accommodate managerial, financial, and 
environmental factors too, showing a misunderstanding of H&S risk registers. 
 
Further insights were gained by examining the small cache of redacted risk registers provided to the 
project. This allowed entries to be observed from an overarching perspective when compared to 
those uploaded by online users. The latter may have suffered from selection bias or entry error.  
 
It was not uncommon to have a number of missing fields for a given entry in many of these risk 
registers. This indicates that these fields are either somewhat superfluous, difficult to complete or 
lacking quality control. A tight end-to-end process should have most fields entered if the risk register 
is designed well enough for a specific range of needs.  
 
For completed information it was clear that a number of risk registers favoured having certain 
information over multiple fields where the demonstrator had one. For example, some risk registers 
had separate free text fields for ‘Event’, Cause’ and ‘Impact’ or had similar fields to that effect. In the 
demonstrator approach these were all bundled together in the single free text field for ‘Risk 
Description’.   
 
Conversely, they also combined certain information within one where the demonstrator has 
multiple fields. Certain risk registers had risk description fields that explicitly prompted the user to 
insert details for aspects like location. This has its own independent field in the demonstrator. Only 
one of the available risk registers had this. 
 
The examination of complete risk registers showed ‘Likelihood’ and ‘Severity / Consequence’ 
matched best in addition to free text fields of risk and treatment descriptions. This mirrors the 
findings from the data uploaded to the online tool. These fields seem to provide the accepted base 
case for what a risk register currently looks like.  
 
Further in line with the findings from uploaded data, there was a noticeable disparity between some 
of the prominent multiple choice demonstrator fields and the information in the available risk 
registers. The ‘Designer Focus’ and ‘Construction Scope’ demonstrator fields had some degree of 
matching with a few risk registers, but more so when the essence of the information was considered 
rather than the exact options. The ‘Risk Category’, ‘Risk Factor’ and ‘Element Type’ demonstrator 
fields were virtually unmatched across any of the available risk registers. 
 
From the other perspective, it was clear that the community favoured certain aspects of information 
that the demonstrator approach does not cater for at all – intentionally omitted, although it is 

40 
Contains sensitive information 
 
available in the 3D Repo platform. A common theme throughout the available risk registers was a 
sense of time progression, in terms of pre-treatment and post-treatment status, including residual 
risk information. Other things that were seen include not only measures of a singular likelihood, but 
rather estimations of worst-case, best-case and most-likely case scenarios.  
 
All of these observations raise valid questions about both the type of content and the level of detail 
needed in a standardised risk data schema, to provide a basis which is both rich and nuanced 
enough to satisfy needs, without resorting to unrestrained free text in all fields. It is preferable to 
keep as much as possible on such a quantised basis, given an appropriate level of flexibility, as this 
has a number of benefits over free text. A user can then become well acquainted with the relevant 
options for their specific area, and so more readily complete such a risk assessment than continually 
striving for appropriate free text descriptions. 
 
This in turn has the added benefit of being better understood by others, by ensuring that all users 
subscribe to a common language. It is the chain of process and communication that forms the real 
core of needs being addressed here, beyond simply recording the issues. Free text has its place as an 
overview, but is highly dependent on the style of the author and can be subject to misinterpretation. 
 
Furthermore, a controlled set of discrete options may also lend itself better to automated analysis 
such as those available in 3D Repo. If applied to enough data from a large-scale data sharing scheme 
over a period of time, it may be able to discern patterns that could lead to practical guidance on how 
to steer practices for the better, with statistically apparent results. Such goals are paramount, being 
the culmination of data, communication and action. 
 
The project survey of existing risk registers indicates that the Discovering Safety data model (Table 5) 
overlaps significantly but not perfectly with the information commonly captured in such registers. 
Some revision and modification of the data model may help to increase its utility and ease adoption.

5.3.4. Interviews  
The one-to-one interviews yielded valuable feedback on the detail presented in the demonstrator, 
survey findings and the overall project outcomes. In an effort to summarise the outcomes of both 
the lessons learnt in the survey and interviews, eight core areas have been outlined which enable 
the effective sharing of health and safety data, these are shown in Figure 14 
Each area was explored during the interview phase. The 
information gathered was combined with survey findings to 
protect the anonymity of interviewees and are captured in 
Table 8.

6. Discussion 
 
The project found clear agreement amongst workshops attendees and interviewees that data 
sharing is a good idea. Sharing of data is happening in specific, limited initiatives across the industry 
such as Collaborative Reporting for Safer Structures (CROSS UK) and the Designer’s Initiative on 
Health and Safety (DIOHAS). These initiatives are effective but focus on specific user groups.  
This project demonstrated that whilst data sharing is perceived to be a good idea, in practice 
delivery is difficult. To look at this in more detail, this section discusses these difficulties under three 
key headings, Benefits, Understanding and Governance. 
 
6.1. Benefits 
Benefits are what drive the purpose of any endeavour, without determining benefits, there are few 
mechanisms to incentivise groups. This project recognised, in both the survey and interviews, that 
there was a strong belief that there would be a benefit in sharing industry data, however, there were 
few organisations willing to act on this belief. The possible reasons for this are explored later in the 
discussion. The focus here is on how understanding the benefits can tackle this problem. The first 
point to explore is how benefits at the societal (macro) level can be delivered by surfacing the 
benefits at a project (micro) level. 
 
6.1.1. Micro to Macro 
A key problem is that the beneficiaries of data sharing are not always those who bear the costs. The 
project notes that a short-term study is unable to tie into construction design projects/programmes 
and demonstrate value throughout these longer timescale projects. For that reason, a good focus 
would be for micro-level benefits to be derived at the project, programme and organisational levels. 
This will link principles required to establish the data sharing endeavour at a macro-level and micro-
level. This creates an incentive for an organisation to act for their own benefit without having to 
focus too heavily on the wider economic value.  
For example, to tackle organisation incentivisation, standardisation could be the initial focus. 
Creating a standardised structure for an organisation to operate its design/construction H&S risks 
will invariably provide greater insight: allowing the targeting of specialist knowledge; providing a 
clear structure for insurance brokers and providing greater organisational assurance – reducing 
costs. In this example, if multiple organisations standardised in the same way for their own benefit, 
this would start to solve the national problem of how to provide a similar structure that everyone 
can follow. 
When considering how to tackle the organisational issues, it is important to make sure these tie to 
the national problems, so that the solution can be appropriately scaled.  
It should be noted that micro-incentives can be instilled through macro-levers, such as through 
policy development. Negative incentives are usually the initial focus for incentivising groups. 
However, whilst they are important, it is better to consider the positive, organisational incentives 
first before turning to the industry levers.  

47 
Contains sensitive information 
 
6.1.2. Connecting H&S to delivery efficiencies 
Through the benefits work, it was only possible at this stage to focus on datasets that existed and 
provided enough rigour to develop a conservative estimate of savings. However, the logic model 
shows value far beyond that which has been proposed. In order to recognise this, clear links need to 
be made between organisational/programmatic improvements similar to Paul O’Neill’s safety-first 
approach as Alcoa’s CEO
27
. More of this type of work can help link infrastructure performance 
improvements unlocking further savings beyond the projected reduced welfare spend on injuries. 
In addition, once a solution has been confirmed, the benefits and associated incentives can be 
determined, driving a more focused effort on the true economic value. 
 
6.2. Understanding 
Education is a cross-cutting theme for the findings which shows of a lack of awareness/knowledge of 
the value of H&S, design risk management, data and data sharing. This lack of knowledge makes it 
difficult to perceive value and take meaningful next steps. Trust in H&S risk data sharing, data 
standards and organisational relationships are areas where awareness is needed. 
 
6.2.1. Trust in H&S risk data sharing 
The initial workshop and survey into data-sharing within the industry highlighted a number of 
concerns acting as barriers to data-sharing, ranging from legal and compliance questions through to 
concerns about ownership and governance. These findings suggest that decision-makers need both 
education concerning the risks and benefits of H&S information-sharing, and support in assessing 
these before they feel equipped to make decisions with confidence in this area. 
A lack of clarity and resulting reluctance regarding data-sharing decisions is not unique to the 
construction sector. In response to this persistent cross-sectoral challenge, the ODI has begun to 
explore the feasibility and utility of a simple decision-tree online tool to address the fear, 
uncertainty, and doubt often encountered in the preliminary stages of data-sharing between 
organisations
28
. 
It should be emphasised that the purpose of this tool is to raise discussion, debate, and awareness of 
the issues potentially involved in information sharing, rather than to issue binary ‘yes’/’no’ 
judgements about doing so; as such it is not a ‘magic bullet’ for managers. With content customised 
to fit the needs of the construction industry, however, such a tool may provide a relatively low-cost 
and low-maintenance way for organisations to assess and, ideally, begin to embrace data-sharing as 
a practice, as well as to mitigate the risks attendant upon this. 
 
6.2.2. Data standards and tools 
The logic model identifies data standards as a single solution that enables both data analytics and 
the creation of curated accessible H&S risk data; onward outputs from this then include useful data

on risks and mitigations, curated consistent interoperable data, and usable data insights. 
Furthermore, the potential role of data standards in furnishing a solution to data sharing barriers is 
well-understood within the industry: 72% of respondents to the survey felt that ‘an industry-wide 
standardisation of design risk data would be valuable to [their] organisation’. Confidence in the 
feasibility of such a solution was more muted; nevertheless, 63% of respondents believed ‘an 
industry-wide standardisation of design risk data would be possible’, with 19% being uncertain. 
Addressing such restrictions and variability are, however, part and parcel of the normal process of 
standards development. PAS 1192-6 in 2018, the Discovering Safety programme and the 
development of ISO 19650-6 are tackling the standardisation challenge. The PAS, a publicly available 
specification in Britain, has developed the initial structure for detailing H&S risk data and DSP is 
developing this further. The international standard, ISO 19650-6, is currently in development. This 
international standard builds off PAS 1192-6 and DSP, consolidating experience into new 
requirements and pushing this standard to an international community. 
To add to this, companies like 3D Repo are implementing these standards as part of their wider 
software offering, embedding H&S risk data sharing principles at the core of their offer
29
. However, 
it seems the industry still needs to be made aware of these and the development of a guide would 
be beneficial in precipitating widespread implementation of best practice from clients through to 
appointed parties. 
We recommend that the ISO 19650-6 standard under development incorporates these learnings and 
promotes the adoption of this standard by organisations and, in particular, software vendors within 
the sector. Such adoption will allow data collection to be standardised at point of entry - and hence 
to be readily and meaningfully shared and reused as appropriate. Ongoing use in current H&S 
systems will furthermore ensure that the information thus gathered remains current and relevant, 
rather than being left as a historical exercise.  
 
6.2.3. Organisational relationships  
During the survey, participants expressed a clear preference to not share their data with HSE and 
placed a government regulator as being the last group they would want as a data steward. Whilst 
the industry perception is that the HSE’s remit is primarily to prosecute, it has a broader role “to 
prevent work-related death, injury and ill health”. The industry focus should be on improving health 
and safety performance in collaboration, including with the HSE. This will help to reduce accidents 
across the sector and improve economic outputs. This may not involve sharing data with HSE, but it 
will require co-operation and an improvement on the current approach. 
The industry’s current method of project delivery involves a lot of information and responsibility 
handover. This is true for H&S information also. As a result, the decision and actions made during a 
project, including the information that is captured about them, impact whether an incident occurs or 
not. Workshop participants may not be familiar with the new methods in which H&S risk data can be 
used effectively. Therefore, their perceived effectiveness can only be as good as far as their 
awareness extends. It should also be considered that there are negative connotations in admitting 
any negligence.

Currently, the industry is predominantly influenced by “guilt culture” dynamics – expecting 
punishment for negligence. Whilst a weak positive dynamic exists in the form of keeping up the 
public image, the industry needs to incorporate a more mature approach. This could move towards 
internalising questions such as “Would I like to be injured myself? Are my actions and decisions 
therefore appropriate?”. This can be embedded within the industry through education of ethics 
(responsibilities/impact) in H&S risk management and promoting organisations to work better 
together.  
This presents a more general challenge identified with changing the culture of the construction 
industry. It will be far more difficult than changing the culture within one organisation. There is a 
collective challenge across a whole set of stakeholders, clients, designers and contractors.   
 
6.3. Governance 
Discussions with stakeholders failed to clearly identify a recommendation of who should undertake 
any effort for sharing H&S risk data nationally in the long-term and how it should be funded, 
supported and governed. This section looks to address this, noting that a single entity may not be 
the answer. 
 
6.3.1. Supporting bodies 
Any entity that is created/re-purposed/appointed to undertake the development of this structure 
can take solace in the fact that a number of areas requiring attention are already being tackled and 
supported by different bodies across the industry. This entity can work together with the following 
groups against their respective areas – this group will likely change with time: 
 Security: Centre for Protected National Infrastructure. 
 Standards and Guidance: UK BIM Framework, British Standards Institute, BIM4H&S and 
International Organisation for Standardization (ISO). 
 Benefits and approach: National Underground Asset Register. 
 H&S risk data sharing & enabling tools: 3D Repo & Atkins (SafetiBase), Discovering Safety 
Programme. 
 Industry Knowledge: Construction Industry Advisory Committee (CONIAC) and Construction 
Leadership Council (CLC). 
 Industry engagement: Construction industry institutions (ICE, IET etc.). 
 H&S Sharing: Collaborative Reporting for Safer Structures (CROSS UK) and the Designer’s 
Initiative on Health and Safety (DIOHAS). 
 Data Sharing principles: Open Data Institute. 
 
6.3.2. Security 
One of the most common risk mitigations for data sharing is the removal or masking of sensitive 
information. The most common kind of information requiring such treatment is personal data, as 

50 
Contains sensitive information 
 
defined by legislative instruments such as the General Data Protection Regulation. However, other 
kinds of data – for example, security or commercially-sensitive data will often also require shielding 
in the construction sector. 
At a smaller scale, information-screening of this kind can normally be managed manually, with 
sensitive data being removed prior to sharing. At a larger scale, however, the use of automated 
techniques becomes necessary to ensure shielded data does not enter the common store. A wide 
range of these techniques are available, with the precise technology and approach adopted 
depending on need and feasibility. 
Over the longer term, the construction industry as a whole will need to assess the range of 
technologies available and their applicability to use-cases within this sector. The need for such an 
evaluation is at present remote. Should the industry mature in its data sharing practices, however, 
the potential for widespread and well-judged application of privacy-enhancing and other 
technologies to improve H&S information sharing will be considerable. 
 
6.3.3. Organisational framework 
Given the complexity of the construction sector and the barriers and challenges identified by this 
project, undertaking a national data sharing initiative would be difficult for the industry working in a 
decentralised way and will therefore [arguably require] an organisation - or small group of 
organisations.  
In order to realise the benefits of sharing H&S risk data, a data institution
30
 could be designed to: 
help develop the necessary infrastructure, including fostering the adoption of new standards and 
technologies; act as an independent gatekeeper of sensitive H&S risk data contributed to it by 
industry members; generate benchmarking and insights based on that data and distribute those 
insights back to members; and, where appropriate, facilitate safe access to some of the data it 
stewards, possibly to members of the industry, software vendors or to a regulator in order to 
facilitate oversight while protecting sensitive information. 
With a remit that benefits the sector, it becomes important to determine who should manage this 
organisation (or collection of). Some of the factors influencing this decision will be: 
 Perceived neutrality and trust of stewarding organisation. 
 Independence of organisation from the various members of the ecosystem. 
 Capabilities of the organisation. 
 Securing long-term and industry-wide buy-in from members of the industry. 
 Long-term sustainable resources, funding and revenue streams. 
 Internal incentives aligned to reducing incidents and the collective economic burden. 
 Instruments to mandate/incentivise the cooperation of industry organisations.

The question of sustainability deserves particular emphasis and consideration because although the 
benefits of H&S risk data-sharing to the industry as a whole are likely to be substantial, there is a 
split between where the costs of collection, management and sharing are incurred and where its 
benefits are realised.  
Sharing H&S risk data for the greater benefit of the industry is a collective action problem. The 
question of how to initiate collective action is a difficult one. One problem which surfaces is that of 
the free rider, creating a “burden on a shared resource by use or overuse by people who aren't 
paying their fair share for it or aren't paying anything at all”
31
. This is particularly a problem where 
upfront costs to establish a collective system are significant. In the case of a data sharing vehicle set 
up to benefit a wide range of users, the individual organisational benefits can be realised by 
remaining passive, not sharing data, and waiting for other organisations to take the initiative – 
creating individual value from no action. This is further complicated by those who are interested but 
do not want to take the first step, waiting for others – to learn from their successes and mistakes. 
Further work needs to be carried out to find out the most appropriate approach needed to realise 
the benefits of data sharing.  
There are existing data institutions to draw inspiration from and compare their approaches to the 
use case of sharing H&S risk data across the construction industry. Some examples are explored 
here. 
Public-sector 
DEFRA is an example of a regulator or government body performing the roles of data institution. For 
instance, since 2015 large retailers in England have been required to report information to Defra 
regarding the total number of single use carrier bags sold, the gross proceeds, any costs incurred and 
the use of the net proceeds. Retailers can be fined if they don’t submit records on time. Data is 
collected via an online survey tool which includes automatic calculations for some fields to assist the 
retailers with entering data into the system. 
In principle this example could transfer to health & safety provision in Construction. However, the 
comparison and any potential application would need careful consideration. In the DEFRA example 
above, a system was created to request data to monitor the effect of a policy to reduce carrier bag 
use. HSE already operates a Fee for Intervention System which is designed to recover costs on the 
“polluter pays” principle. However this system is focused on work carried out where a Material 
Breach is detected, and only on a reactive basis.  
The industry 
It would also be possible for members of the construction industry to perform the roles of a data 
institution. This could be done by a single organisation or a group of organisations working in 
concert. For instance, an existing construction or design firm could take on the roles of developing 
and maintaining standards and other infrastructure for the sector, acting as a gatekeeper for data 
held by other organisations or facilitating safe access to data under restricted conditions. However, a 
single firm would likely struggle to persuade competitors to take part in such an arrangement.  
Alternatively, a group of organisations within the industry could use decentralised technologies and 
distributed governance processes to enable collection, management analysis and access of H&S risk 
data on terms that are suited to the group. In the pharmaceutical industry, for instance, a group of 
 
31
 https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/free_rider_problem.asp  

52

ten pharmaceutical companies has joined together to form MELLODDY, a project that aims to 
“enhance predictive Machine Learning models on decentralised data of 10 pharmaceutical 
companies, without exposing proprietary information.” These types of decentralised approaches can 
struggle, however, to achieve sustainability without significant support from members of the 
industry and can, without appropriate forethought and stakeholder management, suffer from a lack 
of direction. 
An independent body 
There are numerous relevant examples of independent third parties that perform the roles of a data 
institution. These can be for profit or non-profit. HiLo is an example of an independent commercial 
data institution which operates within the shipping industry and supports the sharing of safety and 
accident data in the maritime sector. HiLo gathers data from shipping companies and analyses the 
aggregated dataset in order to provide actionable benchmarks and meaningful insights back to its 
members. Financially, HiLo receives subscription fees for its insight service but initially struggled to 
attract new members, wrestling with trust issues due to being independent. As a group, rather than 
delivering economic value for an industry, it focuses on delivering individual value for its subscribers 
– its discretion being a function of its trust mechanism. 
It should be noted that the industry has independent organisations such as CROSS UK and DIOHAS to 
foster greater sharing of H&S learning between organisations. Whilst these organisations cater for 
specific needs, perhaps they could serve a function of a wider H&S data sharing ecosystem.  
In the survey we asked who should be put in charge of overseeing the aggregation of H&S risk data. 
45% said an independent third party, 38% said the industry itself and 17% said a government 
regulator. This suggests that there is an appetite within the industry for an independent third party, 
however these results would need to be confirmed through further and more widespread 
engagement with industry stakeholders. Indeed, an important next step should be working with 
members of the construction industry to explore in greater depth the various technical and 
institutional options outlined here in order to understand which are most suitable and acceptable 
for the industry.

7. Recommendations and Next Steps 
 
Sharing H&S risk data is technically feasible and has merit. There are data standards that exist in the 
industry already and there is demand in the community for data-sharing. There is work needed to 
develop an organisation that can help the industry share its H&S risk data. Some initial activities can 
help to improve the success of this organisation, these include: 
Benefits:  
 Economics study: Quantify the benefits to businesses in better H&S risk data management. 
 Economics study: Further explore the other areas of potential benefits, testing the logic 
model developed in this project. 
Understanding:  
 Seminars/Papers/Training: Highlight the value of H&S risk management in project delivery. 
 Develop a guide: Detail best-practice and standards for H&S risk data management via the 
UK BIM Framework or equivalent body. 
Governance: 
 Identify the remit: Explore the purpose of this vehicle, highlighting what is in scope. 
 Funding plan: Determine a funding plan linked to long-term revenue streams, ensuring 
alignment between funder requirements/incentives and organisational incentives.
