About the ODI
ODI works to build a strong, fair and sustainable data 
economy by helping governments and businesses around the 
world get data to people who need it. It is independent, 
nonprofit and nonpartisan, founded in 2012 by 
Sir Tim Berners-Lee and Sir Nigel Shadbolt. From its 
headquarters in London and via its global network of startups, 
members and nodes, the ODI offers training, research and 
strategic advice for organisations looking to explore the 
possibilities of data. 
Since its inception in 2013, the ODI startup programme has 
supported 33 startups spread across five ‘cohorts’. Initially 
the programme focussed on businesses that placed open 
data at the core of their business model and had a 
triple   -bottom-line impact socially, environmentally and 
economically. The evolution of the data-enabled economy 
sector demonstrated that most business models, whilst 
adopting an open-innovation approach, incorporated a blend 
of open and shared data. In response to this, we broadened 
the scope of the latest cohort to include a wide range of 
data-enabled startups. 
As a whole, startups incubated by the ODI while in the 
programme have secured around £16m in sales and 
investments and directly employed more than 130 people.

Executive summary
Open and trusted health data systems can help Europe respond to 
the many urgent challenges facing its society and economy today. 
The global pandemic has already altered many of our societal and 
economic systems, and data has played a key role in enabling cross-
border and cross-sector collaboration in public health responses. 
Even before the pandemic, there was an urgent need to optimise 
healthcare systems and manage limited resources more effectively, to 
meet the needs of growing, and often ageing, populations.
Now, there is a heightened 
need to develop early-
diagnostic and health-
surveillance systems, and more 
willingness to adopt digital 
healthcare solutions.
The importance of secondary use of  
health data
By reusing health data in different ways, we can increase the 
value of this data and help to enable these improvements. 
Clinical data, such as incidences of healthcare and clinical 
trials data, can be combined with data collected from other 
sources, such as sickness and insurance claims records, and 
from devices and wearable technologies. This data can then 
be anonymised and aggregated to generate new insights and 
optimise population health, improve patients’ health and 
experiences, create more efficient healthcare systems, and 
foster innovation. 
This secondary use of health data can enable a wide range of 
benefits across the entire healthcare system. These include 
opportunities to optimise service, reduce health inequalities 
by better allocating resources, and enhance personalised 
healthcare – for example, by comparing treatments for people 
with similar characteristics. It can also help innovation by 
extending research data to assess whether new therapies 
would work for a broader population. 
To assess the policy context at European and country level, 
we drew on the ODI manifesto’s six areas for trusted and 
trustworthy data ecosystems (infrastructure, capability, 
innovation, ethics, equity and engagement) to identify 22 key 
policy components needed to achieve such an ecosystem. 
For each component, we proposed a success indicator as a 
one-sentence statement explaining how it would operate if it 
was a fully functional policy area. Finally, we evaluated these 
in two ways:
 What is the quality of policy activity for this indicator? 
The evaluation range for activities is: having only limited 
aspects of the success indicator (low); aligned intent but 
missing key aspects (medium); fully comprehensive (high).
 What progress is being made on implementation of 
policy for this indicator? 
 
The scoring range for the policy implementation stage is: 
not started (0); defined (1); planned (2); pilot initiatives (3); 
scaled-up implementations (4).
This approach allowed us to create a set of country rankings, 
and a library to demonstrate good practice or ‘what does 
good look like?’. This also means country and regional 
policymakers and ministries of health can compare 
themselves with their peers and identify approaches they can 
adapt for their own context.

Key themes and insights
Overall, there are encouraging signs that European health 
data ecosystems are maturing to support secondary use of 
health data. However, many of the initiatives are still 
fragmented and significant work is needed to establish strong 
health-data ecosystems and infrastructure for reusing data. 
Though newer policy developments are looking to coordinate 
strategies across various stakeholders, initiatives and, 
importantly, member states. 
However, one of the main challenges is the European General 
Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). While GDPR provides a 
strong foundation for secondary use of health data, 
governance tools are needed to enable data reuse. For 
example, codes of conduct, ethics committees, infrastructure 
for real-world data and real-world evidence, stronger data 
institutions, and clearer legal frameworks.
At both a country and a regional level, the lack of common 
open standards and data models is a key barrier to sharing 
data across borders. Much more work needs to be done 
 
to ensure public–patient participation in secondary use of 
health data.

How to use this report
This report is accompanied by a series of insight tools, 
including: 
 a policy framework for 22 policy components for a trusted 
data ecosystem for secondary use of health data, along 
with a success indicator for each component
   a European-wide scorecard and profile against this 
framework, with policy challenges, policy achievements, 
and good practice highlights
   a set of 29 country scorecards and profiles against this 
framework, with policy challenges, policy achievements, 
and good-practice highlights.
We have created these tools using the ODI’s Theory of 
Change for data value chains that lead to the best social and 
economic outcomes for everyone, and the ODI’s manifesto
1
 
for an open, trustworthy data ecosystem. The project 
combines EU-level policy and country-level policy of 29 key 
states – 25 EU member states, and four non-EU countries 
(Israel, Norway, Switzerland, and the UK).
The report offers an overview of the current policy and 
implementation of secondary use of health data. However, it 
can only be a starting point: secondary use of health data is a 
key health policy issue in 2021 and beyond. The methodology 
for creating the insight tools, and how you can use them to 
help organisations and individuals participate in policy 
discussions, is available in the Annexes section.

Chapter 1: The importance of secondary 
use of health data
1.1 The opportunity
An open and trusted health-data ecosystem can help Europe 
respond to the many urgent challenges facing its society and 
the economy today. A data ecosystem consists of data 
infrastructure, and the people, communities and organisations 
who benefit from the value created by it.
The global Covid-19 pandemic has already altered many of 
our societal and economic systems, and data infrastructure 
has played a key role in enabling cross-border and cross-
sector collaboration. Even before the pandemic, there was an 
urgent need to optimise healthcare systems and manage 
limited resources more effectively to meet the needs of 
growing, and often ageing, populations. Now there is a 
heightened need to develop early-diagnostic and health-
surveillance systems, and more willingness to adopt digital 
healthcare solutions.
We define secondary use of health data
2
 as:
‘The use of aggregated health data from population-
level sources, including electronic health records, 
wearable technologies, health-insurance claims 
data, health registry data (or burden of disease 
registries), clinical trials and other research, and 
drug consumption data to improve personal care 
planning, medicines development, safety 
monitoring, research and policymaking.’
Secondary use of health data plays a central role in enabling 
these improvements. It can increase the value of currently 
collected data from clinical settings, such as incidences of 
healthcare and clinical trials data, and data collected from 
other sources – such as sickness and insurance claims 
records – and from devices and wearable technologies. This 
data is often referred to as ‘real-world data’. We can then 
reuse this data, anonymised and aggregated, to improve 
people’s health and experiences, create more efficient 
healthcare systems, and foster innovation. 
2  The European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations (EFPIA) focuses on a definition of “secondary use of health data” that describes the secondary 
use of clinical health data, describing it as “the re-use of clinical trials data scientific research performed for health-related purposes other than the drug development 
program or other objective for which the clinical trial was performed”. (EFPIA (2019), ‘Safeguards framework for secondary use of clinical trial data for scientific research’.
3  ISPOR, n.d., ‘Real-World Evidence’.
4  EMA (2020), ‘Electronic Health Record: Access, Share, Expand Project’.
Secondary use of health data enables a wide range of 
benefits across the entire healthcare system. These include 
opportunities to optimise services, reduce health inequalities 
by better allocating resources, or use it to help enhance 
personalised healthcare – for example, by comparing 
treatments for people with similar characteristics. Secondary 
use of data can also help innovation by enhancing research 
data to assess whether new therapies would work for a 
broader population. Where we gain new insights from 
real-world data, this is often referred to as ‘real-world 
evidence’
3
. In this study, we analysed the infrastructure that 
supports real-world data collection and management, and 
enables decision-making based on this data.
How does a definition of secondary use of health data 
align with interpretations of the GDPR?
Our definition aims to reflect the EU’s General Data 
Protection Regulation (GDPR) definition of ‘secondary 
uses’, but in a health setting. Under GDPR, personal data 
about health includes all data about the health status of 
an individual. Using this personal data ‘for purposes other 
than those for which the data were initially collected’ is 
only allowed where the processing is compatible with the 
original purposes. Secondary use is generally allowed if it 
is necessary for carrying out a task in the public interest. 
Scientific research purposes may be permitted, where there 
is a lawful basis within a member state’s legislation

We show some secondary uses of health data and their 
potential benefits in Table 1.

Healthcare systems around the world are changing. New 
approaches to using data are enabling new treatments and 
therapies, and healthcare professionals also use data to 
enable predictive modelling and design personalised care 
plans. As we have seen with the impacts of the Covid-19 
pandemic, high-quality health data can also help 
governments and healthcare collaborative networks with 
population health management and in establishing early-
warning systems. 
With an ageing population, an increase in chronic illnesses, 
health impacts of climate change, and reduced available 
government spending in the wake of the pandemic, we 
urgently need to increase the efficiency of healthcare 
systems. Applying data insights can help optimise the 
allocation of healthcare spending, facilitate a more 
preventative-based model, encourage and enable self-
management of chronic illness, and ensure fair prioritisation 
of health resources to those with the greatest health burden.
Secondary use of health data can also include predictive 
modelling and diagnosis, at an individual or population-wide 
level. Data can be drawn from a wide range of sources that 
were not previously used or available. 
Letting healthcare innovators use health data for secondary 
purposes – that is, beyond primary care using the patient’s 
identifiable electronic health record – would help to progress 
science and innovation. This can help clinicians and others 
better understand the impact of healthcare interventions in 
real-world settings. It allows both: 
 broader analysis: as they can use data from multiple 
interventions to guide clinical decisions, and 
 narrower analysis: because they can filter data to assess 
real-world impacts on specific characteristics, such as age 
or co-morbidity.
Healthcare innovation can also expand further with real-world 
data, as people can create data flows that track and respond 
to patient needs in real-time. With the use of the Internet of 
Things, where digitally enabled devices can collect data, 
medical devices have evolved into more sophisticated tools 
that can help monitor and respond to patient health. In turn, 
these devices have given rise to new software that can help 
manage patient health automatically. Other data that could be 
used could include that sourced directly from patients, from 
government and institutional registries, and from patient 
healthcare records.

Open Data Institute 2021 / Report Secondary use of health data in Europe    10
Where secondary use of health data is implemented in data 
ecosystems with trusted data flows, there is an opportunity to 
improve health outcomes for all of society. Recent examples 
from within the ODI’s health portfolio demonstrate the 
potential:
   Covid-19 symptom tracker apps are able to collate health-
surveillance data for early diagnostics, without exposing 
personal health data.
 Data intermediaries
10
 are able to protect the privacy of 
health data while also making anonymised, aggregated 
health data available for scientific research.
 Secondary use of health data can open new markets in 
physical-activity businesses, which in turn generate greater 
preventative health opportunities for local populations.
   Competitors can share clinical-trial data on health 
challenges such as antimicrobial resistance, while still 
protecting their commercial advantage. 
10  Note that the draft European Data Governance Act defines ‘data intermediaries’ as ‘providers of data-sharing services’ that facilitate data-sharing between data holders 
and data users. The ODI defines the broader category of ‘data institutions’ of which data intermediaries are a subset as ‘organisations that steward data on behalf of 
others, often towards public, educational or charitable aims’, and whose functions can include granting data access, combining or linking data, or creating open datasets, 
among other functions.
1.2 The challenge 
Introducing new data sources into the healthcare system, 
including clinical management as well as decisions on 
regulatory and reimbursement pathways, is reshaping the 
entire healthcare management system. 
Across the health-data ecosystem, interoperability of data is 
one of the greatest challenges. In the EU, solutions must align 
with the four levels of interoperability (technical, syntactic, 
semantic, organisational), work across borders, and be drawn 
from a diverse range of health-system sections. This 
interoperability also needs to allow individual regions and 
countries to maintain autonomy in their health-policy 
decisions. For example, local values, culture, norms, and the 
organisation of healthcare as either central or regional, are all 
factors that need to be respected while ensuring 
interoperability across borders.
All stakeholders have specific needs, and face unique 
obstacles, in sharing data for health benefits. We discuss 
these in Table 2.

1.3 Data management and access in Europe
Table 3 shows nine key types of data, and who controls which and at what operational level, in the European policy setting. We 
created this non-exhaustive list as an initial set of examples, drawing on the definition of secondary use of health data provided 
above (Section 1.1). When analysing the current policy environment for secondary use, it was helpful to identify the most common 
challenges that create barriers and obstacles to the access and reuse of these datasets.

these key datasets. At a country level, understanding current access and maturity of data infrastructure helps clarify whether 
good-quality, comparative data is available for reuse.

Open Data Institute 2021 / Report Secondary use of health data in Europe    14
The ODI believes an open and trusted data ecosystem with 
the following key areas:
 Infrastructure: Sectors and societies must invest in and 
protect the data infrastructure they rely on. Open data is 
the foundation of this emerging vital infrastructure. 
 Capability: Everyone must have the opportunity to 
understand how data can, and is, being used. We need 
data literacy for all, as well as data-science skills, and 
experience using data to help solve problems.
 Innovation: Data must inspire and stimulate innovation. It 
can help businesses, governments, individuals and 
communities create products and services, leading to 
economic growth and increased productivity.
 Equity: Everyone must benefit fairly from data. Access to 
data and information promotes fair competition and 
informed markets, and helps people as consumers, 
creators and citizens.  
 Ethics: People and organisations must use data ethically. 
The choices made about what data is collected and how it 
is used should not be unjust, discriminatory or deceptive.
 Engagement: Everyone must be able to take part in 
making data work for all. Organisations and communities 
should collaborate on how they use and access data to 
help solve problems.
This model for data ecosystems can be applied to any 
jurisdiction, sector or domain. Here, we’ve used it alongside 
our analysis of country-level policy environments for 
secondary use of health data in the European region, to 
examine good practice.

2.2 Insight tool: policy framework for 
secondary use of health data
It’s challenging to find an agreed industry or government-led 
framework that describes an effective health-data ecosystem 
that supports secondary use of health data. Some work was 
done in 2007 to move towards a common understanding
12
 
but, like the challenge itself, many efforts since then have 
worked on specific aspects rather than on the whole. 
Examples include secondary use of health data for scientific 
studies
13
, and interoperability of electronic health-record 
systems
14
. Where secondary use of health data is addressed 
directly, it is usually described at country level, to document 
the legal framework necessary to make secondary use 
possible, rather than at an industry-wide view
15
.
To assess the European policy context at the pan-European 
and country level, we drew on the ODI’s six areas for open 
and trusted data ecosystems (infrastructure, capability, 
innovation, ethics, equity and engagement)
16
 to identify 22 key 
policy components needed for an open and trusted 
ecosystem for secondary use of health data.
For each of the framework components, we propose a 
one-sentence statement (called a success indicator) 
explaining how that component would operate if it was a 
fully functional policy tool, able to achieve goals – ie “what 
does good look like for this component?”. This is shown in 
Table 4. We provide a more-detailed discussion of the 
methodology and creation of this framework in the Annexes.

17  Note that the draft European Data Governance Act defines ‘data intermediaries’ as ‘providers of data-sharing services’ that facilitate data-sharing between data holders 
and data users. The ODI defines the broader category of ‘data institutions’ of which data intermediaries are a subset as ‘organisations that steward data on behalf of 
others, often towards public, educational or charitable aims’, and whose functions can include granting data access, combining or linking data, or creating open datasets, 
among other functions
For each component, we identified current policy work, 
institutional support, and strategic initiatives. We then 
evaluated these activities using two measures:
 What is the quality of policy activity for this indicator? 
The scoring range for these quality evaluations is: having 
only limited aspects of the success indicator (low / 0); 
aligned intent but missing key aspects (medium / 2); or fully 
comprehensive (high / 4).
 What progress is being made on implementation of 
policy for this indicator? The scoring range for policy-
implementation stages is: not started (0); defined (1); planned 
(2); pilot initiatives (3); scaled-up implementations (4).
2.3 Further considerations
As with any such analysis, the approach we’ve taken has 
limitations that we highlight here to aid with the interpretation 
of the results:
 The implementation scores evaluate the extent to which 
policy-makers have invested in implementation of the 
policy, but do not evaluate the effectiveness of that 
implementation, or its impact. So, for example, policy 
activity might be evaluated against the framework as high 
quality – which means there are comprehensive policy 
statements on the topic – and as having scaled-up 
implementation, but the nature of that implementation 
might still be flawed.
 The policy indicators are not evenly distributed across the 
ODI’s manifesto areas for open and trustworthy data 
ecosystems: for example, the Infrastructure policy area has 
13 indicators while the Ethics policy area has only two, so 
jurisdictions that have invested in data infrastructure policy 
while neglecting data ethics policy might still score highly 
overall. One option for mitigating this imbalance would 
have been to weight scores across each manifesto area: 
however, this may have led to a different kind of skew or 
imbalance in the results, since not all the tools or 
interventions needed to support open and trustworthy data 
ecosystems are policy tools.
 The policy indicators evaluate the readiness of the policy 
environment in the jurisdiction, but do not evaluate other 
key considerations for implementation and impact – such 
as the economic, political, and social environment. We 
have provided some of this context in the country profiles 
(see Annexes), which include data on country GDP, 
population size, GDP per capita, and Gini co-efficient for 
in-country inequalities. The extent and distribution of 
positive impact from policies to do with secondary use of 
health data will depend on these and other factors.

 Overall, Europe presents an exciting policy base for creating 
secondary use of health data. In the last two years, in line with 
the European Strategy for Data18, a health-data policy 
environment that encourages secondary use has begun to 
emerge. Policies and strategies increasingly take a joined-up 
approach. The four biggest challenges that remain are:
   Differing interpretations of GDPR and lack of clarity on how 
to enable secondary use of health data while maintaining 
Europe’s strong data privacy.
   Fragmentation of initiatives and approaches across Europe 
hindering member states’ ability to support each other or 
encourage participation from all stakeholders.
   Lack of agreed common data models and open standards, 
creating barriers for interoperability and reuse of health 
data.
   Limited focus on identifying opportunities to use 
secondary health data to reduce health inequalities.

3.1 Insight tool: EU policy scorecard
Table 5 shows a summary table of the current analysis of the 
European policy environment, assessed using the policy 
framework (for the full scorecard and profile, please see the 
Annexes). While secondary use of health data is increasingly 
identified as an opportunity in health, the digital economy, 
and data strategies, implementation is fairly new. Many 
strategies are only just starting to identify work programmes. 
We expect many changes as European policy advances over 
the coming years.

3.2 Relevant EU-wide policy 
There are two main policy areas that affect policy for 
secondary use of health data, as shown in Table 6. We have 
categorised these as:
 European vision for a data-enabled future: These 
policies and directives recognise the importance of data for 
enabling an open, innovative society and economy. This 
group of policies and legal instruments seeks to create the 
appropriate regulations, policy supports, investment and 
strategic direction that enable data to be shared to improve 
health outcomes for all people living in Europe.
 Digital transformation of healthcare: These policies, 
initiatives and institutions look to modernise aspects of the 
healthcare sector and increase interoperability, within a 
member state and across borders, and to encourage 
collaborative networks that create new solutions for 
healthcare challenges.

In many instances, these two categories of work are operating 
independently of each other. The strategies that relate to 
‘Europe’s vision for a data-enabled future’ often refer to other 
policies within that grouping. But the policies and initiatives 
within the ‘digital transformation of healthcare’ category often 
have a more independent implementation approach. This can 
be seen in the fragmentation, lack of common data models, 
and complexity of individual pilot and research studies being 
undertaken within healthcare digital-transformation efforts. The 
shortcomings of integrating this policy work were sorely tested 
during Covid-19. Implementation of electronic health records 
by EU member states often led to a lack of interoperability and 
data fragmentation across borders, and limitations in being 
able to collect and compare Covid-19 data, to assess 
infection rates and healthcare access in different regions.
There is a third, emerging, group of policy work that could 
create a bridge between these two currently disconnected 
areas. The following initiatives represent an opportunity for a 
new collaborative approach, drawing on the secondary use of 
health data. In fact, ensuring capacity for secondary-use 
purposes could be what encourages policy action, as it is a 
common element needed to achieve many of the wider policy 
goals discussed in the documents. This will involve multiple 
stakeholders from the digital, healthcare, and privacy 
domains. The key policies and initiatives behind this joined-up 
approach are:
 European Health Data Space
33
   Pharmaceutical Strategy for Europe
34
   European Medicine Authority Regulatory Science to 2025
35
   Europe’s Beating Cancer Plan
36
.
It is encouraging that, in contrast to earlier healthcare 
modernisation policies, these more recent files are able 
 
to identify the other, current, related bodies of work that 
support the acceleration of data and digitally enabled 
healthcare systems.
These documents, as shown in Figure 3, tend to be more 
recent, and ask:
   What are the health-sector implications of those policies 
that outline the European vision for a data-enabled future?
   How can current initiatives focused on digital 
transformation of healthcare incorporate the policy 
directions of the vision for a data-enabled future?

3.3 Current strategic direction
The European Commission has significant potential to create 
a cohesive ecosystem that enables the secondary use of 
health data. This will mean supporting member states must 
implement standardised, interoperable, and collaborative 
health-data strategies. The commission’s European Strategy 
for Data aims to create a consciously ethical approach, 
including strict data protection for people, and a commitment 
to strengthening data access and enabling data sharing for 
social benefit. Policies recognise the move towards collecting 
and managing ‘big data’ as an input source for innovation.
However, the fundamental change of the ‘big data’ revolution 
– that has enabled large-scale and rapid collection of detailed 
data, and new kinds of advanced data analysis or digital 
products and services – also brings challenges. Much of the 
legislation and regulation of data collection, management, 
governance and use was developed and ratified before 
big-data technological developments. Their rapid growth and 
uptake, and the associated rate of change, can make it 
difficult for policymakers to feel confident they are anticipating 
future needs, risks, and opportunities. Similarly, new potential 
uses of health data – including the secondary uses of health 
data, and personalised healthcare – are not always easily 
navigated within existing policies for health data.
There is much hope placed on the ability of the proposed 
European Health Data Space to overcome current 
fragmentation, and create a new open health-data ecosystem 
for Europe. The European Health Data Space
37
 will aim to:
   promote safe exchange of patients’ data (including when 
they travel abroad) and citizens’ control over their health data
 support research on treatments, medicines, medical 
devices and outcomes
   encourage access to, and use of, health data for research, 
policymaking and regulation, with a trusted governance 
framework and upholding data-protection rules
   support digital health services
   clarify the safety and liability of artificial intelligence (AI) in 
health.
The European Health Data Space is intended to become ‘a 
system for data exchange and access, governed by common 
rules, procedures and technical standards to ensure health 
data can be accessed within and between member states, 
with full respect for the fundamental rights of individuals’
38
.
The Joint Action Towards the European Health Data 
Space
39
 (TEHDS) is the initial step to create this network. 
Ideally, this network will take a multi-stakeholder approach 
that encourages participation by industry (including 
pharmaceutical companies), regulators, healthcare providers, 

Open Data Institute 2021 / Report Secondary use of health data in Europe    21
health surveillance and data-system operators, patient 
advocacy and consumer groups, emerging health tech 
start-ups, privacy and digital rights advocates, and 
researchers. Drawing on examples for digital government 
frameworks
40
, this network could identify key uses and 
priorities of work, facilitate the use of open standards and 
common data models, and agree to build shared services 
and common datasets that could be used as the backbone 
for industry innovation. Current work by TEHDS includes a 
summary document outlining why health data needs separate 
regulation to cover its use, to address the fragmentation 
challenges in interpreting GDPR when applied to health data.
The work of the European Medicines Agency (EMA), and 
strategies detailed in the Pharmaceutical Strategy for Europe, 
outline how foundations could be built to enable this 
collaborative data ecosystem model:
 EMA has supported the Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy 
AI
41
 and, through its Heads of Medicines Agencies (HMA)/
EMA Big Data Steering Group
42
,has outlined how these 
guidelines could help inform the work of an ethics 
committee to oversee secondary use of healthcare data, 
and help in creating a code of conduct for the health 
industry on secondary use of health data.
   Investment has led to the development of real-world data 
infrastructure (DARWIN EU: the Data Analysis and Real 
World Interrogation Network)
43
 and has supported pilot 
models that test the use of real-world data infrastructure in 
‘pharma-covigilance’ and for detecting drug-safety issues.
   It has identified the need to create standardised tools for 
health-technology assessment for use across Europe.
3.4 Key aspects of EU policies and 
implementation
We identified the following common themes as risks and 
blockers in the current policy environment, that may affect the 
development of open and trusted secondary use of health-
data ecosystems.
Governance: There are high expectations that the 
forthcoming European Health Data Space will build common 
data-governance systems. Various Europe-wide policy 
documents, and research papers aimed at understanding the 
secondary use of health data policy context, have agreed: 
   there needs to be shared agreement on data-consent 
mechanisms, codes of conduct for using and sharing data, 
common data models and data standards
 that common infrastructure needs to be built 
   that greater multi-stakeholder collaboration should be 
made easier

48  European Commission (2021), ‘Recovery and Resilience Facility | European Commission’. 
49  European Commission (2021), ‘European “1+ Million Genomes” Initiative’. 
As this work begins, through the Joint Action Towards the 
European Health Data Space, stakeholders will need to 
provide their opinions and implementation practices. This 
means industry stakeholders and member states will need to 
agree on various models and ways forward. One of the 
challenges, and part of the reason for the cycle of 
recommendations in recent years, is that there are not many 
examples of implementation and not many people expressing 
an opinion on the specific elements proposed. For example, 
open standards are proposed, but which ones to implement 
are often not stipulated. Multiple data models exist, but there 
is no agreement on which should be adopted. Sample codes 
of conduct are also often unavailable or unspecified.
Increased collaboration and exchange: Data sharing is still 
fairly minimal across Europe, outside specific initiatives. The 
ambitious 1+ Million Genomes initiative
44
, signed by 23 
countries with the aim ‘to make the personal genomic 
datasets accessible in a secure manner for collective 
diagnostic purposes and prevention, and for research and 
innovation’, found the greatest challenge was using existing 
datasets consistently and with patients’ consent. Electronic 
health-record data systems are often not advanced enough to 
be shared beyond the clinical care setting.
Quality: Across Europe, there is a wide range of initiatives in 
sub-sector domains that seek to encourage data sharing. The 
European Joint Programme on Rare Diseases
45
, for example, 
is a European health reference network aimed at improving 
clinical care and sharing data for research. There is a need for 
greater understanding for how lessons from these models 
can translate into policy for the whole of Europe and data-
ecosystem environments.
Global data flows: The economic and societal benefits of 
enabling personalised healthcare are rarely calculated and 
described in European health policy documents beyond broad 
statements that they are expected to create substantial benefits. 
A new European Partnership on Personalised Medicine
46
 has 
been identified for establishment in 2023, and recognition of the 
value of personalised healthcare is referred to in new health 
policies such as Europe’s Beating Cancer Plan
47
. This plan 
shows there are expectations that the European Health Data 
Space and the 1+ Million Genomes initiative will solve current 
challenges in the use of data for personalised healthcare.
Investment: Funding of health-system transformation is often 
limited across EU member states. Member states may be able 
to access new funding for modernising data infrastructure 
through the European Recovery and Resilience Facility
48
, as has 
been proposed by the 1+ Million Genomes initiative
49
. EMA is 
currently working on standardised tools for health-technology 
assessment. There is currently limited standardisation in models 
for collecting data on social-health insurance, which could be 
used to further optimise planning and healthcare service.

4.1 Context: country-level legislation and regulation
The EU and member-state policy cycle encourages a flow of influence and investment between the Europe-wide policy 
environment and local decisions. Under the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union
50
, the EU may set broad policy 
directives, strategies or legislation. This is then enacted on a member-state level, where investment may also be provided to build 
collaborative demonstration projects. In turn, the lessons from these initiatives influence future Europe-wide policy. This cycle of 
influence, investment and implementation is shown in Figure 4.

4.2 Insight tool: country-level scorecards
The country-level scorecards are available in the Annexes.  
As with the European Commission-level scorecard, for each 
framework component on the country-level scorecards,  
we identified current policy work, institutional support, and 
strategic initiatives. We then evaluated these activities for  
two measures:
 What is the quality of policy activity for this indicator? 
The scoring range for these quality evaluations is: having 
only limited aspects of the success indicator (low / 0); 
aligned intent but missing key aspects (medium / 2); or fully 
comprehensive (high / 4).
 What progress is being made on implementation 
 
of policy for this indicator? The scoring range for 
policy-implementation stages is: not started (0);  
defined (1); planned (2); pilot initiatives (3); scaled-up  
implementations (4).
These country-level scorecards are subject to the same 
considerations discussed around the EC-level scorecard in 
section 2.3 of this report.
51  Several countries included in this study are outside the EU and include Israel, Norway, Switzerland, and the UK, but share a location in the European region and their 
long-term relationships with healthcare systems within the European Union.
4.3 Insight tool: country profiles
The country profiles are available in the Annexes. Country 
profiles provide brief overviews of the current policy 
environment for secondary use of health data including:
   Key data: a snapshot of the countries population size, GDP, 
GDP per capita, % GDP spend on healthcare, and Gini 
coefficient for in-country inequality. 
   Chart: a visualisation of the performance of each country 
against the ODI manifesto areas
   Overview: a summary that outlines health-strategy 
incorporation of secondary use of health data, along with 
how country-level patient data-privacy legislation is 
managed.
   Policy challenges: a summary of key policy challenges 
facing further implementation of secondary use of health 
data.
   Policy achievements: a summary of where each country 
excels and shows leadership in policy.
    Good-practice highlights: a bullet-pointed description of 
the good practices within different ODI manifesto areas.
Creating accurate country profiles was challenging for a 
number of reasons:
 Centralised v distributed: Some countries have 
centralised health systems. In others, responsibility is 
devolved to autonomous regions, or they are reforming 
 
to a centralised or decentralised system. In all cases, this 
increases the number of different systems being used, 
such as electronic health-record collection and decision-
making on sharing and reuse of data, which makes it hard 
to summarise a single policy picture across an entire 
country.
 Implementation tells a different story: During validation 
of some country profiles, it became evident that while 
policy documents suggested infrastructure and data 
systems were in place, stakeholder experience suggested 
that it was not actually as advanced. For example, some 
policy documents noted a robust health-data registries 
network, but in practice data was not maintained.
 Languages locked in: While this research was conducted 
in English, we translated documents using online 
translation tools. If key strategy and policy documents were 
available only as PDFs, this was more difficult and we may 
have missed some policy initiatives and detail.

5 .1 S u m m a r y
Analysis that spans both European Commission-level 
policymaking and individual country-level policymaking can 
encourage and support Europe-wide leadership on 
secondary use of health data policy by drawing on, and 
demonstrating, country-level success.
We can use cross-country comparisons to identify where 
other countries in the region have been able to advance, 
allowing and encouraging sharing of best practices across 
Europe. Common challenges – such as fragmentation in data 
collection and lack of consistency in data-model definitions – 
can be more easily identified, and regional approaches 
proposed.
Several common themes emerged in the level of maturity of 
secondary use of health data in current country-level policy:
 Levels of investment differ: Only some countries are 
investing in managing their data infrastructure.
 Policy vision related to secondary use of health data is 
limited or incomplete: Some countries have secondary 
use of health data policies and guides, or personalised 
healthcare strategies that address this. Others have only 
documented wider goals or have broad ‘e-health’ policies 
that focus solely on electronic health-record infrastructure.
 Data infrastructure collection and quality varies: While 
most countries have some data registries available, they 
vary – some are updated regularly while others were last 
published in 2016 or earlier.

5.3 Analysis of country-level best-practice 
examples
While a summary of each country’s overall progress helps 
identify European-wide trends and opportunities, it can also 
hide areas where each country may have further work to do. 
The scoring model calculates country progress based on two 
scores: alignment with success indicators, and 
implementation progress. All countries have the opportunity 
to improve the way secondary use of health data is positioned 
in their digital-health strategies and in their level of progress. 
Looking in more detail at where each country can improve the 
openness and trustworthiness of its individual ecosystem for 
secondary use of health data, can allow more strategic action 
and help motivate countries to address gaps and obstacles.

5.3a Infrastructure
From the 22 policy components of the policy framework, we identified 13 that aligned with the ODI manifesto area of 
Infrastructure. These include individual datasets, real-world data and evidence infrastructure, and the adoption of open 
 
health-data standards. Figure 5 benchmarks the country-level policy environment for these components.

The UK, Belgium, and Denmark have invested in health-data 
infrastructure to enable secondary use of high-quality, 
comparable health datasets, and the incorporation of new 
infrastructure to support real-world data and real-world 
evidence, including for reimbursement and optimisation of 
health systems. 
The UK, for example, has aligned health-data registries and 
regularly reports on data collected in a consistent, 
standardised format. 
Belgium’s electronic health-record system is designed so that 
decentralised, regional-based health provision does not 
hinder sharing health data. Multiple health-data portals, even 
multiple portals within one health region, all draw on 
interoperable data models, so data is linked in a structured 
way. Sustainable and trustworthy data institutions ensure they 
maintain data standards. 
Denmark also has a strong health-data system, with health-
data registries regularly collected and reported. Denmark is a 
leader in implementing real-world data and real-world 
evidence infrastructures, drawing on WHO SNOMED ICD-10 
coding to ensure consistency. It has established 
Danishhealthdata.com for researchers and organisations to 
request health data.

evaluation framework for secondary use of health data when 
reviewing new health therapies and technologies. 
Austria has built a comprehensive health-technology 
assessment guide and participates in the EUnetHTA 
collaborative network, regularly reporting on decisions made.

5.3c Innovation
From the 22 policy components of the policy framework, we identified two indicators that aligned with the ODI manifesto area of 
Innovation. In this case, we focused on assessing if country-level health policies recognised the opportunity of secondary use of 
health data (for example, by explicitly mentioning secondary use in national policies). We also analysed the investment that was 
being made in electronic health-record systems as a foundation for enabling future innovation. Figure 7 benchmarks the country-
level policy environment for this component.

Equity is measured by strength of privacy regulation, and how 
clear strategies are in creating the potential to use secondary 
use of health data to reduce inequalities in access to 
healthcare, or in reducing inequalities in health outcomes of 
marginalised populations. Most countries analysed have 
developed strong data-privacy regulations, aligned with 
GDPR. However, making use of data to prioritise strategies 
that address health inequity is often not discussed when 
describing secondary use of health data, or it is discussed in 
passing in broader strategies. 
The UK’s National Health Service’ (NHS) strategies include 
using secondary health data to measure progress towards 
reducing health disparities. This includes publishing a 
health-equity dashboard

 drawn from health-registry data 
and available to local governments across the country.

5.3e Ethics
From the 22 policy elements of the policy framework, we identified two indicators that aligned with the ODI manifesto area of 
Ethics. These focused on the level of trust in healthcare systems, and the ethical and accountability framework in place for 
secondary use of health data. Figure 9, below, benchmarks the country-level policy environment for these components.

A successful ecosystem for secondary use of health data 
requires the trust of people and patients. Initiatives that  
build trust in sharing data – and ethical and accountability 
frameworks that ensure consent and provide redress –  
are essential. 
In  Sweden, under the life-sciences roadmap, which includes 
strategic goals for secondary use of health data, they have 
established a Committee for Technological Innovation and 
Ethics, to oversee use of data for personalised medicine. 
Israel has instituted clear approval processes for secondary 
use of health data, and has established a legal framework for 
ensuring the data is de-identified prior to reuse. 
Lithuania has established ‘sandbox’ environments that isolate 
health data for use in developing AI tools. This enforces 
data-management standards, but there is still work to be 
done to overcome fragmentation in data-collection systems. 
Lithuania’s challenge in overcoming data fragmentation has 
not prevented it moving towards an ethical and accountability 
framework for secondary use of health data, showing that 
countries can still progress towards open-data ecosystems 
while addressing shortcomings.

5.3f Engagement
From the 22 policy components of the policy framework from Chapter 3, we identified two indicators that aligned with the 
ODI-manifesto area of Engagement. This focused on investment and initiatives to ensure public and patient participation in data 
ecosystems, and sustainable and trustworthy data institutions. Figure 10 benchmarks the country-level policy environment for 
these components.

Enabling patient and public participation in how health data is 
used is essential for open and trusted data ecosystems. 
There are few structures evident where patients are involved 
in the emerging infrastructure and institutions that govern 
secondary use of health data. 
Finland has an admirable infrastructure, with initiatives such 
as FinnGen, and the work of Sitra, enabling greater 
community and patient involvement in decision-making. 
However, initiatives still suffer from being unconnected, and it 
can be difficult to see how patients can participate as a group 
and individually across all secondary use of health data 
initiatives.

An open, trusted data ecosystem for secondary use of health 
data enables the use and sharing of data, encourages the 
adoption of personalised healthcare, and increases efficiency 
and innovation in the health system.
Many of these ecosystem elements are needed at a pan-
European level, but will be informed by implementations and 
policy decisions at a country level. Table 8 provides an 
overview of the work needed at the Europe-wide level to 
foster a this data ecosystem for secondary use of health data. 
Decision-making will need examples and agreements at the 
country level to highlight demonstrations of how these 
elements work locally, to inform collaborative policy action. 
Therefore, there is the opportunity at country level to influence 
European policy, by clarifying implementation frameworks for 
each of the following areas.

Open Data Institute 2021 / Report Secondary use of health data in Europe    34
6.1 Infrastructure
Policy needed: 
   A common data language and infrastructure
A commitment to data governance is needed across Europe’s 
healthcare-data ecosystem. Newer health-policy documents, 
such as the Europe’s Beating Cancer Plan, recognise the 
need to establish centralised data registries that use common 
data models for all of Europe. Approaches to generating open 
standards for health-data models are urgently needed. 
Before developing common data models, it is essential to 
study the work already undertaken. This is crucial for health 
where, under the various pilots and initiatives (including the 
European Health Reference Networks and eHealth Digital 
Services Infrastructure), a lot of work has already been done 
but is at risk of duplication, or of adopting new standards and 
models that are not aligned with previous work.
The cross-sector nature of data relevant to personalised 
healthcare also brings both opportunities and challenges. Key 
datasets for personalised healthcare might have origins or 
uses beyond the traditional healthcare sector, and the 
interdependencies or data flows across sectors can influence 
policy norms. The cross-sector nature of the ecosystem for 
health data can mean policymakers for legislation and 
regulation of the secondary uses of health data must consider 
frameworks and norms beyond the health domain. But it is 
also an opportunity for policymakers in health to draw on, or 
learn from, good practice in other domains and sectors, and 
to be influenced by the wider benefits of a trusted ecosystem 
for health data beyond the health domain.
6.2 Capability
Policy needed:
 Improved data skills for all stakeholders
The ODI’s Data Skills Framework
53
 describes the range of 
skills needed by various stakeholders in an open-data 
ecosystem. Skills in managing data ecosystems, beyond 
technical data skills, are required by multiple stakeholders: 
policy, healthcare practitioners, researchers, regulators, and 
consumer-advocacy groups.
53  ODI (2020), ‘Data Skills Framework’.
6.3 Innovation
Policy needed: 
   Common health-technology assessment instruments
   Agreement on governance and use of patient-reported 
outcomes, wearables and other consumer health data
 The work by EMA on health-technology assessment will be 
essential to building new models of reimbursement, and to 
financing for new treatments and approaches built on 
secondary use of health data.
At present, there are limited European examples of patient-
reported health outcomes and wearable and other sensor-
based technology health data being collected and used as 
part of an ecosystem for secondary use of the health data. 
Again, new models of governance, data collection, and 
appropriate reuse infrastructure will support innovation, 
drawing on these emerging health datasets. 
6.5 Equity
Policy needed: 
 Opportunities for secondary use of health data to improve 
health access and care-planning for population groups 
need to be prioritised
One of the greatest benefits of secondary use of health data 
is that it can enable new treatments and solutions that meet 
the needs of smaller population groups. Traditional healthcare 
systems often build evidence by screening out any 
characteristics that may reduce wider application of proposed 
clinical solutions. 
Secondary use of health data allows data from previous 
clinical studies, observational studies and electronic health 
records to be analysed by sub-population characteristics. 
This could mean early diagnosis and screening, and 
personalised healthcare solutions, can be created to suit each 
patient individually. This is often a data-quality question. 
Ensuring representative data collection, correcting for bias in 
data and research design, and enabling use and analysis, 
would improve data quality. This would enable a focus on 
secondary-use purposes that reduce inequitable distribution 
of health and health-resource allocation. 
This is recognised as one of the benefits of secondary use of 
health data when working on solutions targeting rare 
diseases. But it is not often applied to personalised 
healthcare or diagnosis opportunities for marginalised groups 
that continue to face health inequalities in access and 
treatment outcomes. Secondary use of health data can be 
used for improved health-service planning to target 
concentrated areas of disadvantage. It can also be used to 
create new reimbursement structures and clinical-care cost 
calculations, where care is provided for patients with a history 
of inequitable healthcare access and health outcomes.

Open Data Institute 2021 / Report Secondary use of health data in Europe    35
6.4 Ethics
Policy needed:
   Standardised models of consent for sharing data
   Clearer harmonisation of GDPR to define processes for 
data-privacy methodologies 
 Established ethics processes 
Greater clarification is needed to harmonise and support the 
GDPR implementations that enable secondary use of health 
data. GDPR ensures all European citizens and residents have 
the right to privacy, and access to their data. Health data is 
recognised as highly sensitive, needing additional safeguards 
to protect citizens. Because secondary use of health data can 
make use of anonymised, aggregated data at a population-
wide level to advance scientific research, several Recitals, 
such as Recital 157, aim to provide greater clarity on when 
sensitive personal data can be used for health research. 
However, individual EU member states may interpret these in 
different ways. Some accept the findings of Recital 157 (such 
as Austria) and some do not (such as Finland). To clarify some 
areas of legislation, individual member states have enacted 
national data-privacy legislation that reflects key 
characteristics of GDPR but also strengthens or defines other 
areas such as secondary use of health data.
In  France, for example, legislative guidelines limit recognition 
of anonymised health data and its use for future research. 
Finland has introduced new legislation to enable secondary 
use of health data. In the Netherlands, strict interpretations of 
GDPR have limited the health data for use in AI. In Germany, 
laws allow data to be used for scientific research, but private 
industry is specifically excluded.
Greater clarity is needed at a Europe-wide level on 
appropriate interpretation of GDPR and its implementation for 
reuse of anonymised health data for research, diagnostic, and 
personalised healthcare purposes.
The European Data Governance Act proposes new models 
for data altruism, meaning citizens agreeing to share their 
data for research or social good. There is a proposal for a 
new, dynamic consent-mechanism model that would allow 
citizens to consent for multiple purposes at the same time. At 
present, GDPR requirements and interpretations across 
Europe rarely grant approval to data access for research 
purposes. The establishment of an ethics committee, with 
patient and consumer participation, would help create the 
infrastructure needed. The recognition by EMA and other 
bodies of the ethics guidelines for trustworthy AI could also 
be used as a basis for secondary use of health data.
54  DG Health and Food Safety,(2021), ‘Assessment of the EU Member States’ rules on health data in the light of GDPR’. 
6.6 Engagement
Policy needed:
   Ability for a wide range of entities to participate in health-
data networks, including commercial stakeholders such as 
new health start-ups and pharmaceutical companies
   Involvement of patient-advocacy groups
There must be support for a multi-stakeholder network to 
participate in a data ecosystem that supports secondary-use 
purposes. At present, commercial entities are sometimes 
reluctant to participate in healthcare networks that encourage 
the secondary use of health data for innovation, diagnostics, 
and personalised healthcare. However, recent reviews of the 
separation between non-commercial and industry use have 
recognised that the lines are often blurred
54
. Industry 
collaborates with academia and government to help finance 
and create healthcare solutions for social good. Industry 
stakeholders need to be invited to participate in new 
structures, including the European Health Data Space.
Trust in healthcare systems and appropriate secondary use of 
health data also needs a participating patient network. Data is 
also often collected by individuals through wearable and other 
technologies, and people need to participate in discussions 
on consent to secondary use. Patient-advocacy groups need 
to be part of open health-data ecosystems.
