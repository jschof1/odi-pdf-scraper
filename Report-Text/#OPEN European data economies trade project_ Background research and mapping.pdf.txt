About this report
From April 2018 to March 2019, the Open Data Institute will be working to support international
trade opportunities for data-enabled businesses - in particular, in Germany, France, the
Netherlands, and Belgium. The ODI commissioned this report from Oxford Insights to help inform
its decisions about how best to invest time and effort in 2018-19.

Summary
This report is a high-level analysis of the data economies of Germany, France, the Netherlands, and
Belgium: ‘sizing the prize’, mapping out key stakeholders, and assessing the impetus for change.
Our emphasis was breadth rather than depth, with a view to directing future research and
development resources.
Our analysis is divided by country, with each consisting of the following sections: mapping the data
economy; an overview of relevant data-related legislation and regulation, including the likely impact
of GDPR; high-level qualitative mapping of the finance, transport, artificial intelligence, healthcare,
and energy and utilities sectors.
The four countries reviewed are all making strong progress both in opening up and capitalising on
the value of data, but this progress is uneven across countries and sectors.
National data economies: an overview
Different pictures emerged of the data economies in each of the countries we studied. The four
economies range in size: Germany is the largest economy in the EU, France the 3rd, the
Netherlands is 6th and Belgium 9th.However, in termsof the EU’s Digital Economy and Society
1
Index (DESI), which measures digital performance and competitiveness, the most advanced digital
economy of this group is the Netherlands, which is 4th, and Belgium is 6th, while Germany and
France lag behind them at 11th and 17th respectively.Digital progress is not dictated purely by
2
economic might.

story: France is the leader here, in 3rd place, while the Netherlands (20th), Belgium (22nd) and
Germany (24th) all perform relatively poorly given their high DESI rankings and large economies.

The International Data Corporation’s 2017 reportinto the European data market reports on the
6
value of the data market for each country. These findings are displayed in the graph below. In the
EU, Germany’s data market is the most valuable, France’s is third, e Netherlands’ is sixth and
Belgium’s is eighth. As per IDC analysis, this suggests that all the countries studied here already
have relatively high market penetration of data products and services. All are therefore theoretically
well positioned to take advantage of the economic benefits of the data economy.

High-level sector mapping: an overview
Finance
All of the countries studied here have reasonably strong and growing FinTech sectors. There is also
a trend of banks in these countries successfully collaborating with tech firms and taking advantage
of the opportunities presented by big data and new technologies. They have varying rates of
consumer FinTech adoption amongst the digitally active population, however (as displayed in the
graph below): Germany leads with 35 percent; France has 27 percent; Netherlands has 27 percent;
and Belgium and Luxembourg together have 13 percent (the average of countries studied was 33
percent).

In the Netherlands, there is political will to drive the FinTech sector, with the 2017 coalition
agreement explicitly recognising the value of innovative financial technology and recognising the
need for relaxing regulation to foster innovation. Applications of big data in banking is one of the
focus areas of the country’s Commit2Data programme. The Belgian government has similarly
acknowledged the value of the sector, with Finance Minister Johan van Overtveldt seeking to build
bridges with UK FinTech firms to maintain links after Brexit. The German government has, amongst
other measures, set up FinCamps to promote dialogue with German FinTech companies. The
French government has similarly sought to attract FinTech from the UK after Brexit.
Transport
Given the integrated nature of Europe’s transport network, there is a significant amount of EU-level
cooperation and initiatives involving big data and tech to improve transport. All four countries are
part of the EU’s C-Roads project, which aims to use tech to enable vehicles to communicate with
one another as part of a move towards a smart roads network.
At a national level, there is a policy focus on intelligent transport and autonomous vehicles, with
governments such as Germany and the Netherlands stating their intentions to make progress in
these areas. There has been significant private sector innovation in the transport sphere, as seen in
the success of companies such as German taxi-hailing app Mytaxi and French ride-sharing app
BlaBlaCar. There is also a trend of more traditional transport industry giants investing in innovative
new tech companies, such as Daimler buying a share of Mytaxi, Volkswagen investing in
taxi-hailing app Get, and TomTom buying a self-driving car startup.

Artificial intelligence
Under Macron, France is taking a number of steps to reverse its traditionally anti-tech,
anti-entrepreneur image. AI has been a focal point of the current administration, including the
country becoming one of the first ten in the world to publish a national AI strategy (#FranceIA), and
Macron recently announcing €1.5 billion of investment into AI research.Germany, the
10
Netherlands and Belgium currently do not have comprehensive national AI strategies, although the
German and Dutch governments seem to be more committed than the Belgian government to
making AI a national priority area based on statements and policy documents.
Source: Asgard
11
In the private sector, the capital cities of each of these countries except Belgium are major tech
hubs: Berlin, Paris and Amsterdam are the 2nd, 3rd and 6th biggest AI startup hubs in Europe
respectively.Germany also has Munich at 5th positionand Frankfurt at 11th, and the Netherlands
12
has the Hague at 13th. Although Belgium tends to lag behind the other three countries in terms of
its AI sector, it does still have two of the top 15 hubs of AI talent in Europe: Brussels (12th) and
Antwerp (14th).
13
At the EU level, there is the issue that amounts of data available for training algorithms for AI is very
different to, for example, the US, where there are huge data lakes held by commercial companies,
or China, where Alibaba can be trained using government data. The fragmented nature of data
across the EU limits the speed of developing AI.

Healthcare
Most countries have struggled with the issue of how to handle personal privacy when considering
how to capitalise on patient data to enable large-scale digitisation of healthcare. Belgium and
France have recently announced new regulations or amendments to existing regulations to address
this, but cumbersome regulation remains a limitation to eHealth in Germany, in particular.
All the countries included in this report recognise the potential of eHealth and the need to digitise
healthcare, but large-scale digitisation seems to remain fairly elusive. The Netherlands, Belgium and
Germany have established or plan to establish ‘Health Valleys’ to encourage cooperation between
the public and private sector to foster innovations in the field of eHealth. This is a key area in which
other governments may learn from the UK, as the NHS is a good example of the opening up of
selected healthcare data, and how this can be used to make the system more efficient.
Energy and utilities
Across Europe, governments are seeking to make the transition toward greater use of renewable
energy sources, a process which most recognise will require greater reliance on digital technologies
and the use of big data. Smart networks featuring smart grids and smart meters to transmit data
on energy consumption are an extremely popular innovation in all four countries and a useful
source of big data. Using this data is not always straightforward, as seen in the Netherlands where
public-private energy transporters can be forced to turn down open data requests due to privacy
concerns and contractual confusion around the conditions under which public and private entities
and individuals share their data into the pool.
15
Partly as a result of EU directives to liberalised energy markets, there has been major innovation
taking place in the energy sectors of the countries in this report. This has led to movement away
from traditional oligopolies consisting of a small number of energy giants in each country, which
has created space in the market for smaller digital and data-driven companies to flourish. As a
result, start-ups are springing up with solutions for problems such as how to optimise energy use
using customer data, and how to store energy from renewable sources. The field of ‘clean tech’
startups in each of these countries is rapidly developing and highly innovative, and will be worth
monitoring closely over the coming years.

Defining the data economy
There is a lack of consensus regarding the definition of a data economy. We considered a number
of possible definitions, including an attempt to crowdsource a definition on social media (with
limited success). Ultimately, the definition we have settled on for the purposes of this report follows
most closely that used by the Big Data Value Association (an EU Commission strategic partner):
The data economy is the total social and economicvalue derived from using data.
When measuring the data economy, there are a number of possible indicators to take into account.
As per the International Data Corporation’s report on the European data market,these include the
16
total number of data workers (those who collect, store, manage and analyse data), companies that
produce and deliver data-related products and services, and the value of the overall data market.

Germany
Mapping the data economy
Germany is the economic powerhouse of Europe. It is the fourth
largest economy in the world, and the largest in the EU,
accounting for around 21 percent of total EU GDP.As of 2017,
17
it is the second fastest growing economy in the G7 (after
Canada), with a growth rate of 0.6 percent in the first quarter of
that year.Additionally, employment in the countryhas increased
18
by over 10 percent over the last decade.Germany’sstrengths
19
as a large, fast-growing economy with increasing employment
mean that it is well placed not only to manage, but to take
advantage of, disruption caused by technological change.
Germany’s GDP is forecast to potentially increase by €82 billion if
German businesses capacity to exploit digital technologies is
fully realised.However, thus far digital progresshas tended to
20
lag behind other indicators, and Germany ranks 11th in the
2017 Digital Economy and Society Index..
21
The country’s ‘Digital Strategy 2025’emphasisesthe idea that data is the backbone of
22
Germany’s planned digital transformation. It also explicitly references the value of data to
businesses and the economy: “how data is handled is a decisive factor in the success of modern
business...in the long run, the key competencies of successful companies will revolve around
collecting, processing, linking and protecting data”.The need to ensure that manufacturing
23
companies, production sectors and other businesses can continue to compete with new market
players with superior understanding of data is recognised as an urgent priority for policymakers to
address.
24
Data was also a key theme in the recent Coalition Agreement,signalling the country’s
25
commitment to focus on digital policy and data as a central dependency for this. This is a change
in approach, as Germany has not previously had a strong focus on data openness, and is only a

recent member of the Open Government Partnership (2016).Pledges included a new law on
26
open data, an intensive review of data protection in mid-2020, and the prioritisation of data as a
central dependency of the new goal to spend 3.5 percent of GDP on areas including AI and
digitisation. Additionally, Germany plans to establish an e-Government agency to carry out pilots
with the aim of improving public services and governance.The government also announced a
€500 million commitment to help ensure that citizens’ data is used in a transparent manner,
including exploring the possibilities offered by Blockchain for public authorities. Germany has also
committed to a national research data infrastructure, to help standardise and improve access to
banks of data.
27
As well as this action from central government, which has contributed to Germany improving its
rank in EU’s Open Data readiness index from 20th in 2016 to 17th in 2017,there is significant
28
‘bottom-up’ impetus, from both the state level, and citizens. (Examples of state-level legislation
promoting open data are discussed in the ‘key legislation and regulation’ section of this chapter,
below). The drive by citizens and businesses for open data can be seen in the abundance of
hackathons organised throughout Germany, and the number of startups that applied for the
European Commission’s Open Data Incubator for Europe programme (133, meaning the country
ranked third after the UK and Spain).The countrycontinues to lag in open data rankings,
29
however, behind its European economic rivals: it is currently 24th in the Global Open Data Index,
behind Britain (2nd), France (3rd), the Netherlands (20th) and Belgium (22nd).This is at least in
30
part due to the country’s historically strong stance on protecting individuals’ data.
According to Financial Times analysis from 2017,German industry is lagging when it comes to
31
taking advantage of the opportunities afforded by big data and digital disruption. Although
Germany is an economic powerhouse and home of automobile industry giants such as BMW,
Audi, and Mercedes-Benz, many fear that digitisation could undermine Germany’s position of
economic strength, and that Germany’s ‘old’ industries are not well placed to cope with digital
disruption. As German Chancellor Angela Merkel said in 2014:“We have the opportunity for a
digital economic miracle. The question is whether or not it will happen in Germany”.
If German industry does not digitally transform, it risks a decline in industrial value added of €220
billion by 2025.German companies could instead becomesubcontractors for digital platforms
32
that connect consumers and hardware products. Germany’s response to the risk of disruption
posed by tech giants thus far has tended to be additional regulation, such as the banning of Uber
and Airbnb in several major cities. There is uncertainty over whether Germany has the capacity or

Data legislation and regulation
Key legislation and regulation
The 2018 coalition agreement confirms Germany’s long-held commitment to implementing
regulation to protect its citizens’ data. The agreement lays out the country’s plans to introduce an
ePrivacy regulation in line with GDPR.If there isa delay in the EU’s ePrivacy Regulation (beyond
34
the anticipated deadline of 25 May 2018), then any legislative loopholes will be addressed through
national legislation which will put into action the ePrivacy Directive 2002/58/EC (GDPR’s
predecessor), as well as the German Telemedia Act.
35
Aside from GDPR and the ePrivacy regulation, the State Secretary for Economic Affairs Matthias
Machnig presented a white paper on digital platforms at the 2017 CeBIT fair.This white paper
36
represents what would be the country’s first comprehensive set of rules for a digital regulatory
policy, with Section 3.2 entitled ‘Creating a modern data economy’. This states that “an innovative,
data-centred economy with a strong industrial base is the European model to secure prosperity”.
37
The paper outlines a number of steps for the government to“politically accompany the creation of
a modern data economy”:
38
●
Establish a clear legal framework for data usage;
●
Advance seal and certification solutions for greater transparency, using GDPR as a
foundation for more data sovereignty and portability;
●
Introduce basic transparency and information duties for digital platforms;
●
Make online business transactions and e-Government simpler and more secure by passing
a Trust Services Act (VDG) on the basis of the EU’s requirements for trust services (the
eIDAS Regulation), to make it easier for the public, businesses and authorities to verify
identities;
●
Establish ‘experimentation rooms’ or ‘real laboratories’ for innovative digital networked
business models.
Although it is still unclear whether these proposals will be enacted into law, they represent a
commitment from the Ministry of the Economy to advancing the creation of a data economy in the
country. As such, it is worth following the development of these proposals going forward.

Germany’s first federal Open Data law came into effect on 13 July 2017. The law amended the
earlier e-Government law,and seeks to make Germangovernment data ‘open by default’.The
3940
law establishes a legal basis for citizens to access information from public authorities, as well as
providing clarity for providers as to what must be published. It stipulates that this data must be
provided in a machine-readable format, and that the government will establish a central data
agency to support public authorities on questions reading open data provision, as well as to act as
a central contact point for regional authorities. Expected benefits of the law include better public
sector products and services, as well as new digital transformation growth areas and better
management in the private sector, due to the availability of more high quality data. The German
Ministry of Interior, which presented the bill, forecast that this will generate up to €130 billion of
economic gains over the next decade.In a statementfollowing the adoption of the Federal Open
41
Data Act, a parliamentary spokesperson commented on the potential value of this data: “the
systematic publication of administrative data...creates opportunities for startups and SMEs...and
therefore the basis for data driven business models are laid”.
42
The Open Government Partnership, however, lists a number of exemptions the Open Data Law:
43
●
It only covers data in electronic form (written documents are exempt);
●
The law does not cover the regional authorities (Bundesländer),and thus only applies to
data from authorities directly subordinate to the federal government (though several states
have their own open data policies, as described below);
●
Universities and research bodies indirectly subordinate to the federal government are
exempt.
Organisations such as the Open Government Partnershiphave been lobbying the German
44
government to agree to commit to an open data law since 2013,when their efforts were focused
45
on getting the government to include a statement on the matter in their coalition agreement. They
did so on the basis that “the inclusion of such phrases [as ‘open data law’] is crucial in the
law-making process because it provides a point of reference for future lobbying efforts, especially
once the topic is out of the public’s attention”.This makes the 2018 coalition agreement
46
particularly pertinent, with its pledge to introduce a new law on open data, to “assess opportunities
for citizens and government authorities inherent in open data”.At present, further details of this
47
proposed legislation are elusive, but it potentially represents a major opportunity to help German
businesses extract value from data.

As well as this top-down action from the federal government, which also included acceding to the
Open Government Partnership in late 2016, there has been significant impetus for open data from
the federal state level.Transparency laws have beenadopted in the states of Bremen, Hamburg
48
and Rhineland-Palatinate, whilst North Rhine-Westphalia is drafting its own Open Data Act.
49
Germany remains a staunch advocate of personal data protection and has played a key role in EU
privacy legislation, partly as a result of historic factors such as the country’s legacy as a police state
during the Cold War. In response to the recent Facebook-Cambridge Analytica scandal, the Justice
Minister Katrina Barley announced plans to pass new laws on social media to enable tighter
supervision of companies like Facebook and allocate more power to the central government to
punish data protection violations.Such a law wouldbe a further layer of regulation for social
50
media giants, who were also recently subject to controversial new law the Network Enforcement
Act (known as NetzDG), under which platforms face fines of up to €50 million if they do not remove
‘obviously illegal’ hate speech within 24 hours of being notified of it.The Act came into force on1
51
January 2018, prompting Facebook and Twitter to add extra features for flagging content, and hire
and train moderators. The legislation has provoked controversy as critics say it could curtail free
speech.
Impact of GDPR and the European ePrivacy Regulation
Due to a lack of clarity on both the final wording and timelines of the ePrivacy regulation,
organisations which use electronic communications services may struggle with preparations for the
new regulation.There is an ongoing rush by manybusinesses to create and own consumer login
52
systems, to help their businesses adapt to new ePrivacy laws, in the event that they will require
consumer consent for cookie use.This has resultedin cross-industry ‘login collectives’, or
53
‘alliances’comprised of publishing groups and non-publisherpartners. These combine national
54
newspapers such asBildandDie Weltwith industrygiants such as car manufacturers Daimler,
insurance firm Allianz, Deutsche Bank, Lufthansa, and Deutsche Telekom. The aim of these
alliances is to create single sign-in platform for all customers, to allow people to more easily
manage the data that businesses hold on them. This is to help businesses compete with the tech
giants such as Amazon and Google after GDPR comes in, as these companies already hold vast
quantities of login data and in theory will more easily be able to communicate new consent
requirements to customers than those with non-logged in or registered audiences.

There is also concern among publishers that they could lose up to 30 percent of income from
digital advertising sales, as a result of the new EU ePrivacy Regulation, an amount equivalent to
around €300 million.This adds to ongoing concernsabout the relative advantage held by big
56
platform operators when GDPR and new ePrivacy regulations are implemented. Dr Rudolf
Thiemenn, President of the Association of German Magazine Publishers (Verband Deutscher
Zeitschriftenverleger,or VBZ),has called on theGerman government to oppose the new EU
regulation as a result.

story of Germany’s digital economy: it is
estimated that around 87 percent of
German banks currently work with
FinTech organisations.Germany has a

strong and growing FinTech landscape,
with an estimated 300 FinTechs in total,
employing 13,000 people, attracting
increasing investment flows and being
used by around 35 percent of the

multipleFinTech hubs around the
country, including Berlin, Hamburg,
Frankfurt and Munich, as demonstrated
by the map on the right. Models of
collaboration between financial
institutions and FinTechs takes a variety
of forms, the most widespread of which
involves financial institutions relying on

●
Regulatory issues, including very dense and complex legislation, which is expensive for
businesses and potentially an issue for startup FinTechs.
The government has recently taken a number of steps to improve regulation to encourage
FinTechs. Major steps taken include:
65
●
Reforming tax rules regarding carrying forward losses, to help remove obstacles that
prevent new businesses gaining access to capital;
●
New legislation to introduce the EU’s second Payments Services Directives which should
permit the growth of new business models, as it mandates access to payment accounts
held by credit institutions for approved service providers.

from investors led by Chinese internet and social media giant, Tencent, and Allianz X, the insurance

67
Transport
It is a stated priority of the Federal Ministry of Transport and Digital Infrastructure (BMVI) to
accelerate the employment of intelligent transport systems.This is particularly focused on
68
intelligent vehicle and road systems which can improve road safety, and make travel more efficient
and more environmentally friendly. The Ministry is promoting such systems not only at the national
level, but also seeking to cooperate with other European partners. As a result, the Ministry has
helped to draw up a European directive for the use of intelligent transport systems, to encourage
their adoption and cooperation. They have also produced a National Intelligent Transport Systems
Action Plan for road travel, covering the period to 2020.
69
According to BCG analysis of seven sectors in Germany, the logistics and transportation sector is
likely to see the fewest changes from digitisation, partly because the sector already makes
substantial use of digital technologies and processes.Applications such as Uber and Mytaxi are

extremely popular in Germany, and have transformed the way people access taxi services. Mytaxi
is a Hamburg-based start up,which now employs 600people across Europe and South

73
announced it would not be renewing Uber’s license in London, the CEO of Mytaxi Andrew
Pinnington announced his intention for Mytaxi to capitalise on the opportunity.
74
German automobile giant Daimler has a 60 percent stake in Mytaxi - primarily for its data, to help
Daimler develop their own autonomous vehicle programme.This is also part of a broader trend of
75
automobile giants investing in tech startups, at least in part due to the access to customer data this
provides: Daimler have also invested in British mapping company what3words,while Volkswagen
76
have invested in taxi app Gett.These actions suggestthat the traditional manufacturing giants of
77
the automobile sector in Germany are actively seeking opportunities to capitalise on the data
economy in this sector.
Artificial intelligence
According to research carried out by venture capital firm Asgard, the most significant fields for AI
startups in Germany (accounting for 48 percent of German AI startups) are:
78
●
Customer support;
●
Customer communication;
●
Sales and marketing;
●
Software development;
●
Computer vision/image recognition.
Around 54 percent of these AI startups are located in Berlin, making the city the fourth largest AI
hub in the world after Silicon Valley, London and Paris.
79
Two of the ten best-funded European artificial intelligence companies are based in Germany.
Arago,which works on process automation and generalproblem-solving AI, is based in Frankfurt,
80
while KONUX,an Internet of Things company whichhelps to monitor and improve infrastructure
81
and operations, is based in Munich. Berlin-based startups had a good year in 2017, raising €2.97
billion, up from €1.1 billion in the previous year. This made the city second only to London among
European tech hubs for raising investment.

Healthcare
According to advisory firm Brunswick’s commentary,Germany has unfavourable conditions for
86
the digitisation of healthcare in comparison with other European neighbours. This is due to a
number of factors:
●
Out-of-date healthcare policy, with outdated regulations and excessive data protection
requirements;
●
Sustainable investments in healthcare innovations are scarce;
●
Patient-system communication are outdated, e.g. there is a ban on remote diagnosis and
treatment and mail-order prescription drugs.
McKinsey also recently found that three out of five German hospitals lack a digitisation strategy.
87
85 percent of hospital directors say that the progress toward digitisation at their own hospitals is
‘inadequate’.Brunswick attribute this lack of progressto all parts of the system, including the

‘digitally aversive’ medical professionals, the ‘legislatively ignorant’ medical market, and a digital
infrastructure currently not set up for the integration of apps.
They call on politicians to lobby for and drive change, with the Federal Joint Committee having
acknowledged the problems with the situation. Federal Minister for Economics and Energy Brigitte
Zypries has long been an advocate for the digitisation of healthcare, and has previously put forward
a list of demands to improve the current situation. The change, Brunswick argue, will come from
the startup scene - but is currently being stymied by a lack of clarity over regulation.Last yearthe
89
government named the Bavarian Medical Valley the Digital Hub for Health.The ‘Valley’ fosters
90
collaboration between business, science, healthcare and politics, and is similar to the Health
Valleys of the Netherlands and the planned one in Belgium.
The German Institute of Medical Documentation and Information (DIMDI)is the online publisher of
91
medical standards and classifications. It develops and runs database systems for drugs, medical
devices and healthcare data. Part of DIMDI is a data trust,established in 2014, responsible for
92
pseudonymisation healthcare data from statutory health insurance funds to help analyse the
country’s healthcare situation. The system is funded by the health insurance funds.
The German medical device market is Europe’s largest, and the third largest in the world (its
estimated worth in 2014 was $26 billion).It combinesmajor players with a majority of small- and
93
medium-sized companies. There is significant demand for new and innovative medical
technologies within the German market.
94
Energy and utilities
As part of its digital agenda, the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy is funding
pre-commercial research and development projects.The smart data programme is looking for
widely applicable big data solutions in key sectors including energy, mobility and healthcare.
95
The Digital Agenda also launched the ‘Smart Networks’ initiative, which aimed to make better use
of the social and economic opportunities from digital networking (or the optimised use of ICT) in
sectors including energy, health and transport.Innovationsinclude the Smart Gridand Smart

through the Act on the Digitisation of the Energy Transition.
99
There is significant innovation taking place around energy in the private sector, which is evolving
away from being concentrated around the traditional model of a small number of energy providers.
Startups are helping to solve problems such as how to store energy from renewable sources for
later use, or how to make energy usage in the home more efficient. Thermondo, for example, is a
German startup which uses customer data analytics to provide highly customised heating
solutions, with their business model centred around improving customer interaction points.

France
Mapping the data economy
France is the third-largest economy in the European Union after Germany and the United Kingdom,
comprising around 15 percent of EU GDP.Its GDP growthsaw a significant increase in 2017
101
compared with 2016, rising from 1.2 percent to 1.8 percent.In 2013, McKinsey measured
102
France’s ‘digital GDP’ at €113 billion, or 5.5 percent of its GDP. McKinsey also suggests that this
has the potential to grow to €276 billion, or 10.8 percent of GDP, by 2020.However, this would
103
require French businesses to overcome what McKinsey described as a resistance to using digital
techniques.They state that this is due to a generalinability to invest in digital and innovate due to
104
small margins in certain companies and limited interest in digital from those at the top level of some
firms. For example, where 26 percent of German companies took online orders in 2013, the same
was true for only 14 percent of French firms.
105
Despite these apparent limitations in the private sector, French government policy has not
neglected big data. In 2014, the French government included big data as an important element in
creating a ‘New Industrial France’,releasing a BigData Road Map. This sought to create or
106
support 137,000 jobs, with a focus on employment in the IT industry or IT-related tasks within
firms.In 2016, the New Industrial France projectlaunched a Big Data Observatory designed to
107
measure 40 sectors’ progress in using big data.
108
France has also demonstrated its commitment to international cooperation in search of data and
digital-driven economic growth. This includes collaboration with the two other largest EU
economies, Germany and the UK. In March 2015, the German and French Economic Ministers
stated their intention to further integrate their digital economies,while the UK and France
109
launched a 2015 taskforce to investigate how they could use the ‘data revolution’ for mutual
economic benefit.The taskforce’s recommendationsincluded a passport programme for
110
startups, allowing companies to explore the digital business environment in both countries.

Furthermore, France released an International Digital Strategy in December 2017. Its purpose is to
develop the international competitiveness of the French digital sector, including an emphasis on
introducing French startups to external markets and drawing international digital talent to the
country. Historically France has been viewed as somewhat ‘clunky’ and anti-technology; something
President Macron is trying to address, including by capitalising on possible opportunities to lure
talent back to France following Brexit.He has alsooverseen the creation of a €10 billion fund for
111
startups, aimed at making France a ‘startup nation’.Additionally, Macron has recently stated that
112
Europe needs a big data strategy to compete with China and the US.
113
France is highly ranked in global measures of governments’ commitment to open data.It is placed
4th on the Global Open Data Index 2016/7,and 15thon the Digital Economy and Society Index
114
2017(just below the EU average). This reflects developments such as the government’s open
115
data portal, launched in 2011,France joining theOpen Government Partnership in 2014, and the
116
creation of a State Chief Data Officer. This was the first position of its kind in Europe.
117
Data legislation and regulation
Key legislation and regulation
France introduced the French Digital Republic Act on 7th October 2016, following a consultation
process that involved over 4,000 submissions from a range of sectors.The stated purpose of the
118
Act is as follows: firstly, to ensure France’s digital competitiveness by focusing on digital
infrastructure and data; secondly, to ensure users’ rights in the digital sphere and engage them
with France’s digital policy.
The Act itself has three key components:
●
It expands France’s open data policy and introduces the concept of ‘data of general
interest’;
●
It confirms the notions of network neutrality and data transferability, determines
individuals’ ‘digital rights’, and ensures that digital platforms treat consumers fairly;
●
It ensures universal internet access, with a focus on accessibility for disabled people
and connectivity for ‘the most disadvantaged members of society’.

The Digital Republic Act’s open data focus enshrines the principle of ‘open by default’, making it
the first country in Europe to put open data provisions in law.Amendments to Law No. 78-753
120
of July 1978, which enabled citizens to view public organizations’ administrative documents,
121
demand that such documents are now automatically made available online.The Act also ‘aims
122
to extend the scope of the administrative documents that may be already made available’.
Impact of GDPR and the European ePrivacy Regulation
The Digital Republic Act of 2016 prepares France for the introduction of GDPR in May 2018. In
particular, it provides individuals with the right to determine how their personal data is used.
123
The Act introduced amendments to Act no.78-17 of January 6 1978 on Data Processing Data Files
and Civil Liberties, also known as the French Data Protection Act. For example, it allows individuals
to state how their data be used after death, and to demand the deletion of personal data collected
on them as children.
124
While it outlines the French Data Protection Authority’s ability to impose upon companies four
percent of their global annual revenue for violations of GDPR Article 83, the Digital Republic Act
also enables regulators to fine companies up to €3 million for violations of the Data Protection Act
not covered by GDPR. This is an increase on the maximum €150,000 fines allowed by the original
Data Protection Act.
An additional draft law aimed at further amending the French Data Protection Act to bring it in line
with GDPR is being swiftly brought through Parliament in order to ensure its implementation by 25
May 2018.Among other changes, this will introducea right for individuals to access and delete
125
personal data collected in relation to criminal issues.

High-level market analysis
Finance
France’s FinTech sector is growing rapidly, with $62.5 million invested in FinTech in 2014, rising to a
record $297.8m in 2017. The average size of FinTech deals is also growing: from around $3.3
million in 2014 to $7.3 million in 2017.Despitethis growth, the French market lags behind
127
leading European countries in terms of its consumers’ use of FinTech services. Where 42 percent
of consumers in the UK, 37 percent in Spain, and 35 percent in Germany reported having used

129
Nevertheless, this relatively low rate of adoption presents an opportunity for growth in French
FinTech startups. The largest FinTech deal in 2017 saw startup Younited Credit raise $47.8 million.
A crowdlending platform, YounitedCredit allows customers to borrow up to €40,000 without
involving a bank; the company has also started using artificial intelligence to determine potential
customers’ credit-worthiness.
130
Telecoms operator Orange’s recent move into mobile banking further demonstrates the potential
for consumer-facing FinTech in France. Orange Bank was launched in late 2017 with the aim of
gaining two million customers.All of its bankingservices take place via smartphone, putting
131
Orange Bank in competition with German startup N26. N26 had 100,000 customers in France in
October 2017 compared with Orange Bank’s projected 200,000 in January 2018.

With Brexit on the horizon, France is seeking to capitalise on the opportunity to draw UK FinTech
companies and talent to France. Digital Minister Axelle Lemaire laid out a number of reasons that
France might be an attractive new home to FinTech companies:
132
●
FinTech-friendly regulation: the country’s complex labour laws have been reformed
(however these still remain somewhat opaque);
●
Privileges for tech entrepreneurs: the ‘tech ticket’ programme includes a grant and
fast-track visa, and has already attracted 180 entrepreneurs;
●
Several incubators and financial services centres, including the Station F incubator and
financial firms hub Finance Innovation;
●
Tax regime: corporation tax is set to be cut from 33 percent to 28 percent (compared to 30
percent in Germany, 25 percent in the Netherlands and 29 percent in Belgium), as well as
tax cuts for companies employing people in France.
France also seems to be making strides in the field of cryptocurrencies. The French Minister of the
Economy Bruno Le Maire recently shared the country’s intentions to become the leading
jurisdiction for initial coin offering (which is how funds can be raised for cryptocurrencies).France
133
and Germany have also collaborated on joint proposals for regulating bitcoin, which they are to
present at the 2018 G20.
134
Transport
The beta version of France’s transport open data portal, transport.data.gouv.fr, launched in autumn
2017 and intended to contain a database for static data and a ‘directory of external APIs for
real-time data’.The Ministry of Transport hostedan open data ‘Barcamp’ in June 2017 which
135
allowed representatives of the transport industry and transport users to give feedback on the portal
ahead of its launch.
136
Consumer-facing transportation platforms have had a significant impact on the French economy. In
2016, a BCG study showed that transportation network companies such as Uber created six
percent of GDP growth in Paris and two percent nationally in the first half of 2016, while also
creating one out of four new jobs in Paris.In 2015,meanwhile, the French government launched
137
an Uber-style app, Le Taxi, that used geolocation data and an open API to allow taxi operators to

easily attract customers and compete with Uber.All data collected by the app is also made
138
openly available.
139
French companies have also taken a leading role in developing platforms for easier journeys.
BlaBlaCar, for example, was founded in 2006 and was valued at $1.6bn in 2015.It matches
140
drivers with spare seats to passengers in need of a ride and operates in 22 countries with around
30 million users. In France and other European countries,booking rides with BlaBlaCar is now
141
also possible via Google Maps.
142
Artificial intelligence
Following the introduction of the Digital Republic Act, France launched its national artificial
intelligence strategy, #FranceIA, in January 2017.This recommends creating a fund of up to €25
143
million for AI startups, and emphasises the importance of guaranteeing capital for businesses to
allow them to take risks.The Digital Republic Actalso mandated the National Commission for
144
Information Technology and Liberties to conduct a large-scale consultation on AI ethics.
145
The momentum behind France’s artificial intelligence industry increased in January 2018 when
Facebook announced its intention to expand its AI research centre in Paris by investing €10 million,
increase the number of AI scientists from 30 to 60 and fund 40 PhD candidates rather than 10.
146
The centre, launched in 2015, is Facebook’s first research facility outside the USA. In the same
month, software company SAP announced that it would spend more than €2 billion over five years
on innovations including machine learning. They also purchased Recast.AI, a Paris-based startup,
with the intention of introducing Recast.AI’s natural language processing capabilities to enhance
the SAP user experience.
147
Such decisions demonstrate France’s increasing international competitiveness in AI. French
President Emmanuel Macron has made clear that France thinks it can lure IT workers from London
after the United Kingdom leaves the European Union; under his Presidency, France has launched a
new tech visa programme and directed state money to startups.The President also announced

at the end of March 2018 that his government would invest €1.5 billion into AI research until the
end of his term in 2022, to help accelerate innovation.
149
France’s relationship with the UK in this sphere, however, is also characterised by collaboration. In
January 2018 the two countries announced their intention to host a digital conference focusing on
AI as well as ‘data, cyber security, digital government and digital skills’; in the same week, Imperial
College London and the French National Centre for Scientific Research began working more
closely together on AI-relevant subjects.
150
Healthcare
The 2016 Law for the Modernisation of the Health System introduced amendments to France’s
Data Protection Law to establish a process for acquiring personal healthcare data; it also provides
some limited means for private companies to access data.This law allowed for a new national
151
healthcare database which is projected to be ‘one of the biggest healthcare databases in the
world’.Anonymised data within the database willbe made fully open, while personal data will
152
only be made available to bodies following strict guidelines.The French government also
153
consulted extensively with the public on the opening up of healthcare data: workshops and an
online consultation gathered views to be presented at a conference in July 2016.
In late 2016, it was reported that four Parisian hospitals were trialling using big data and artificial
intelligence to predict the flow of admissions and allocate resources accordingly, using an open
source platform that could be accessed by hospital staff.
154
Energy and utilities
Access to data on energy use is increasingly important to French public bodies seeking to save
money and use resources efficiently. The Energy Transition for Green Growth Act of 2016
contained a section enabling public bodies to access data held by energy providers where it
related to their operations.Equally, the FrenchChief Data Officer has worked with the national
155
procurement department and Ministry of Justice to understand how energy is being used in public
buildings and inform ‘the liberalisation of the electricity market’. This has resulted in ‘millions of
euros’ in procurement savings.

Other energy companies and operators publish energy-related data, including RTE and
Enedis/EDF, while many energy datasets are accessible via data.gouv.fr. These include information
about energy use in food production and energy data provided by regional institutions.

In the private sector, meanwhile, electricity company ENGIE has opened data for the La Haute
Borne wind farm.The purpose was to demonstrate theworkings of ENGIE’s Darwin big data

coalition agreementaffirms the government’s commitmentto open data and outlines plans to
166
develop an ‘ambitious, broad agenda’ for digitising public services. In support of this promise, a
2017 amendment to the General Administrative Law Act stated that all citizens and businesses
have the right to conduct all of their affairs with the government digitally. The government has also
created a connected system of 13 key databases that all of government uses frequently, which
serves as the backbone to other data efforts. Where possible this information is also published as
open data, such as the vehicle register, cadastral maps, addresses, and buildings.
167
The government is to come out with a new digital strategy later this year, which is likely to contain a
substantial section on the value of big data and potentially a new regulative model for data sharing.
A new Open Government Action Plan is also set tobe launched this spring, featuring nine action
168
topics, one of which is to be open algorithms and the principle of open by design for government
agencies.The Secretary-General at the Dutch EconomicAffairs Ministry Maarten Camps
169
announced at the start of 2018 that all companies, including data-rich businesses such as Google,
Facebook and Apple should share anonymous user data as part of a new model for economic
regulation. Camps said that this data was extremely valuable for businesses and improving
services, and failure to share it inhibits competition and allows for monopolies. New plans for data
sharing would still need to protect personal privacy, and companies may receive financial
compensation for data.

The country’s current digital strategy document (dated 2016)recognises data as one of their
170
main ‘challenges’. Key issues for data include:
●
The declining price of sensors, data storage and processing capacity. This leads to
increasing amounts of data online, and intensifies pressure on the capacity of digital
infrastructure;
●
Privacy and cybersecurity, and the following questions:
○
What data is collected?
○
On what legal basis is it collected?
○
Who can access the data?
○
What is done with it?
The strategy paper recognises that data privacy and cybersecurity represents an opportunity as
well as a challenge:
171
‘the guarantee of security and privacy is an important condition for purchasing products
and services. By ensuring these preconditions are met and by offering innovative products
and services in the field of cybersecurity, the Dutch business sector can stand out from its
competitors throughout the rest of the world’.
Ongoing governmental actions outlined in the Digital Strategy in relation to data include:
●
Schemes to train big data scientists in-country, as 300 more are needed every year;
●
New public-private partnerships (PPPs) in four sectors: energy, healthcare, cybersecurity
and industry. These have been initiated by Team ICT, the government body for digitisation.
In 2016-17 they sought to apply big data analysis to find solutions to social issues, such as
smart networks for energy, and diagnostics and prevention in healthcare;
●
Giving €50 million per year to fiscal measures for startups and SMEs.
The Dutch government has also created Commit2Data. This is a multi-year national research and
innovation programme aimed at developing the collection and use of data as a basis for economic
growth.This project is made up of Big Data Hubs,which focus on individual sectors, to try to
172
establish connections with economic clusters and regional field labs through PPPs. The hubs are a
pre-competitive environment where researchers, SMEs and large companies collaborate on
short-cycle real use cases.
Largely due to the country’s liberal corporate taxation laws, there is substantial foreign direct
investment in the ICT sector in the Netherlands, particularly focused in Amsterdam. Several major
players have chosen to situate their European headquarters here, including Facebook, Netflix and
Uber. Google and Microsoft also both have their European data centres in the Netherlands.

The country is also home to a number of smart cities including Eindhoven and Utrecht, where tech
is being used to tackle issues such as traffic, noise and crime.This includes amassing
173
substantial data using means such as wifi trackers, cameras and microphones on lamp posts. This
creates issues around personal privacy, particularly given that, in Utrecht (and other cities), a
significant number of smart projects are outsourced to private companies. CityTec, for example,
who manage car parks, traffic lights and lamp posts, have previously refused to share their data
with municipalities. In Amsterdam, these efforts tend to be based on a model of data sharing,
rather than open data, which would provide a more level playing field. Indeed, Amsterdam seems
to have more or less dropped ‘open data’ from their discourse.Some of these issues are a
174
product of local governments failing to draw up a clear agenda or set of procedures for the
contracts needed for these projects, resulting in data monopolies for specific companies. To help
address this, Geonovum (an association of geodata users including governments) have released a
toolto help local governments define their differentroles as regulators, guardians of public
175
spaces, data users, and providers of public environments as innovations platforms.
176
Data legislation and regulation
Key legislation and regulation
The Dutch Personal Data Protection Act has been in place since 1 January 2016, and sets out the
main laws for handling personal data.The Dutch DataProtection Authority supervises the law’s
177
implementation. The law stipulates that people should be informed in advance of data collection,
and the purpose specified. In reality, this has not been uniformly implemented, as evidenced by
Guardianresearch into smart cities where vast quantitiesof data is collected on individuals without
their knowledge or explicit consent.
178
The government has recently increased penalties for noncompliance with personal data privacy
laws. The Data Breach (Notification Obligation) Act (Meldplicht Datalekken) and the extension of the
power to impose fines (as set under the Dutch Data Protection Act) came into force in January
2016, in anticipation of similar obligations under GDPR.
The duty of notification means that if a breach of security measures around personal data is
discovered, the data controller must immediately report it to the Dutch Data Protection Authority.
The data controller then has to report this information to affected individuals if their personal privacy
is under threat. The maximum fine for non-compliance with the Act was also raised from €4,500 to

€810,000; or 10 percent of the annual net turnover of a company, per violation.This obligation
179
will continue on top of GDPR. The Data Protection Law has already been used to investigate major
companies such as Microsoftand Airbnb.As GDPRapproaches, the number of data leaks
180181
reported to the Data Protection Authority has greatly increased: in 2017, 10,000 were reported, up
by 70% from 2016, which the authority interprets as a growth in public awareness.
182
Impact of GDPR and the European ePrivacy Regulation
The Netherlands are viewed by many other European countries as an interesting test case for the
impacts of GDPR. This is due to the number of tech giants headquartered there who rely on
customer data.The country already has a good trackrecord of creating national data protection
183
laws (see previous section on key regulation). This means that implementing GDPR will, in theory,
not be unchartered territory. On 13 December 2017 the Dutch government sent their GDPR
Implementation Bill (theAlgemene Verordening Gegevensbescherming,or AVG) to Parliament. The
bill is designed to ensure that GDPR is implemented in a ‘policy-neutral manner’; i.e. that all
existing legislation continues so long as it is permitted under GDPR.
184
The Personal Data Protection Data Act, which is to be replaced by GDPR, has broadly similar
principles governing the use of personal data (lawfulness, fairness, transparency and accuracy),
and generally similar obligations.Key differences,common to most countries subject to GDPR,
185
include changes for those who process personal data on a daily basis. For example, human
resources departments will now have to comply with new employee rights such as the right to be
forgotten and the right to data portability.
There is a lack of clarity over who will be responsible for overseeing ePrivacy laws. The European
Parliament and EU would like this to be overseen by the Data Protection Authority, but ePrivacy is
currently overseen by the Consumer and Market Authority (ACM).The Minister of Justice and
186
Security Sander Dekker issued a memorandum in December stating that it would be up to the
respective bodies to handle the overlap in duties on a case-by-case basis.

PwC’s June 2017 reportPrivacy Governancereviewed 350 companies in the Netherlands and
188
found that only around 12 percent were suitably prepared for the implementation of AVG. A large
proportion of companies lacked rules to comply with the January 2016 national Data Breach Act. A
later report from November 2017 still found that 80 percent of companies were not compliant with
the new law.This lack of preparedness for GDPR hasled to a rise in companies helping to assist

High-level market analysis
Finance
The Dutch FinTech environment is growing quickly, reflecting the country’s projected image as a
digital innovation hub. There are approximately 430 companies currently active in the Dutch
FinTech market, and this number grew by 100 over the last year alone.The government is
191
supporting this growth. The 2017 coalition agreement states that it will establish a Dutch finance
and development institution, InvestNL, and make €2.5 billion available in the budget for it.
192
This is intended to encourage investments in sectors where the country has not yet capitalised on
all opportunities. The body is to act as a single point of contact for entrepreneurs seeking risk
capital, guarantees, export credit insurance and international finance programmes. It will also help
develop and invest in major public projects in the country and overseas, and support innovative
businesses such as start-ups and scale-ups. In particular, InvestNL will focus on “high-risk
activities within various transition areas” such as energy, mobility, and the digitisation of industry.
The coalition agreement also explicitly recognises the value of innovative financial technology
(FinTech), stating that in order to encourage these companies to grow, the government will
introduce less strict licensing requirements for banking and other services. Meanwhile,
Commit2Data has run a programme to fund research into big data applications for banking and
insurance. Major banks are collaborating with FinTechs, as well as offering their own FinTech
initiatives such as PEAKS (Rabobank), Gappie (Nationale Nederlanden) and Kandoor (APG).
Europe’s largest FinTech event, Money 20/20, is to be held in Amsterdam this year.
However, according to the 2017 EY FinTech Adoption Index, only 27 percent of the digitally active
population use FinTech services, which is below the EU average of 33 percent. Also, FinTech
growth has not been without controversy. Dutch banking giant ING came under fire in 2014 when it
announced a plan to sell its customers’ payment data to other companies, to enable them to target
advertising. Substantial negative backlash forced the bank to renege on its on plans, and the

Transport
The 2017 coalition agreement stresses the need to take autonomous vehicles into account when
designing infrastructure. It also states that, “wherever possible, government information on traffic
and transport for vehicles, apps and journey and route planners will be provided as open data”.
196
To govern this, the agreement pledges to create rules on ownership and use of travel data. In
2017, a national agreement was signed between the Ministry of Transport, public transport
concession holders, Translink Systems (who operate radio frequency identification travel cards),
and the Provinces (who provide concessions for regional public transport), to make full trip data
(including multimodal single trips, e.g. from train to bus to tram) available. The agreement was

designed to mitigate the associated privacy issues whilst making this valuable data available for

The Digital Strategy also discusses the importance of big data for mobility in the Netherlands. A
large part of this is provided by the national data warehouse for traffic data (NDW), which published
real time sensor data on traffic density, number of vehicles and speed, and the national department
for traffic (RDW), which publishes technical data and license plates.The strategy outlines
198
research into a new system for regulating the taxi market as part of a ‘future-proof legislation’
approach to quickly remove impediments to innovation. It also discusses government collaboration
with research and academic institutes and the business sectors on programmes such as:
●
The Better Use (Beter Benutten) [of existing travelinfrastructure] programme. This is to
provide €1.1 billion of public funding for 250 measures across ten regions, and includes
improving real-time travel data to help reduce traffic jams;
199
●
The Declaration of Amsterdam on connected and automated driving. This is an agreement
between the European Commission and the private sector on joint goals and actions for
introducing automated cars to Europe’s roads;
200
●
The European Truck Platooning Challenge, organised by the Netherlands to promote
convoys of semi-automated trucks across Europe.
201
The Digital Strategy also discusses the need to change the way that data is shared in the mobility
and logistics sector, with an emphasis on standardisation. The government is developing a single
portal for trade and transport to optimise this.
In the private sector, Uber’s European headquarters is based in Amsterdam. They plan to double
the number of staff members working there to 1,000 over the next decade. The company
processes revenue from rides elsewhere in Europe in the Netherlands, due to lower corporate tax
rates (25 percent, compared to 33 percent in France, 30 percent in Germany and 29 percent in
Belgium). This has attracted substantial criticism from the London Private Hire Car Association,
who called it ‘tax avoidance on an industrial scale’.The company has previously run into trouble
202
with Dutch regulators, who twice raided the offices in 2015 over the low-cost UberPOP service,
which they suspected of operating without sufficient licensing. This service was discontinued in the
same year.

Artificial intelligence
According to Asgard research, Amsterdam is the sixth biggest AI hub (in terms of number of AI
companies) in Europe, after London, Berlin, Paris, Madrid and Stockholm. The city recently
launched a new AI training programme called Artificial Intelligence for Growth to teach people from
non-technical backgrounds about AI.The programmeis run by the Growth Tribe Academy, with
205
partners including Startup Amsterdam, Microsoft and the Dataiku data science platform. There is
significant multidisciplinary collaboration in Amsterdam between academia and industry, with labs
such as Qualcomm-QUVA Lab (researching deep vision), UvA-Bosch DELTA Lab (researching
applications of deep learning to automotive and computer vision), AMLAB (for machine learning),
Intelligent Sensory Information Systems (for computer vision) and ILPS (for information retrieval).
Many of these are based at the Amsterdam Science Park, which is a key site for dialogue and
shared research between science and industry.
206
The city, which received the 2016 European Capital of Innovation Award,also hosted the World
207
Summit for AI, the world’s biggest applied AI conference, in October 2017. Europe’s first AI
accelerator, Rockstart, was launched in 2017 in the city, initially to fund ten startups.The city’s
208
two major universities also have joint AI masters programmes to help grow local talent. Some
notable local AI companies are Sightcorp,who helpedpioneer real-time measurement of facial
209

210211
data problems.
Healthcare
The Digital Strategy recognises the digitisation of healthcare as a major priority area, and notes the
role of big data in helping to diagnose diseases such as Parkinsons and Alzheimers. Big data can
also allow for greater transparency in the sector, as the paper states: “[d]igital operations and
standardised data exchange boost the healthcare sector and must therefore become the
standard”.
212
The 2017 coalition agreement pledges to set aside a total of €40 million for the administration’s
term in office, and €5 million a year thereafter, for promoting digitally assisted care delivery and

more widespread use of innovative working methods.Key government goals for eHealth include:
213
214
●
Access to medical records - by 2019, 80 percent of the chronically ill population and 40
percent of the general population should have direct access to their own medical records
(note that a 2011 government initiative for a national centralised system for patient files
failed, and since then there has been an opt-in ‘national switchboard’ where data is shared
by care providers with a patient’s consent - although patients do not know what specifically
is shared or who can access it);
215
●
Health monitoring - by 2019, 75 percent of chronically ill and elderly people should be able
to monitor their own healthcare data and share this with their health provider;
●
Online contact with care provider - those receiving care and support at home should be
able to communicate with their provider at any time via a screen.
While an ongoing healthcare modernisation programme exists (Innovatie en Zorgvernieuwing),the
Digital Strategy states that large-scale applications of eHealth initiatives are often lacking. This is
due in part to a lack of resources for highly reliable verification of users and standards for logging
on to systems. Steps taken so far have included:
216
●
The first ‘Health Deal’ was signed in 2016 by a combination of public and private
companies in the IT and healthcare sectors to try to scale up innovations in healthcare;
●
The government has set up an online support platformfor healthcare innovators,
217
including funding tips;
●
Making digital data-sharing easier - the government is consulting healthcare administrators
on standards to facilitate data sharing, and talking to IT suppliers;
●
Bringing together healthcare innovators and other parties to share knowledge and help
advance innovations;
●
Overseeing collaboration between various parties in the healthcare sector on a programme
to agree standards and requirements for personal digital healthcare environments.
Health Valley is a unifying network to encourage and support technological innovations in
healthcare. It is a public-private partnership funded by contributions from the government and
partners from the network. It provides a platform to connect universities, care institutions,
companies and government authorities to exchange information and work on innovations in
healthcare.
It is important to note, however, that despite all the government rhetoric around eHealth initiatives,
the basic data and operations of the healthcare system remain very opaque.There is generally
218
no available data on, for example, the costs of treatments and the quality of care providers. Even

the Ministry of Health only receives healthcare data after a three year lag. The public national care
authority (NZA) dropped ‘providing transparency of costs’ as one of its stated goals after receiving
a freedom of information request for this data, which they successfully fought in the highest court.
Insurers and care providers have, however, been fighting for greater transparency. Furthermore, in
2015 the financial responsibility for youth care, chronic care provision and care for the elderly was
devolved to local governments, which has led to a fragmentation of data and policy.
219
Energy and utilities
Since the Energy Agreement for Sustainable Growth (2013),the Netherlands has been pursuing
220
a transition away from non-renewables, aided by IT. The Digital Agenda emphasises energy and
utilities, and focuses on the development of smart networks and smart grids. Key ideas in the
document for applications of big data in energy include:
221
●
Maps to display energy consumptions of regions, districts and buildings to help manage
the infrastructure, develop spatial policy, and offer energy conservation products and
services;
●
Improving weather forecasts using data from windmills and solar panels;
●
Linking data from generators and consumers of energy through digital platforms.
The national transition away from non-renewables (to be completed by 2050) remains a major
focus point of the Coalition Agreement and substantial government funds (around €4 billion a year)
are allocated to the various associated budget items, with an additional set of funding for
innovation policy.
Commit2Data are researching how big data can assist this transition. They are seeking to achieve
change in this domain through the use of PPPs, with projects starting in this sphere in early 2018.
Big data is recognised as a key enabler in coordinatingthe transition through smart meters and
222
sensors. Through Commit2Data, the Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO)
awarded grants worth €3.85 million to six projects, to be combined with private sector funding,
including ‘intranets for energy’ and ‘peer-to-peer energy grids’.
223
Energy transporters (publicly owned private entities) already provide both open and shared data,
but also turn down lots of data requests. Although they see the value of releasing data, for example
to aid the energy transition, they are often forced to turn down requests for a number of reasons.
These include privacy concerns (around data such as that from smart metres) and contractual
confusion due to their position in charge of a data pool derived from both public, private, and
individual sources who submit data under varying conditions.

Belgium
Mapping the data economy
Belgium is the 9th largest economy in the EU and 25th in the world.With a growth rate of 1.6
225
percent in 2017, its economy is described as ‘well-diversified’, ranging from manufacturing to
services and technology, and based on extensive transport infrastructure.Belgium has a large
226
tech industry in relation to its small population of 11 million citizens: it has 22 companies in
Deloitte's Fast 500 list for 2016.
227
Belgium is ranked 22nd in the global Open Data Indexand 6th out of 28 EU countries in the
228
2016 Digital Economy and Society Index (DESI). It therefore forms part of a cluster of
high-performing countries when measured on its digital infrastructure, confidence and security,
skills and jobs, economy, and government.
229
However, Belgium’s DESI ranking of 6th in 2016 represents a fall from its 5th place in 2015.
Equally, the 2016 BCG e-Intensity Index, which measures the extent to which a country embraces
the internet, ranks Belgium 19 out of 85 countries. It therefore sits behind many of its European
peers. Belgium also ranked 17th in European countries on the 2017 Global Innovation Index,
behind comparable nations such as Sweden (2nd), the Netherlands (3rd), and Denmark (6th).
230
These rankings suggest that Belgium risks being out-performed by its European neighbours, yet
also possesses a well-developed baseline and potential for significant growth in its digital economy.
Indeed, it is estimated that a fully operational digital market embracing digital technology and
startups in Belgium could double the GDP growth rate by 2020. Potentially, this could translate into
300,000 full-time jobs across the digital sector and wider economy.
231
Belgium possesses one of the most devolved government structures in the world, and both its
federal and regional governments have recently sought to end any apparent digital complacency.
At present, the country has ‘crossroads’ databases at both the federal and regional level, where
multiple government stakeholders pool data. In a similar model to the Netherlands (and Denmark),
some of these datasets are open. However in Belgium (unlike the Netherlands and Denmark),

largely due to complicated government structures, these ‘crossroads’ databases are not
connected in a single unified system.
232
In 2015, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for the Digital Agenda Alexander de Croo launched
new federal open data strategy, Digital Belgium. This is a five point plan to put Belgium ‘firmly on
the digital map’. At its centre is a commitment to transition all government data to ‘digital by
default’, available for use by non-profit and commercial applications without attribution.Aiming to
233
create 1,000 new startups and 50,000 jobs, and grant internet users access to 1Gbps connectivity
by 2020, this agenda contains an explicit commitment to place Belgium 3rd in the DESI by 2020. It
has received strong support from organisations such as Open Knowledge Belgium.
234
These ambitious agendas are currently at the early stages of enactment, meaning that Belgium is
yet to realise their full potential. Nevertheless, the government’s actions are promising. There is a
clear recognition that new companies and organisations will shape Belgium’s new digital economy
meaning, and this creates a window of opportunity for young and emerging actors. This is
particularly so in FinTech. Following Britain’s decision to leave the European Union, Belgian Finance
Minister Johan van Overtveldt has sought to build new links between the two countries with the
launch of a new Brussels-based hub to support financial technology startups.
235
Data legislation and regulation
Key legislation and regulation
The 2015 Digital Belgium strategy is the centerpiece driving the federal government’s digital policy
agenda. Not only does it make all government data sets open-by-default when requested, but it is
required for the data to be published in easy-to-access, and machine-readable formats (useful for
researchers and app developers alike). It is the government’s intention that by 2020, all government
data will be proactively published without requiring citation through the use of CC0 (licenses
without restriction - often the best form of open data licenses).To make this happen, every
236
government department must develop an open data strategy that includes appointing a
responsible Open Data Champion to put the initiative into practice. This is overseen by the creation
in 2016 of the Digital Transformation Office - a centre of excellence and innovation in the
intersection of new technologies and data.The federalgovernment also launched a new
237
government cloud (“G-Cloud”) providing a single platform for the integration of federal services and
ministries. The strategy represents a clear embrace of digital governance where exceptions for
privacy and security - rather than openness - have to be justified. Privacy is still taken seriously (as

the GDPR section will illustrate), with the strategy ensuring that all personal information is
anonymised, with an open data committee within the Privacy Commission overseeing this.
238
The federal government’s strategy is rightly ambitious, aiming to place it 3rd in the DESI rankings by
2020 with a five-point plan closely aligned to the key measures behind the index.Beyond open
239
data, the strategy contains commitments to improve digital infrastructure (1 Gbps fibre broadband
by 2020), ease of doing business (electronic invoicing is now an obligation for all government
suppliers), and simplifying regulation for startups. Recognising that more and more people provide
services to others as ‘mini-entrepreneurs’ through apps and other digital platforms (in what is
known as the collaborative economy), the federal government introduced a new innovative legal
framework in 2017 clarifying and streamlining taxes for these services. Under an income of €5,000,
such services will be taxed at a straightforward, reduced rate of 10 percent (deducted at source) to
prevent fraud and unfair competition with other small businesses - a vast improvement on the
previous 33 percent rate that was applied ad hoc and required individuals to self-report income to
tax authorities.This is complemented by the doublingof investments in startups each year since
240
2015, with Belgium having long lagged behind its European peers in startup funding.
241
BCG highlights that this has amounted to a significant increase in regulation in recent years,
particularly in terms of fiscal and social legislation for the sharing economy. However, there are still
important focus areas for improvement. Europe’s 2017 Digital Progress Report for Belgium
highlights that 68 percent of Belgians reported having at least basic digital skills (the EU average is
56 percent), and though there is high enrollment in tertiary education, there is a distinct shortage in
graduates of STEM subjects necessary for growth and innovation, particularly in digital technology.
The BCG report highlights this and labour market flexibility as key weaknesses of the government’s
approach thus far.Despite these shortcomings, thegovernment has launched a Digital
242
Champions scheme (‘to make every child in Belgium a digital champion’),and plan to bring IT
243
professionals into schools. Perhaps the most significant move by the government is the
announcement of an €18 million digital skills fund to advance coding and digital skills training
courses for young people over the next three years.
244
The legislative situation in Belgium is complicated by its heavily devolved governance between the
Flemish, Walloon, and Brussels regional parliaments and executives. Indeed, Open Knowledge
Belgium has claimed that this results in Belgium’s digital performance being understated in several
international indices such as the EU Digital Economy and Society Index which is based primarily on
federal-level measures.What is happening at theregional legislative level is therefore highly

consequential and should not be ignored. Flanders thus far has been at the forefront of open data
in Belgium with open standards set for its regional government as early as 2014. Numerous events
and initiatives such as hackathons are well established across Flemish cities and supported by the
Flemish Open Data Forum.There is now also a SmartCities Flanders program, which is a broad
246
stakeholder network with Flemish government and EU funding.Likewise, Wallonia has sought to
247
catch up by launching Digital Wallonia, a platform for IT initiatives which provides an open data
portal for the region as a whole.Key to these regionalinitiatives is the idea of not only improving
248
citizens’ lives, but ensuring data is readily available for research purposes, a key principle behind
the opening up of datasets on Brussel’s new City Portal.
249
Finally, Belgium is in the process of radically reforming its Data Protection Agency by investing an
extra €150 million euros into its annual budget. The goal is to ensure ‘state of the art standards’
that treat GDPR as a ‘business opportunity’.
250251
Impact of GDPR and the European ePrivacy Regulation
Ensuring both public and private organisations are ready for the GDPR is being taken extremely
seriously by both federal and regional governments with practical advice to firms issued by the
national Privacy Commission (in the form of a 13 step plan)and through Digital Wallonia.The
252253
GDPR has prompted the federal government to radically overhaul its Data Protection Authority, with
the national Parliament approving an extra €1.7 million for its annual budget to secure a ‘state of
the art’ agency to operate on a par with the biggest data protection authorities around the world.
254
The outgoing President of the Belgian Commission for the Protection of Privacy, Willem
Debeuckelaere, is frank in stating that despite significant investment and efforts, “[e]ven the Belgian
DPA will not be 100 percent compliant with the GDPR on May 25...[but] don’t worry, we won’t be
the only ones”.
255
Belgium’s Secretary of State for Privacy, Philippe De Backer, views this as a ‘business opportunity’
to create a level playing field between the public and private sectors to enable data exchange.
256
He emphasises that the new Data Protection Agency’s approach, (when it comes online in May
2018) is not simply to sanction, but ‘provide guidelines for businesses and create legal certainty’.
As part of this, sanctioning mechanisms have been written into law to avoid ambiguity and in

transposing EU legislation to national law, they also seek to make exceptions for archiving statistics

257
High-level market analysis
Finance
Belgium is being touted as a surprisingly good platform for FinTech startup and development,
despite its present low adoption rate of 13 percent amongst consumers (below a global average of
33 percent).Though an early pioneer in the standardisationof payments between banks,
258
Belgium’s small market and population size, alongside a comparative decline in startup investment
have not made Belgium an obvious choice for FinTech innovation recently. However, this has the
potential to rapidly change over the next few years. The industry’s roots in payments systems gives
Belgium a clear potential focus area within the sector, with one survey showing that almost all
FinTech usage in Belgium originates from digital payments, facilitated by the rise of e-commerce in
the last decade.
259
Generally, Belgium is unusual in that three quarters of its startups are business-to-business
focused, a trend very much in evidence in its FinTech firms with companies like Xpenditure offering
services for businesses over consumers and Clear2Pay focusing on helping financial institutions to
improve internal payments processes. Belgium has long been at the forefront of applying innovative
technologies in the financial system, with firms such as Clear2Pay having raised $127 million over
its 16-year lifetime.
260
Despite Belgium hosting big players in FinTech, investments tend to be concentrated in early-stage
startups, with more than 60 percent of the country’s 56 funding rounds awarded for less than €5
million in 2016. Not only is startup funding increasing, but the government launched a ‘Startup Plan
2015’ to create a tax shelter for tech companies, reducing tax bills by anywhere from 30-45
percent.Though Belgium’s small market means FinTechfirms have to build an outward-facing
261
business, the country’s comparatively developed market makes it an ideal innovation base prior to
rolling out products to wider markets. This is being reinforced by the Finance Minister Johan van
Overtveldt’s approach to Brexit, in which he has deliberately sought to build mutually beneficial
bridges with UK FinTech firms to continue to keep international markets open for Belgian firms that
rely on them.

Transport
Belgium has one of the most developed transport networks in the world, which is also highly
integrated into the European transport system. The European project ‘Open Transport Net’,
launched in 2014, includes two hub cities in Belgium - Antwerp and Ghent. The project’s aim is to
create virtual hubs aggregating, harmonising, and visualising transport-related data to make it
easier for innovators to create new services and opportunities.In 2013, Brussels Mobility and the
263
Brussels Regional Informatics Centre jointly designed an Open Data license that currently only
applies only to their own data sets and specifically to the Brussels UrbIS geodata. It is this
intelligent data-lead approach to managing transport data and communicating it to relevant
stakeholders that is gaining an increased foothold, though at the moment still lags behind nearby
large cities such as London, Paris and Amsterdam.
Belgium, like Germany, France, and the Netherlands, is a beneficiary of the C-Roads project
supported by a combined €55 million grant from the EU, to implement technologies that enable
vehicles to ‘talk’ to each other in moving towards a smart road network.External organisations
264
such as ITS.be (Intelligent Transport Systems), a public-private not-for-profit, have conducted
extensive lobbying of federal and regional governments seeking to accelerate the transition to
sustainable mobility across the country.
265
Artificial intelligence
Brussels has new ambitions to be a centre for AI research and innovation.Recently, Innoviris
266
(Brussels Institute for Scientific Research) unveiled an investment programme, Team UP, of €4
million, to support companies and higher education in developing solutions for image analysis,
telemedicine, virtual reality, robotics, and financial analysis.One such beneficiary, ChatBot Plus,
267
is already helping improve customer service using chatbot technology via Facebook.These
268
developments present powerful opportunities for the application of AI in the Belgian retail industry.
As a recent PWC report on the applicability of automation in the Belgian retail sector points out, AI
could be used at almost every stage of retail from checkouts, sales forecasting, and in-store
analysis, accompanied by robotic process automation (RPA) which can be used to carry out
high-level repetitive tasks behind the scenes including populating tax returns with financial data,
and automated invoicing.Though the Belgian retailsector needs to invest in business software
269
and structured, centralised databases to realise this potential, these automatic processes represent
opportunities applicable to the wider Belgian economy (beyond retail).

According to ‘The State of European Tech’ report 2016, Brussels and Antwerp are in the top 15
hubs of artificial intelligence talent in Europe (12th and 14th respectively).Likewise, KU Leuven
270
and Ghent University are ranked in the top 100 worldwide by most-cited AI related research.
271
Though there are plenty of green shoots in regards to AI development in Belgium, there are
currently no political frameworks to systematically advance, implement or discuss issues
surrounding AI at the federal or regional level, and the issue is yet to reach the stage of salient
national debate.

a three-tier regulatory framework to ensure the responsible growth of this exciting sector which
deals with sensitive information:
274
●
Tier 1 - minimum privacy, security, and purpose requirements every app should satisfy;
●
Tier 2 - ensure the interoperability of medical apps with official e-health applications;
●
Tier 3 - funding to reimburse apps generating added value to the health economy.
Launched in 2015, Recip-e, a "non-addressed" prescription messaging service (the prescriber
does not know which provider the patient will turn to, when the prescription is produced), is a
prime example of an expanding e-health domain.Sinceroll-out, 90 percent of generalists in
275
Belgian healthcare are equipped with Recip-e.
276
Appropriate regulation of the e-health sector in Belgium is set to be addressed as Maggie De
Block, alongside Alexander De Croo (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister responsible for the Digital
Agenda) plan to create a ‘Digital Health Valley’.The plans to develop an ecosystem of firms
277
involved in all aspects of the e-health economy have already served as a platform for the launch of
HealthTech.Belgium, a collaborative effort bringing together key actors in the sector to make
Belgium the world’s starting base for innovation in health technologies.Grassroots innovation in
278
Belgium appears to have prompted a government vision and support which lays promising ground
for the growth of its e-health economy.
Energy and utilities
The energy market is currently in the process of remarkable change in Belgium. A new federal
clearing house (ATRIAS) and the implementation of a new energy market process model, MIG6.0,
will greatly simplify the data exchange between energy market stakeholders in a liberalised market,
and incorporate the latest technologies (such as smart meters and decentralised energy
production) respectively.With technology enablingthe production and use of data in a liberalised
279
energy market with decentralised producers, the Belgian energy market was in need of a simplified,
transparent, and efficient model to handle increasing data and exchange. Crucial to this is the
creation of a federal, standardised, central communication platform to simplify information
exchange between market players.
There is much pressure across Europe to adopt new market practices and restructure energy data
management with the mass roll-out of smart-meters (up to 80 percent coverage by 2020)
increasing the amount and frequency of energy data. This new data also brings with it the need to
properly legislate protections of customer data. Belgium’s energy market also faces long-term

Appendix 1: methodology
We conducted desk-based research over a period of six weeks, to map out the data economies of
Germany, the Netherlands, France and Belgium. We consulted a wide range of online resources,
from public sector documents and policy statements to reports produced by private companies
and consultancy firms. Given time and resource constraints, we have attempted to summarise as
much salient information as possible for each country from the wide potential range of information
and resources to consider. It is important to note, therefore, that that this work is non-exhaustive
and may contain omissions.
