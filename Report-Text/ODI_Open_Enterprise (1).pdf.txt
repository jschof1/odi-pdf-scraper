Executive summary
As  businesses  get  bigger,  staying  innovative  and  agile  is  challenging.  This  report  explores  
three industry-leading enterprises that have embraced an open approach – open source, open 
standards, open data, open innovation – to help retain their competitive edge. 
“We’re becoming an open platform for our customers, a core piece of their operating 
infrastructure.”
– Tim Baker, Global Head of Content Strategy and Innovation, Thomson Reuters
The three multinationals featured in this report are proving that ‘being open’ is about more than 
just taking advantage of data made open by governments, other businesses and community 
groups. These companies have adopted an open approach to keep pace with change, adapt 
to new markets and influence whole sectors. In effect, they are becoming porous – using an 
open approach as a mechanism to improve their services, take advantage of new ideas and 
opportunities, and grow and collaborate more with their networks.
Thomson Reuters, Arup and Syngenta are embedding open principles into their operations 
to  gain  competitive  advantage.  All  three  are  large-scale  consumers  of  data,  and  sell  data-
based products. Today, the market for data – data itself, data services and platforms, and data 
analytics – is hyper competitive. Big businesses in every sector are asking themselves how 
they can use data more effectively to improve their operations. For Thomson Reuters, Arup 
and Syngenta, being open has become crucial for overcoming the challenges that many big 
businesses face:
 reusing third-party sources of data to drive internal decision making and create 
new competitive products and services
 maintaining a leadership position in increasingly competitive markets
 keeping costs low for the business and for customers and partners they work with 
 staying agile and ready to evolve as the environment they operate in changes
 collaborating with clients, and even competitors, to tackle sector-wide challenges
Each of these businesses has addressed these kinds of challenges in a different way.
Thomson  Reuters  has  taken  what  started  as  an  internal  data  management  solution  and  
created a new, collaborative information platform providing open data that anyone can 
access,  use  and  share.  The  team  took  this  approach  to  improve  client  relationships,  the  
quality of their data and uptake of their existing products.

Arup  has  created  and  connected  with  an  ecosystem  of  open  innovators.  Backed  by  a  
compelling business model, the team is reducing transactional friction between their customers’ 
challenges  and  their  teams’  ability  to  address  them,  through  a  porous  data  supply-chain.   
This has led to new products and new ways of working, and saved them time and money.
Syngenta started off publishing open data to increase transparency but soon realised that 
it could help them shift to a more open, or networked, approach to operating. The team 
are determined to capitalise on the new relationships that this will create.
Each  has  used  an  open  approach  as  a  mechanism  to  retain  competitive  advantage. 
Whether by publishing open data or building an open ecosystem, they are developing trust, 
creating networks and nurturing fertile ground for future innovation.

Introduction
In  our  networked  economies,  taking  an  open  approach  has  become  key  to  maintaining  a  
competitive  advantage.
1
 The success of a company relies on having collaborative and fluid 
relationships with their partners, customers and even competitors. Whether it’s through open 
data,
2
 open source,
3
 open innovation,
4
 or a combination of them all, taking an open approach 
enables that collaboration.
In  early  2015  we  published  ‘Open  data  means  business,’  a  report  that  highlighted  270  
companies across the UK that used, produced or invested in open data – data that anyone can 
access, use and share.
5
 It showed that open data is being used to create innovative products 
and services in a number of different sectors, adding to the growing body of evidence that 
demonstrates the economic impact of open data.
6
Interestingly,  the  study  demonstrated  that  the  companies  making  use  of  open  data  are  not  
all trendy startups. Nearly 10% of the open data companies we identified had 251 or more 
employees.  We  wanted  to  investigate  how  and  why  these  organisations  were  working  with  
open  data.  Detailed  case  studies  of  three  big  businesses  –  Thomson  Reuters,  Arup  and 
Syngenta – form the majority of this report.

Embracing open innovation: what’s in it for big businesses?
It comes as no surprise that big businesses take advantage of open data from government 
and elsewhere. For commercial organisations, using open data provides additional insight at 
limited cost. Whether it’s to help choose where to put a new store, or to create an analytical 
product for customers, there are clear advantages for businesses to use whatever data they 
can find. There are clear parallels between the increasing use of open data and the growing 
adoption  of  open  source  software.  Both  provide  a  cost-effective  and  increasingly  trusted 
alternative to proprietary sources.
But nearly all businesses have treated the data they generate themselves as an asset to be 
closely guarded and released only to those prepared to pay for it, if at all. In some cases this 
careful handling is justified: for example, the sharing of personal data is limited by law. It’s 
only now that some of the UK’s market-leading enterprises are releasing their own open data. 
These companies have found that making some of their valuable data assets available – not 
just  at  no  cost,  but  with  permissive  licences  that  allow  the  data  to  be  accessed,  used  and  
shared by anyone – can reduce friction in trade with others, increase their market reach and 
build commercial resilience in the long-term.
Open  data  is  just  one  strand  of  a  more  open  approach  to  innovation.  As  they  seek  to  gain  
a competitive advantage, big businesses are trying to be faster-moving, more adaptive and 
more disruptive. They have adopted a more open approach to external ideas and technologies 
as well. They are becoming porous organisations.
By  examining  the  actions  and  motivations  of  Thomson  Reuters,  Arup  and  Syngenta  we 
have  found  these  three  large  businesses  are  seeking  competitive  advantage  in  a  changing  
environment through strategically adopting an open approach. Some make use of open data, 
some publish it, but for each it forms a significant part of their open approaches to innovation.

Case studies
Thomson Reuters’ data services go open
Thomson Reuters is a multinational organisation that provides  news  and  information  to  
industry  professionals.  The  company  offers  a  wide  range  of  services  –  primarily  around 
information and data – in areas including finance and risk, law, tax and accounting, intellectual 
property and science. Thomson Reuters reported $12.2bn in revenue in 2015.
7
Thomson Reuters was formed through Thomson Corporation’s merger with Reuters Group in 
2008 and has since continued to grow, in part through acquisition. But as with any company 
that  has  evolved  in  this  way,  there  can  be  challenges  in  integrating  legacy  data  resources  
and systems.
In order to tackle this challenge, Thomson Reuters took an innovative linked data approach 
which  allowed  it  to  join  up  its  specialised  data  assets  without  having  to  migrate  them  to  a  
single  database  or  data  warehouse.  It  began  by  establishing  central  data  ‘authorities’  to  
ensure  that  key  entity  data  (such  as  organisations  and  people)  was  only  mastered  once.  
Each of these entities was assigned a Permanent Identifier (PermID). Each PermID provided 
a unique reference point for a single entity – for example, Thomson Reuters Corp itself has a 
PermID of 4295861160. The concept of permanence meant the PermID, and its relationship 
to a specific entity, would not change over time. Existing databases were “re-mastered” by 
adding PermIDs alongside legacy identifiers, with a view to ultimately replace them altogether. 
PermIDs were also used to uniquely identify other information objects such as news articles, 
deals and corporate actions.
Demand for the PermID approach
Thomson  Reuters  is  no  stranger  to  helping  its  customers  with  their  data  management 
challenges, having managed the RIC system for financial instrument identification for many 
years. The team therefore recognised that the work they were doing internally with PermID had 
broader applications. Not only were new internal products and services created, but Thomson 
Reuters was approached directly by clients who used its products and wanted to integrate 
them with their own data.

8 Open enterprise: how three big businesses create value with open innovation | Open Data Institute 2016
Like Thomson Reuters, these clients wanted to join up their own data holdings for internal use 
and provide consistent and interoperable data products and services to their clients. As Wilbur 
Swan, Head of Enterprise Metadata Services, puts it, data siloing issues were not unique to 
Thomson Reuters, but “a problem shared by all our clients”.
Thomson  Reuters  “knew  [it]  had  in  PermID  a  solution  to  wider  industry  problems”,  says 
Tim Baker, Global Head of Content Strategy and Innovation. And as Dan Bennett, Head of 
Enterprise Data Services, explains:
“We  believe  that  this  is  the  right  thing  for  our  customers  because  our  customers  are  
asking for it. And, in a very broad sense, when you do what’s good for your customers 
it’s generally good for you.”
While providing access to the PermID system can help customers with their own internal data 
silo issues, Tim Baker sees the benefit for Thomson Reuters in “making [its] data much easier 
to use, which in turn makes it more accessible, more cost effective, and hopefully more widely 
used by [its] customers as a result”. By providing the tools to integrate its data products and 
internal client data, Thomson Reuters saw a clear business opportunity.
The case for opening up PermID
Thomson Reuters then had to decide how to expose PermID to its customers. Past experience 
has taught the industry that releasing proprietary identifiers with restrictive licensing conditions 
can create significant problems. One key issue is reusers’ inability to expose these proprietary 
identifiers to their own clients, and even to other departments within their business, in some 
cases. This has made people approach new proprietary identifiers with caution.
Thomson  Reuters  realised  that  the  only  way  customers  would  embrace  and  be  able  to  
recognise the full potential of PermID was if it took a radically different approach – an open 
approach.  Thomson  Reuters  and  the  Open  Data  Institute  (ODI)  had  already  explored  the 
importance of identifiers in such an approach, in an earlier white paper which laid some of the 
groundwork for PermID.
8
 “All we’re trying to do is make it easier for our customers to work 
with us,” explains Dan Bennett. “Only through making it open data was it actually going to 
be a reasonable experience for our customers.” Dan Meisner, Head of Capability for Open 
Data, agrees: “For our customers, it’s that commitment to openness of the identifier and of  
the information model that‘s important.”

Making a commercial case for open
While  it  was  clear  that  allowing  anyone  to  access,  use  or  share  the  data  was  the  only  way  
to fully recognise the potential benefits of PermID, being a commercial organisation meant 
that Thomson Reuters had to justify this decision internally. This can be challenging, because 
“customers see an awful lot of value in this but commercially it’s not easy to put a value on,” 
notes Dan Bennett. “The benefits from this to us are mainly tangential,” he adds. The issue is, 
as Dan Meisner puts it, that these indirect benefits and network effects “don’t really fit very 
well into an Excel model for calculating your internal rate of return”.
Ultimately the financial case was made, as Dan Bennett explains:
“We don’t exist to make money out of issuing those identifiers. We create those identifiers 
because it’s important to our internal data model. The reality is that we have this data 
and are managing it anyway, so the incremental cost for us to expose it externally is not 
that great in the grand scheme of things.”
As  such  Thomson  Reuters  decided  to  publish  a  subset  of  its  data,  including  associated 
PermIDs, under an open Creative Commons licence (CC-BY 4.0). An extended set of fields 
offering further descriptions of the entities in question has been released under a Creative 
Commons non-commercial licence (CC-NC 3.0). They launched this service as Open PermID 
in 2015,
9
 achieving an ODI Open Data Certificate in the process of release.
10
Unlocking benefits to PermID itself
The  benefits  of  providing  this  data  openly  are  not  limited  to  customers.  In  addition  to  
recognising the indirect financial benefits of increased data use, Thomson Reuters expects 
open licensing will benefit the data itself. Because the data is open, Thomson Reuters can 
gain valuable external feedback not only from clients but also from others who choose to use 
the  data  because  they  all  have  a  vested  interest  in  its  accuracy.  “It’s  a  bit  like  open  source  
software,” says Dan Bennett, “... which is generally thought to be more secure because you 
have more eyes on it. In the same way, having more eyes on our data will make it gradually 
stronger and richer.”

10 Open enterprise: how three big businesses create value with open innovation | Open Data Institute 2016
Not only does the company expect opening the data will improve its accuracy but, because 
linked data is used, when others link their own external open data sources to the PermID data, 
it enriches and increases the value of the Thomson Reuters data without additional effort.
Unlocking PermID also opens up new solutions for Thomson Reuters to sell. These include 
Thomson Reuters Intelligent Tagging which uses PermID when tagging unstructured data, 
helping organisations to enhance the value of their content sets.
Securing a future through an open approach
Regardless  of  any  related  commercial  opportunities,  in  making  the  decision  to  release  
PermID under an open licence, Thomson Reuters is looking well beyond immediate costs 
and benefits. The company fundamentally sees the release as part of a long-term strategy 
responding  to  emerging  trends  and  challenges  in  the  industry.  One  of  the  main  trends  
concerning Thomson Reuters is that “in many ways, we’re in a post-scarcity world for data,” 
explains Dan Meisner. Thomson Reuters is keenly aware that the proliferation of data has a 
significant effect. Tim Baker says “as a company, we’ve realised that customers want to use 
data from more and more sources. There’s no value to them in a ‘one-size-fits-all’ approach to 
the data they use.” Dan Meisner agrees:
“Customers  are  grabbing  data  from  different  parts  of  their  own  businesses  [and] 
they’re looking at open data from government sources and elsewhere. The high-quality 
professional reference data that is our bread and butter is not becoming less important, 
but it’s becoming less of an overall component of our clients’ enterprise data inventory.”
In the face of these changes, which Dan Meisner describes as “moving towards a networked 
data economy”, Thomson Reuters sees its role as an actor that can “help the industry take this 
wealth of data and make it actionable information”. The company believes it is well positioned 
to do this because of its existing expertise in data integration. As Tim Baker puts it:
“In the past, there was a lot of value in the way data companies acquired, organised 
and presented information for their clients. And to an extent there always will be, but the 
real value now lies in the underlying data models, the naming mechanisms and the tools 
used to extract meaning from and link data. This is where our customers are looking for 
us to help them, and we’ve been reshaping our business to meet this need.”

11 Open enterprise: how three big businesses create value with open innovation | Open Data Institute 2016
Thomson Reuters believes PermID forms a key part of this value proposition and that the timing 
of its release is also key.
11
 “I think there’s a sense that if we don’t do it, somebody else might,” 
explains Dan Meisner. Having witnessed the rise of platform firms across the tech sector, the 
company is determined to experiment and emulate the model. Dan Meisner explains:
“Increasing amounts of open data are being published, and we’re making the investment 
to  be  a  foundational  part  of  this  future  ecosystem.  The  basic  idea  is  that  just  as  this  
has helped us connect data from around our own organisation, it should then help our 
customers, our partners, and maybe even our competitors do the same with their data, 
and plug that into our organisation, our platform.”
By positioning itself in this way, Thomson Reuters believes it can cement its position in the 
information industry for the foreseeable future. “The environment our customers operate in has 
fundamentally changed, and we have evolved our business model to suit,” says Tim Baker. 
“We’re  becoming  an  open  platform  for  our  customers,  a  core  piece  of  their  operating  
infrastructure.”
Open for business
Thomson Reuters has taken this approach not only to help its clients integrate their data but 
also to help them, and others, to better manage internal data. The company believes making 
it easier for customers to integrate Thomson Reuters data will increase its value and usage. In 
addition, by combining open data with stable identifiers, it gives clients freedom to experiment, 
link their own open or proprietary data and provide feedback on the identifier system, all of 
which makes PermID a stronger offering – both internally and externally. Thomson Reuters is 
also well positioned to create a platform based on its data and information model, becoming a 
central component in a future ecosystem. By embracing linked open data, Thomson Reuters 
is creating a competitive advantage in paving the way to build new products and generate new 
business models – both now and in the future.

Arup builds a network of open innovators
Arup is a multinational  professional services  firm  that provides  design,  engineering  and  
consulting services for the built environment. It has around 11,000 employees and had a 
turnover of £1.05bn in 2014.
Using open data
Arup has long used publicly available data from a number of sources, including the Office 
for National Statistics (ONS). Its Digital Insight team makes use of ONS demographic data in 
urban planning and design projects as well as environmental statements and assessments. 
It also uses publicly available geospatial data to derive location-based insight for its clients. 
For example, its Hazard Owl risk information system uses real-time environmental data to 
constantly assess the risk of damage to commercial assets, such as office buildings or factories.
The use of open data is becoming increasingly common across the large number of projects 
the company works on at any given time. As Damien McCloud, Digital Insight Leader, explains:
“We increasingly and always have had a need for third-party data. Clearly the emergence 
of  open  data  is  now  getting  to  a  point  where  the  availability  and  reliability  of  that  will  
impact on how we work as a firm globally.”
This impact is well demonstrated by Arup’s use of open data in combination with open source 
software in its built environment projects. For example, in sandscaping – the management of 
sand to support coastal protection or regeneration – Arup developed an open source system 
that ingests demographic, environmental and geospatial open data to help users locate the 
best areas for sandscaping and analyse project impact.
Finding new ways of collaborating
Alongside  the  use  of  open  data,  a  key  aspect  of  Arup’s  increasingly  open  approach  to   
innovation is the way in which it partners closely with open data startups. Traditionally, Arup 
would  complete  its  research  and  development  (R&D)  in  house  in  order  to  develop  new 
commercial services or improve existing ones, sometimes working with academia and other 
groups. The firm is now shifting to a more open, collaborative approach, in which it experiments 
more with external ideas as well as internal ones, and different paths to market. It is currently 
working in this way with two open data startups previously incubated at the ODI, Mastodon C 
and OpenSensors.

13 Open enterprise: how three big businesses create value with open innovation | Open Data Institute 2016
Mastodon  C  is  a  specialist  big  data  company.  It  provides  data  science  and  technology   
services  to  a  range  of  different  organisations  to  help  them  better  understand  and  gain 
insights from their data. In a recent project for one of Arup’s clients, it used its data science 
expertise to help Arup quickly derive commercial insight from vast amounts of data related to  
airport infrastructure.
A  fellow  graduate  of  the  ODI  Startup  programme,
12
  OpenSensors  is  an  online  platform  that  
enables anyone to publish real-time sensor data. As well as enabling users to better manage 
their own closed data, the platform is building a repository of open data that can be accessed, 
used and shared by anyone. Arup first worked with OpenSensors to install 200 sensors across 
its own London offices. The purpose of the installation was to help Arup take a hands-on 
approach to Internet of Things (IoT) research that could be scaled up quickly and effectively. 
Arup is now looking to work together with the two startups on further commercial work, such 
as the creation of a new asset monitoring platform.
Absorbing new ideas, technologies and data
The  prime  motivation  for  adopting  this  approach  to  open  innovation  and  becoming  a   
‘porous organisation’ is the realisation that rapid, disruptive change is unlikely to come solely 
from within. Large organisations like Arup will have to quickly absorb new ideas, technologies 
and data in order to remain competitive over the long-term. Volker Buscher, Director, Arup 
Digital, explains how:
“We think there are domains that would benefit not just from open data but an open 
innovation  process.  It’s  not  just  data,  it’s  also  open  source  in  terms  of  code  or  the  
development of other digital assets.
“I  can’t  see  an  end  to  digital  disruption  rolling  into  our  industry.  The  idea  that  we  will  
have all the experts in house is unrealistic.”
Beyond direct project work, this approach has the potential for wider, long-term impact across 
the  business.  Working  with  startups  in  this  way  means  new  ideas  are  injected  into  Arup’s  
values, principles and policies. This is particularly relevant to the ethical considerations to be 
made around the use, reuse and sharing of data. Working this closely enables both sides to 
shape the other’s thinking.

14 Open enterprise: how three big businesses create value with open innovation | Open Data Institute 2016
An experimental approach – where targets are often more loosely defined, with fewer concrete 
objectives  or  plans  –  requires  an  attitude  to  licensing  and  Intellectual  Property  (IP)  that  is  
different to that taken by most large organisations. According to Volker Buscher, this attitude 
is particularly likely to be shared by startups incubated at the ODI:
“Open innovation frameworks and the use of Apache licensing for code development 
and sharing is really attractive to both sides. It allows us to create IP without having to 
have complex legal agreements, lawyers, and background and foreground IP discussion 
that just slows everything down in this new world.
“What I found is that startups coming out of the ODI already have that understanding in 
their fabric. Some of the bigger companies that we work with or other startups without 
that background have a different view of the world. You spend more time with their 
lawyers than with their developers.”
Bringing about faster change
From a startup’s perspective, Arup’s way of working provides a number of benefits, including 
no  demands  for  equity,  the  retention  of  autonomy,  and  immediate  access  to  clients  and  
markets. Volker Buscher says:
“The principle thing we bring is scaling. If we set up the asset monitoring platform that 
we are discussing with [the startups], we will be able to contact 100 clients within months 
– a different scale and a different pace than they would have been able to otherwise.”
For  Arup,  the  combination  of  skills  and  expertise  enables  it  to  scale  promising  projects 
more quickly. Working in partnership with the startups also allows them to rapidly move into 
emerging domains and seize opportunities that similar firms may not yet even be aware of. 
Volker Buscher explains that:
“The  biggest  cost  of  not  adopting  this  approach  would  be  the  loss  of  speed.   
We’ve  been  working  with  data  and  data  analytics  forever  –  we  invented  some  of  the  
structural analytics tools used around the world. That, in itself, is not new to us.
“But when we understood the scale and complexity of distributed data architectures, 
combined  with  wanting  to  get  involved  with  things  immediately,  this  approach  [was]  
needed. It is so much quicker than hiring a whole bunch of people or organising complex 
sub-consulting agreements.”

15 Open enterprise: how three big businesses create value with open innovation | Open Data Institute 2016
Arup is currently in the process of quantifying the exact benefits of adopting this approach to 
open innovation. It is also exploring how it can publish its own open data in a way that creates 
tangible commercial value. On reflection, Volker Buscher contrasts his company’s approach 
with the one taken by other large organisations:
“There  are  lots  of  big  businesses  that  have  got  accelerators  or  incubators  but  they  
usually involve investing in the startup, taking equity out and having very clear IP rules 
attached.  That’s  a  completely  reasonable  model  that  lots  of  companies  use.  We  are  
exploring a different way of doing it.”

Syngenta supports sustainability with open data 
Syngenta  is  a  global  agriculture  business  that  helps  farmers  make  better  use  of  their  
available resources, primarily through agrochemical and seed production. In order to continue 
to advance crop productivity, it invested more than $1.4bn in research and development (R&D) 
across 150 international sites in 2014.
Data-driven R&D
Syngenta has a history of using publicly available data in its R&D. Alongside data related 
to land, weather and soil conditions, it uses biological data that has been published openly 
to  build  a  detailed  understanding  of  crop  (and  pest)  traits  –  like  tolerance  of  environmental  
pressures  and  resistance  to  viruses.  Derek Scuffell,  Data  Strategist  for  R&D  Information 
Systems at Syngenta, describes how:
“We certainly have made use of a mix of satellite data that we buy and public satellite 
data. In R&D, what we make really heavy use of is huge amounts of public molecular 
biology data, which in Europe is mainly hosted by the European Bioinformatics Institute.”
In  2014  Syngenta  funded  the  European  Bioinformatics  Institute  (EMBL-EBI)  to  extract   
bioactivity  data  from  a  large  number  of  academic  journals.  The  data  covered  insecticides,  
fungicides  and  herbicides,  including  more  than  40,000  compound  records  related  to  crop  
protection. It was made available as open data through the ChEMBL database of bioactive 
molecules – Syngenta’s first experience of making data available for anyone to access, use 
and share.

Publishing Syngenta’s own open data
A year later, the company decided to publish its own open data as part of its Good Growth 
Plan. The plan addresses the long-term challenge of ensuring global food security for a rapidly 
rising  global  population.  It  focuses  on  the  sustainability  of  Syngenta’s  business  and  seeks  
to support transformation and change within the organisation by setting out six significant 
commitments.

In  April  2015  Syngenta  collaborated  with  the  ODI  to  make  six  open  datasets  available  
related to its Good Growth Plan, including descriptions of productivity, soil, biodiversity and 
smallholder reach.
15
 The data will be updated yearly to measure the plan’s actual performance 
against  its  stated  commitments.  It  is  collected  by  external  companies  as  well  as  Syngenta.  
The  reporting  process,  its  quality  controls  and  evidence  is  independently  assured  by  PwC  
and the datasets achieved Silver level Open Data Certificates, verified by the ODI. One of 
Syngenta’s  key  motivations  for  collecting  and  publishing  data  in  this  way  was  to  develop  
external trust in the plan, which is essential for strengthening collaboration between private 
and public stakeholders for global food security. Making the data available has brought about 
an unprecedented level of transparency for the company.
Moving beyond transparency to wider use
As  well  as  enabling  anyone  to  assess  the  performance  of  the  Good  Growth  Plan  for   
themselves,  publishing  open  data  has  had  an  instrumental  role  in  the  plan’s  promotion  and  
communication. Head of Data Sciences Graham Mullier explains how the open data release 
caught public attention in a way that wasn’t expected:
“We’ve done publicity around the Good Growth Plan in the past when it was launched. 
The  interest  and  engagement  that  we  got  from  a  much  lower-key  open  data  press  
release, all on its own, triggered similar levels of interest to some of the more expensive 
media-driven  pushes  we  have  done  before.  We  were  surprised  at  the  way  in  which  
people picked up on the story.”
Syngenta  is  now  actively  exploring  other  potential  uses  of  the  data.  For  example,  its  
productivity  dataset  includes  agricultural  efficiency  indicators  for  over  3,600  farms  in 
41    countries  across  Europe,  Africa,  Latin  America,  North  America  and  Asia  Pacific.  
Elisabeth  Fischer,  a  development  economist  at  Syngenta,  hopes  that  this  data  will   
eventually be used by farmers around the world for resource efficiency benchmarking:
“This is data that tells you how much input farmers needed in that year to produce a 
certain output. The data can be very interesting in countries where such data doesn’t 
exist to provide a reference point. For example, if I farm my land and I need significantly 
more input than the benchmark, then maybe I have an opportunity to reduce my input 
needs and maybe it helps me find that solution.”

18 Open enterprise: how three big businesses create value with open innovation | Open Data Institute 2016
In this scenario, a solution could then be developed by the farmer, together with their agronomic 
advisors, in a way that meets the commitments of the Good Growth Plan itself. The company 
is  looking  at  ways  the  data  could  be  improved  and  made  more  useful,  such  as  including  
farming practices or other details. As Elisabeth Fischer explains:
“[We see a need to] create a platform where farmers can get access to this information 
and benchmark themselves against what others are doing. To make it more relevant, we 
work to increase the scope of the data.
“Eventually  we  want  this  data  to  help  empower  farmers  to  make  better  decisions  on  
what works best for them and their land in order to feed a growing population. But this 
needs more than just our data and our offer. It’s a piece of a puzzle and our contribution 
to developing a collaborative and unbiased approach.”
Adopting a more collaborative approach
For  Syngenta,  opening  up  some  of  its  data  represents  a  wider,  ongoing  shift  to  a  more 
collaborative business model in which data plays an increasingly significant part. It is estimated 
that there will be more than 20.8bn Internet of Things (IoT) connected devices by 2020.
16  
As the 
quantities of data collected by these devices in the agriculture sector grow, Graham Mullier 
believes  that  Syngenta  will  need  to  work  in  tandem  with  others  to  meet  the  challenges  laid   
out in the Good Growth Plan:
“The rate of data generation is increasing. The granularity is getting finer and finer all 
the time. All of that gives us loads more data to work with and the chances of any one 
organisation being able to generate the data, host the data, analyse the data and come 
up with brilliant answers all on their own seems vanishingly small. We have to find ways 
of collaborating.”
Through its own open data release and contributions to the Global Open Data for Agriculture 
and  Nutrition  (GODAN)  initiative,  Syngenta  is  playing  an  active  role  in  bringing  about  this  
collaboration. Ultimately, it is acutely aware of the costs of not taking this approach and not 
opening up to others in the sector. Derek Scuffell explains his view that:
“... if we don’t have an open data approach then Syngenta will miss out on opportunities 
– those opportunities could be in new technologies or new research.”

Meeting business challenges with open approaches
As businesses get bigger, staying agile and innovative can get harder. The case studies that we 
have examined in this report highlight five big business challenges and the open approaches 
that these organisations are taking to tackle them.
Third-party data: when and how to use it
The availability of data for businesses, governments and people to use in their own decision 
making  is  growing  every  year.  And  models  for  supplying  data  are  becoming  ever  more  
sophisticated – from open data licensing to open APIs, open source data analytics tools and 
platforms, to commercial licences and complex bilateral data-sharing contracts. Each of the 
big  businesses  we  have  described  here  have  become,  at  least  in  part,  digital  businesses  
that supply products and services directly to customers or internally with other parts of the 
organisation.
Arup  has  long-standing  experience  building  products  and  services  using  data  from  third   
parties.  The  growing  availability  of  open  data  has  reduced  their  costs  and  created  
opportunities for competitive advantage. Using open data provides Arup with more space 
to innovate and test new products, in contrast with more traditional third-party data products 
that  can  come  with  restrictive  terms  and  conditions.  The  remaining  challenges  for  Arup  are  
around  data’s  availability  and  reliability.  It  is  easier  to  build  better  services  in  places  where  
more data is available and has inherent flexibility, as this helps Arup to generate  accurate   
insights and trial new approaches more cheaply and efficiently.
Thomson  Reuters  has  taken  an  interesting  route  to  extracting  the  value  of  third-party  
data. Because they have made their own reference data available as open data through 
PermID,  the  team  hope  that  others  will  link  to  it  and  provide  them  with  additional  context  
and information on the organisations they provide data about. This provides the potential for 
Thomson Reuters’ data to be enriched and made more valuable by others, without any 
extra effort on their part.

20 Open enterprise: how three big businesses create value with open innovation | Open Data Institute 2016
Maintaining leadership in competitive data markets 
Some  businesses  have  traditionally  made  their  living  by  selling  access  to  data  that  they   
have  collected,  modelled  and  integrated.  These  organisations  face  a  challenge  living  “in  a  
post-scarcity  world  for  data”,  as  Dan  Meisner from Thomson Reuters put it. They need to 
adapt their business models to the changing technological and competitive landscape.
The  increasing  competition  felt  by  traditional  data  providers  in  the  face  of  the  web   
of data is much like the problems faced by the publishing industry in the face of the web of  
documents. New businesses and business models are emerging that disrupt traditional data 
providers.  Data  collection  is  getting  cheaper  and  easier,  and  it  is  easier  now  than  ever  to  
collaborate on data provision. Existing market leaders must find new business models to avoid 
new competition undermining their business.
Thomson  Reuters  is addressing these challenges through publishing open identifiers and 
data about organisations to:
 drive integration of its products with customer data, embedding ongoing use
 reduce the cost of ownership of other Thomson Reuters products by making its 
data easier to use
 widen its market to include customers who need Thomson Reuters’ data but who 
do not want to be locked into proprietary products
Keeping costs low for the business and for customers
Big businesses are more likely than most to grow through acquisition. As different organisations 
are grafted onto each other, there are frequently systems and data assets that overlap or need 
to  work  together.  Even  in  organisations  that  grow  organically,  issues  around  duplication  of  
data,  systems  incompatibility  and  restrictive  data  licences  can  frustrate  ongoing  use.  And  
as  organisations  increasingly  become  porous  and  open  to  working  with  each  other,  the  
requirements for bringing data together spread outside the boundaries of a single organisation.
For Thomson Reuters, the need to integrate internal systems and data resources led to the 
creation of an open data product. Providing open data helped it to:
 design internal systems that could adapt as Thomson Reuters grew
 integrate Thomson Reuters’ needs with customer needs
 drive uptake of Thomson Reuters products

21 Open enterprise: how three big businesses create value with open innovation | Open Data Institute 2016
This pattern reflects similar evolution in Amazon, where what was to become Amazon Web 
Services was initiated as a response to its CEO Jeff Bezos’ mandate that all Amazon data and 
functionality be available through “externalisable” service interfaces.
17
The  challenge  of  system  integration  is  felt  as  much  by  customers  as  by  big  businesses.   
Providing open interfaces can help provide efficiencies in-house and create value for customers.
Staying agile in shifting environments
While they bring scale, big businesses have a reputation for being sluggish. Slow responses 
to new opportunities are a problem for businesses when their competitive advantage lies in 
technological  capability.  It  is  unrealistic  to  expect  organisations  to  hold  all  the  experts  they  
need  in-house,  but  it  can  be  hard  to  rapidly  take  advantage  of  new  opportunities  through   
hiring  or  subcontracting,  particularly  when  there  is  legal  wrangling  over  the  ownership  of  
intellectual property.
Many  large  businesses  seek  to  inject  innovation  into  their  own  organisations  through   
accelerator  or  incubator  programmes  that  invest  in  startups,  often  gaining  equity  and  
intellectual property rights over what they develop. Arup’s approach is slightly different. While 
it develops close working relationships with the startups it hosts, openness and flexibility form 
the foundation of those relationships. This applies to code, to data, and to a way of operating 
that centres around the free exchange of ideas between big and small businesses.
For Syngenta,  releasing  open  data  was  part  of  its  drive  to  transform  and  change  itself  as  
an organisation. Having externally visible data helps other stakeholders to monitor progress 
and hold Syngenta to account, creating greater impetus for the company to see through its 
commitments.

Collaborating with clients and competitors to address  
big challenges 
While  big  businesses  may  dominate  their  sectors,  the  ‘wicked’  problems  that  they  face  
can  seldom  be  tackled  alone.  Companies  operate  in  a  complex  environment  of  customers,  
competitors,  suppliers,  partners,  governments,  charities  and  communities.  Sometimes  
securing a long-term future for a big business means changing the way the sector works as 
a whole.
For Syngenta, the sector-wide challenge is how to ensure global food security. Recognising 
the  importance  of  collaboration  with  private  and  public  stakeholders  to  achieve  this  goal,  
Syngenta has used open data to:
 develop trust with potential collaborators
 encourage wider data sharing
 incentivise collaboration and discovery

23 Open enterprise: how three big businesses create value with open innovation | Open Data Institute 2016
Big businesses can be big open businesses
The big businesses that we have looked at in this report come from different sectors and have 
different markets. In each case, however, the business has taken  an  open  approach  as  a  
strategic response to challenges that they face.
As part of their approach, Thomson Reuters, Arup and Syngenta have begun to:
 understand their internal use of data, how it should be managed and developed
 articulate  business  cases  for  improving  internal  data  capability  and  increasing  
open data publication
 improve the quality of data they hold
 build trust and collaboration in the market
 enable deeper engagement with customers, collaborators and future partners, 
through feedback on data being published and its uses 
 create partnerships with new startups and market entrants with an open ethos
 build an organisational culture that is open to feedback and insight inside the 
organisation, as well as outside in the environment it operates in
Addressing   the   challenges   that   big   businesses   face,   and   taking   advantage   of   the    
opportunities  that  the  data  revolution  brings,  requires  new  ways  of  thinking  and  operating  
as  a  business.  This  is  not  only  a  technical  challenge  but  also  an  organisational  and  cultural  
challenge. Big businesses that respond to these challenges are creating new business models 
and ways of working that give them a competitive advantage, whatever the future brings.
