Executive summary
‘Data  infrastructure’  consists  of  a  combination  of  data  assets,  technology,  processes  and  
organisations.
1
 In this report we use this definition to explore how the ways in which weather 
and climate data are accessed, used and shared are evolving.
Reviewing weather data’s importance, and the steps in its value chain, we draw attention to:
 the  evolving  role  of  global,  regional  and  national  meteorological  services  in  
collecting observations and generating forecasts
 the technology trends creating new data assets along with new big data challenges
 the growing need for investment in technical infrastructure and supercomputing 
resources  to  drive  improvements  in  forecasting,  and  the  pressure  this  puts  on  
ensuring sustainable access to data
Analysing key technology trends and their impacts is important to understanding how weather 
data  infrastructure  is  evolving.  In  studying  these  drivers  we  hope  to  encourage  discussion  
around how our global weather data infrastructure can be sustainable and continue to bring 
significant value to society, while remaining as open as possible.

4 The state of weather data infrastructure | Open Data Institute 2017
Introduction
From its early beginnings over 150 years ago, weather forecasting at the Met Office has been 
driven  by  data.  Simple  observations  recorded  and  used  to  hand-plot  synoptic  charts  have  
been exchanged for the billions of observations received and handled every day, mainly from 
satellites but also from weather stations, radar, ocean buoys, planes, shipping and the public. 
However, the huge amounts of data collected, modelled and processed by the supercomputer 
continues to increase exponentially. This creates a challenge to send weather data to a growing 
number of consumers via a variety of applications and services, on time and in full.
In this paper, the Open Data Institute (ODI) and the Met Office explore the current state of 
weather data infrastructure. By looking at the different aspects of the data infrastructure used 
to  collect,  access  and  share  weather  and  climate  information,  we  can  better  understand  
challenges.
We hope that by highlighting these challenges we can engage a wide community in agreeing 
the best way forward.
The importance of weather data
Like  geographical  data,  information  about  the  weather  and  climate  is  of  critical  importance  
to many popular applications. Its use benefits society in general as well as many different 
commercial activities. Weather and climate data can help:
 reduce risks relating to climate- and weather-related disasters
 ensure safe transport of people and freight
 create resilience in the face of climate change and variation
 support sustainable use of natural resources
 drive economic growth across a number of industries
Reports by the ODI have highlighted the importance of weather data in addressing a number 
of  global  development  changes  (Atz  et  al,  2015)  and  its  role  in  supporting  our  global  food  
system (Carolan et al, 2015). The Met Office has estimated that in the UK alone the Public 
Weather Service contributes more than £1 billion to the national economy.

5 The state of weather data infrastructure | Open Data Institute 2017
Economics and Statistics Administration suggests that US weather forecasts can be valued at 
$31.5 billion dollars per year (Callen, 2014).
These valuations reflect the fact that all of us consume weather information as part of our daily 
lives, while organisations large and small are using the same information to make decisions 
about how they operate and grow. A robust weather data infrastructure is essential to preserving 
people’s safety and for ensuring healthy global, national and regional economies.
There are opportunities to unlock even more value from weather data. With increasing accuracy 
it becomes possible to create new products and services that are tailored for specific sectors 
as well as the general public. For example, fine-grained localised forecasting could help route 
air traffic or guide construction projects. Achieving these benefits requires our weather data 
infrastructure to adapt and grow.
The weather data value chain
There are a number of steps involved in drawing value from weather data. At each stage, a 
number of organisations are involved. National Meteorological Services (NMSs) play a pivotal 
role in collecting, generating and sharing information as part of their mandate. But achieving 
this means collaborating with a variety of organisations.
The key stages of the weather data value chain are as follows:
 Monitoring and observation of the weather and environment, e.g. by NMSs.
 Numerical weather prediction (NWP) and climate modelling carried out by NMSs 
to create global, regional and limited area weather forecasts. Private companies 
are  growing  their  presence  in  the  market  and  challenging  the  traditional  role  
of  NMSs  to  provide  forecasts  to  the  public,  by  statistically  blending  data  from  
NMS models to create their own forecast models, for example. Other companies 
providing data via online channels and/or apps include The Weather Company, 
Accuweather or the Climate Corporation.
 Communication  and  dissemination  of  forecasts  by  news,  NMS  and  media  
organisations  like  the  BBC,  Yahoo  and  Google,  or  within  consumer-targeted  
mobile and web applications.
 Decision making by individuals and businesses across a variety of sectors, which 
draws on weather data and reporting.
Trust, accuracy and reliability are important parts of this overall value chain. 

6 The state of weather data infrastructure | Open Data Institute 2017
What are the key elements of our global weather data 
infrastructure?
The Open Data Institute defines data infrastructure as consisting of: 
 data  assets,  e.g.  datasets  collected  and  created,  and  analysis  carried  out  on  
them
 the organisations that operate and maintain those assets and technologies
 the technologies and processes that allow those assets to be accessed, used 
and shared by those who could benefit (The Open Data Institute, 2016)
Useful  and  accessible  data  infrastructure  requires  funding  to  make  it  sustainable,  or  the 
provision of large dynamic datasets to end users is impacted. To help build a picture of weather 
data infrastructure, we look at each of these areas in turn.
What data assets are produced in weather data 
infrastructure?
The core data asset of our global weather data infrastructure is observation data that captures 
a continuous record of weather and climate data around the world. This includes temperature, 
rainfall, wind speed and details of a host of other atmospheric, surface and marine conditions.
The collection of observation data is a global effort. The Global Observing System consists 
of  around  11,000  ground-based  monitoring  stations  supplemented  with  thousands  of  
sensors  installed  on  weather  balloons,  aircraft  and  ships.
3
  Observations  are  also  collected  
from a network of radar installations and satellite-based sensors. As we see later, the ‘official’ 
observation system is increasingly being supplemented with new sources of observation data 
from the Internet of Things (IoT).
A combination of historical and current observations is processed using complex numerical 
models  to  generate  another  important  set  of  data  assets:  detailed  weather  and  climate  
forecasts. Forecasts are generated at global, regional and national levels with increasing levels 
of detail to give insight into local conditions.
3 See: ‘Observation components of the Global Observing System’ at: http://www.wmo.int/pages/prog/www/OSY/Gos-
components.html.

The  collected  observations  are  analysed  and  used  to  help  define  the  starting  point  for 
subsequent forecasts. This process is called data assimilation. For early developments in 
NWP, assimilation was mostly concerned with observations at the main synoptic hours and a 
snapshot evaluation of the model state was an appropriate approach. Today’s observations are 
dominated by asynoptic satellite and aircraft measurements, where there is a more continuous 
stream of data. Adding a time dimension to the traditional 3D analysis techniques provides a 
better way of representing this process. 
Forecasts  draw  on  large  and  complex  datasets.  There  are  two  types  of  forecast  models:  
deterministic  and  probabilistic.  Deterministic  models  produce  a  single  forecast  of  the  most  
likely weather. Probabilistic models are generated by running a forecast multiple times with 
different starting conditions to generate multiple projections of possible weather conditions. 
This is known as the ensemble approach. 
Ensemble model forecasts aim to give an indication of the range of possible future states of the 
atmosphere and oceans (which are a significant driver of the weather in the atmosphere). This 
overcomes errors introduced by using imperfect measurement of initial starting conditions that 
are then amplified by the chaotic nature of the atmosphere. Increasing the number of forecast 
members  over  a  global  scale  and  at  higher  resolutions  result  in  data  volumes  increasing  
exponentially.
The deterministic and ensemble model data is transformed by NMS and private companies 
into many other data products targeted at specific uses and industries. These include, for 
example, the weather reports provided to the broadcast media industry, forecasts tailored for 
the aviation industry or weather warnings for emergency responders.
Key findings:
 The primary weather data asset is the ongoing observation of our global weather 
and climate systems from a variety of space, atmospheric, ocean and land-based 
sources.
 Ensemble  models  are  used  to  create  accurate  short,  medium  and  long-term  
weather and climate forecasts but generate very large data volumes.
 Forecasts are used to create information, products and services that are consumed 
by the public, media and other sectors.

8 The state of weather data infrastructure | Open Data Institute 2017
What organisations are involved?
Global weather data infrastructure involves a number of public- and private-sector organisations 
working at different scales of geography. 
Created in 1950, The World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) is made up of 191 member 
states and territories around the world. The WMO was founded on the principle that global 
coordination was necessary to reap the benefits of weather and climate data. This includes a 
commitment to weather data and products being freely exchanged around the world (Obasi, 
1995).
A similar set of principles underpins the production and use of climate data.
4
While  the  WMO  has  a  global  outlook,  its  work  is  supplemented  by  regional  meteorological  
organisations like the European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) and 
NMSs, such as the Met Office in the UK.
The capabilities and role of NMSs varies considerably around the world. Firstly, while all nations 
contribute to the gathering of weather observations, individual countries differ in the level of 
monitoring and sensor infrastructure they have available for collecting data. Secondly, there 
are differences in the forecasting services provided by different NMSs. While some larger 
NMSs  provide  global  deterministic  and  probabilistic  forecasts,  others  focus  on  collecting  
observations and offer a more limited range of forecasts. In these cases, leaving others in the 
value chain to provide additional forecasting data and products. 
Gaps in service offerings from NMSs might also be covered by regional meteorological services. 
For example, projects like the WMO’s Global Data-processing and Forecasting system
5
 and 
the ECMWF both provide additional support for countries at the regional and national level.

and-forecasting-system. 

9 The state of weather data infrastructure | Open Data Institute 2017
Key findings:
 There are a variety of global, regional and national meteorological organisations 
that collectively maintain our global infrastructure and consume its data assets.
 NMSs vary in their responsibilities – some focus purely on their mandate while 
others offer additional services.
 There are a mix of public- and private-sector organisations involved in the weather 
data value chain.
What are the technologies and processes?
Weather  data  and  forecasts  need  to  be  delivered  to  the  widest  possible  audience,  in  a  
sustainable way, internationally. 
The first level of data sharing – reflecting the first steps in the value chain – involves observation 
and forecast data being exchanged between meteorological services. National and regional 
forecasts require the use of data from other geographic areas, making data sharing an important 
part of the overall system.
Much  of  the  essential  data  transfer  between  NMSs  currently  happens  across  custom  
networks, such as the WMO Global Telecommunication System
6
 (GTS) which uses dedicated 
network  infrastructure,  satellite  and  radio  broadcasts  to  share  observations  and  forecasts.  
This networking infrastructure has existed for many years and predates the internet. The WMO 
is building on its GTS to achieve an overarching WMO Information System
7
 (WIS), enabling 
systematic access, retrieval, dissemination and exchange of data and information of all WMO 
and related international programmes.
The  critical  importance  of  weather  data  means  that  the  resilience  of  the  overall  system  is  
constantly  under  review.  For  example,  adding  or  removing  individual  observation  sites  may  
improve or reduce the quality of weather forecasts around the world. Reductions in the number 
or quality of observations in one country, for example, can impact the quality of forecasts 
in other countries (Ingleby et al, 2016).  Simulations are often carried out to understand the 
impacts of expected and unexpected changes to the observation network.

10 The state of weather data infrastructure | Open Data Institute 2017
In later stages of the weather data value chain, data and information are shared more widely 
with consumers to comply with legislative requirements, such as the Reuse of Public Sector 
Information and Competition Law within the UK. 
Weather data has traditionally been shared as bulk downloads. Consumers have generally used 
the File Transfer Protocol (FTP) to download the latest forecasts generated by meteorological 
services.  But  these  traditional  data  dissemination  methods  are  becoming  unsustainable  as  
datasets produced by NMSs grow exponentially.
There  are  a  number  of  technologies  that  can  make  disseminating  large  datasets  more  
sustainable. 
First, providing weather data via APIs enables NMSs to allow users to be more selective over 
the data they want, rather than receiving a large data file containing information they may not 
need. A few NMSs already use APIs as dissemination platforms. For example, the Met Office’s 
DataPoint
9
 service provides a variety of APIs that allow application developers to remotely 
query the Met Office’s observation and forecast data. These APIs allow consumers to extract 
only the data they need for their applications, at the right granularity and in well-defined formats. 
Cloud services are increasingly used. For example, the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric 
Administration (NOAA) have recently started a ‘big data project’, which uses partnerships with 
cloud  service  providers  –  such  as  Amazon,  Google  and  Microsoft  –  to  make  data  available  
within their platforms.
10
 This removes the need for developers to constantly move data between 
environments.
Key findings:
 The technical infrastructure for sharing data between NMSs differs from that used 
to share data more widely.
 Careful resilience planning and monitoring ensures that the observation network 
remains effective.
 Meteorological  services  are  beginning  to  embrace  new  technologies,  including  
APIs  and  cloud  services,  in  order  to  better  share  data  with  consumers.

11 The state of weather data infrastructure | Open Data Institute 2017
How is weather data infrastructure evolving?
Based on this summary of the current state of weather data infrastructure, we can reflect on 
how it is evolving. In particular, it is useful to ask:
 What are the new data assets or sources of data? 
 Is there a changing mix of organisations involved in managing global data 
infrastructure?
 How are the technologies evolving? 
These questions are explored in the following sections.
What are the new sources of weather data?
There are increasing new sources of weather observation data. In recent years, services like 
Weather Underground and the Met Office’s Weather Observation Website have demonstrated 
the potential for people around the world to contribute weather observations about their local 
areas  –  using  low-cost  home  weather  stations  and  sensors,  for  example.  But  there  is  now  
potential for sensors in cities, homes, cars, cell towers and even mobile phones to contribute 
observational data that could also be fed into forecast models. 
The Weather Signal mobile application
11
 is one example of these non-traditional data sources. 
These new data sources could improve coverage in countries with less-developed infrastructure 
(Snow, 2013).
This  increasing  variety  of  observational  data  exacerbates  the  big  data  challenge.  There  is  
increasing volumes of data to be collected, and work is required to understand its quality and 
role in adding value and insight into the weather data value chain.
11   See: ‘App turns smartphone sensors into weather stations’ at: https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn23506-app-turns-
smartphone-sensors-into-weather-stations

12 The state of weather data infrastructure | Open Data Institute 2017
Key findings:
 There are many new ‘non-traditional’ sources of observation data, e.g. sensors in 
homes, cities and phones.
 New data sources are producing an increasing volume of data to be collected and 
processed.
 Data quality is not necessarily increasing, meaning that more analysis is needed 
to extract value.
How is the profile of organisations changing?
Given the growth of weather data sources, many new organisations are becoming involved in 
the weather data value chain. Many are from businesses that are using new technologies or 
cloud platforms to create new weather data and products.
For example:
 Organisations  like  PlanetIQ  are  using  new  technology  to  offer  commercially 
licensed weather observations from their own satellite network.
 New  types  of  sensors,  such  as  TAMDAR, offer companies like Panasonic the 
ability  to  combine  public  and  private  data  with  custom  forecasting  models  to  
create new commercial forecasts.
12
 IBM recently acquired The Weather Company
13
  with  a  goal  of  combining  their  
weather platform with IBM’s Watson to power a new Internet of Things platform. 
Greater access to both open data and tailored, commercial weather data products is enabling 
a range of new startups and innovators. These are often targeting specific types of users in 
the value chain. For example, following their acquisition by Monsanto, Climate Corp has been 
described as the first billion-dollar open data business. As a ‘digital agriculture’ business they 
are combining weather, soil and field data to provide services to farmers.
12  See: ‘TV maker Panasonic says it has developed the world’s best weather model’ at: http://arstechnica.co.uk/
science/2016/04/panasonic-weather-forecasting-model/.
13  See: ‘IBM closes deal to acquire the weather company’s product and technology business’ at: http://www-03.ibm.com/
press/us/en/pressrelease/48884.wss.

13 The state of weather data infrastructure | Open Data Institute 2017
The increased availability of private sector forecasting and weather products means that some 
meteorological  services  are  choosing  to  focus  only  on  their  core  public  task.  For  example,  
Met Norway
14
 and the Israeli weather service (Meteoworld, 2016) have been embracing open 
data as a means to enable their data to be widely reused and shared. They are showing that an 
open approach can deliver cost savings while enabling other organisations in the value chain 
to provide more services. 
Citizens are also changing how they find and use weather data, with an explosion in the 
adoption of smartphones and demand for timely weather forecasts and warnings. 
Google and other search engines have begun to incorporate weather forecasts directly into 
their search results. However, due to the increasing variety of information providers, it may not 
be clear to consumers where forecasts and related information are being sourced from. 
These issues are creating a number of pressures on existing meteorological services, both in 
terms of sharing their data with a wider audience, and in maintaining their authoritative voice, 
as we will discuss in the final section.
Key findings:
 There are an increasing number of private companies operating at all steps of the 
value chain.
 Consumers may not always be clear on the source of their weather information.
How are weather data infrastructure technologies evolving?
A recent article by the WMO highlights that “Global weather prediction is one of the largest 
scientific  and  technological  challenges  in  the  twenty-first  century”  (Bauer  et  al,  2015).  
Increasing  the  accuracy  of  weather  forecasting  allows  individual  storms  and  other  weather  
events  to  be  predicted  and  tracked  more  precisely,  while  improvements  in  the  accuracy  of  
long-range forecasts enables more effective long-term planning. 
 
Improving accuracy, however, requires significant investment and improvement in numerical 
models  and  computing  infrastructure  necessary  to  run  and  disseminate  their  data  outputs.  
14  See: ‘Met Norway, Data Policy and Data Services’ at: http://met.no/English/Data_Policy_and_Data_Services/.

14 The state of weather data infrastructure | Open Data Institute 2017
Running ensemble forecasting models on millions of observations every hour results in larger 
volumes  of  data  being  created.  This  raises  a  significant  challenge  around  the  collection, 
production, processing and distribution of weather forecasts.
15
The Met Office’s recently acquired £97m supercomputer provides the hardware infrastructure 
necessary to run weather forecasts more frequently and at increasing levels of precision.
16
 
The Met Office is now able to provide seasonal predictions with a 62% accuracy (MacGregor, 
2016). Every hourly run of the ensemble model currently generates 400 GB of data, and this is 
projected to increase to 1TB per hour by 2020. 
Growing  volumes  of  forecast  data  create  challenges  in  how  it  can  be  made  available  to  
customers. Its sheer volume makes it prohibitive to ship all the raw files to users in a timely 
manner. Traditional approaches like FTP and bulk downloads do not scale, impacting the 
sustainability of the weather data infrastructure.  
It takes sophisticated analysis and computing infrastructure to draw value from forecast data. 
Many  potential  consumers  do  not  have  access  to  the  necessary  computing  resources  or  
expertise required to successfully use the data.
As a result, many meteorological services are exploring cloud infrastructure – like commodity 
cloud  services  –  to  scale  out  how  they  process  and  deliver  their  forecasting  data.  But  this  
creates another challenge in that all data that should be made available under mandate need 
to be transmitted on time and in full. 
While running limited area and time weather forecast models (NWP) in the cloud is possible, 
developing  the  models  themselves  is  not  feasible  in  a  cloud  architecture.  Also,  initialising  
weather models from observations,
17
 long time series or large areal coverage are not practical 
or affordable to run in existing or projected cloud-based environments. They require highly 
specialised computer architecture optimised for these tasks. While these activities are expected 
to  become  possible  using  cloud-based  architectures  in  the  future,  the  high  performance  
requirements for timely delivery of NWP suggest that it is not likely to be affordable for a least 
a decade.

assimilation-methods.

15 The state of weather data infrastructure | Open Data Institute 2017
NMSs,  with  global  deterministic  and  ensemble  models,  have  to  consider  alternatives.  For  
example, they will need to allow users to run their analysis ‘on premise’, enabling customers 
to select and pull the data of interest, which may not be available on cloud services. This is 
known as ‘taking the problem to the data’.
18
The Met Office has recognised the impacts of disseminating large datasets, recently creating 
a  campaign  called  the  ‘Big  Data  Drive’.
19
  Its  aim  is  to  highlight  the  big  data  challenge,  and  
how that challenge can be addressed through the creation of a discoverable and accessible 
platform using industry open standards (Carne, 2016). This will enable data customers to 
choose  the  data  they  want,  in  the  form  they  want  and  at  the  speed  and  service  level  they  
require.
 
Key findings:
 Meteorological services have a big data problem: the increasing volume, variety 
and velocity of forecasting data mean new dissemination approaches are needed.
 There are substantial costs associated with creating more accurate forecasts and 
providing a sustainable infrastructure that will allow it to be used by consumers.
 There is a need for more open standards to facilitate data interchange between 
different organisations in the value chain.

The future challenges for our weather data infrastructure
In this review we have highlighted several technology trends that are starting to have an impact 
on our global weather data infrastructure.
 There is an increasing variety of sources of weather observations from ground, 
air, sea and space based monitoring and sensors.
 Supercomputing infrastructure is enabling new and improved weather models 
to create more accurate forecasts, generating rapidly increasing volumes of data. 
However, the growth of supercomputing in science and business may be limited 
by the cost considerations of the power required by these systems.
 Cloud-based  platforms  are  enabling  new  ways  to  disseminate  and  analyse  
weather data using APIs and hosted analytical tools.
These trends exist within a wider landscape of innovation and evolving consumer expectations, 
where instant and real-time access to data is becoming the default.
Collectively these factors are starting to create several impacts on the sector:
 Globally, commercial  organisations  are  increasingly  taking  roles  across  the  
whole weather data value chain, creating challenges for national meteorological 
services in maintaining a visible, authoritative voice.
 Meteorological services are facing difficult decisions about how to continue to 
provide open, sustainable access to weather data, while also continuing to invest 
in hardware, technology and platforms to meet customer needs.
 New approaches and platforms are needed to deliver tailored weather products 
in a form that can be easily reused by a variety of data consumers.
These impacts raise questions about the future shape of our global weather data infrastructure. 
We hope that this report will encourage discussion around how that infrastructure should be 
owned and operated.
